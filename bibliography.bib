abstract = {Machining operation planning involves the selection and sequencing of machining operations for fabricating a workpiece. It is the first step in the process of generating a detailed process plan for a workpiece. In the past five years, several knowledge-based systems have been developed. Two knowledge representation schemes are employed: production rules and frames. Each of these exhibits some general properties of human information processing but neglects the other. None of the existing systems is able to solve real-world problems. The main focus of this paper is on a layered architecture for manufacturing knowledge representation and automated reasoning for operation planning. This can be addressed through a discussion of both the knowledge representation structure and the inference mechanism. The proposed layered architecture has been implemented on a microcomputer using PROLOG. The results are satisfactory. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {In the design of industrial products ranging from hearing aids to automobiles and aeroplanes, material is distributed so as to maximize the performance and minimize the cost. Historically, human intuition and insight have driven the evolution of mechanical design, recently assisted by computer-aided design approaches. The computer-aided approach known as topology optimization enables unrestricted design freedom and shows great promise with regard to weight savings, but its applicability has so far been limited to the design of single components or simple structures, owing to the resolution limits of current optimization methods1,2. Here we report a computational morphogenesis tool, implemented on a supercomputer, that produces designs with giga-voxel resolution- more than two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported. Such resolution provides insights into the optimal distribution of material within a structure that were hitherto unachievable owing to the challenges of scaling up existing modelling and optimization frameworks. As an example, we apply the tool to the design of the internal structure of a full-scale aeroplane wing. The optimized full-wing design has unprecedented structural detail at length scales ranging from tens of metres to millimetres and, intriguingly, shows remarkable similarity to naturally occurring bone structures in, for example, bird beaks. We estimate that our optimized design corresponds to a reduction in mass of 2-5 per cent compared to currently used aeroplane wing designs, which translates into a reduction in fuel consumption of about 40-200 tonnes per year per aeroplane. Our morphogenesis process is generally applicable, not only to mechanical design, but also to flow systems3, antennas4, nano-optics5 and micro-systems.},

More precisely, given a simple polygon attached to the two walls of the open pop-up, our polynomial-time algorithm subdivides the polygon into a single-degree-of-freedom linkage structure, such that closing the pop-up flattens the linkage without collision. This result solves an open problem of Hara and Sugihara from 2009. We also show how to obtain a more efficient construction for the special case of orthogonal polygons, and how to make 3D orthogonal polyhedra, from pop-ups that open to 90°, 180°, 270°, or 360°.},

Virtual reality offers both opportunities and challenges for the educational sector. One of the challenges of virtual reality technology is the costs associated which have been unaffordable for educational institutes. However, in recent years, computer hardware and software development has made it more feasible to incorporate virtual reality technology into future teaching strategies. Despite the cost challenges, educational benefits of implementing virtual reality remain compelling. This paper explains virtual reality principle and describes the interactive educational environment developed at WMG, the University of Warwick.

abstract = {The catfishes (Siluriformes) comprise a particularly diverse teleost clade, from a taxonomic, morphological, biogeographical, ecological and behavioural perspective. The Neotropical Trichomycteridae (the “parasitic” catfi shes) are emblematic of this diversity, including fi shes with some of the most specialized habits and habitats among teleosts (e. g. hematophagy, lepidophagy, miniaturization, fossorial habitats, altitudinal extremes). Relatively little information is available on general trichomycterid morphology, as most work so far has concentrated on phylogenetically informative characters, with little concern about general descriptive anatomy. In this paper we provide a synthesis of new and previously-available data in order to build a general picture of basal crown group trichomycterid morphology and of its main modifi cations. We focus on the evolutionary morphology in two relatively distal trichomycterid lineages, i. e. the hematophagous Vandelliinae and the miniature, substrate dwelling Glanapteryginae. New evidence is discussed in relation to the evolution of the opercular system as well as morphological modifi cations in miniature species exhibiting an interstitial life style.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of a lightweight origami-inspired foldable hexapod robot. Using a single sheet of polyester and a laser cutter, the hexapod robot can be fabricated and assembled in less than one hour from scratch. No screw or other external tools are required for assembly. The robot has built-in polyester fasteners considered in its crease pattern. The design uses four-bar mechanisms, which makes the robot flexible to be adjusted for different speeds or other task metrics. For a given desired locomotion velocity, various parameters of the four-bar mechanisms in the crease pattern can be modified accordingly. Design flexibility, ease of fabrication, and low cost make the robot suitable as an agent for swarm objectives. This work presents the foldable hexapod design and its kinematic analysis. The robot is fabricated, assembled, and tested for functionality. Experimental results show that the robot prototype runs with a maximum forward speed of 5 body lengths per second and turns in place with a speed of 1 revolution per second. The final robot weighs 42 grams.},

abstract = {In this review we argue for the creation of a physics of moving systems -- a locomotion "robophysics" -- which we define as the pursuit of the discovery of principles of self generated motion. Robophysics can provide an important intellectual complement to the discipline of robotics, largely the domain of researchers from engineering and computer science. The essential idea is that we must complement study of complex robots in complex situations with systematic study of simplified robophysical devices in controlled laboratory settings and simplified theoretical models. We must thus use the methods of physics to examine successful and failed locomotion in simplified (abstracted) devices using parameter space exploration, systematic control, and techniques from dynamical systems. Using examples from our and other's research, we will discuss how such robophysical studies have begun to aid engineers in the creation of devices that begin to achieve life-like locomotor abilities on and within complex environments, have inspired interesting physics questions in low dimensional dynamical systems, geometric mechanics and soft matter physics, and have been useful to develop models for biological locomotion in complex terrain. The rapidly decreasing cost of constructing sophisticated robot models with easy access to significant computational power bodes well for scientists and engineers to engage in a discipline which can readily integrate experiment, theory and computation.},

abstract = {To achieve the required generality, models designed to predict scaling relationships for diverse groups of animals generally need to be simple. An argument based on considerations of dynamic similarity predicts correctly that the mechanical cost of transport for running [power/(body mass x speed)] will be independent of body mass; but measurements of oxygen consumption for running birds and mammals show that the metabolic cost of transport is proportional to (body mass)-0.32. Thus the leg muscles seem to work more efficiently in larger animals. A model that treats birds as fixed wing aircraft predicts that the mechanical power required for flight at the maximum range speed will be proportional to (body mass)1.02, but the metabolic power is found to be proportional to (body mass)0.83; again, larger animals seem to have more efficient muscles. A model that treats hovering hummingbirds and insects as helicopters predicts mechanical power to be approximately proportional to body mass, but measurements of oxygen consumption once again show efficiency increasing with body mass. A model of swimming fish as rigid submarines predicts power to be proportional to (body mass)0.5 x (speed)2.5 or to (body mass)0.6 x (speed)2.8, depending on whether flow in the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent. Unfortunately, this prediction cannot easily be compared with available compilations of metabolic data. The finding that efficiency seems to increase with body mass, at least in running and flight, is discussed in relation to the metabolic energy costs of muscular work and force.},

abstract = {Force‐platform records and films of kangaroos and a wallaby hopping have been analysed to obtain data about the energetics of hopping and about the stresses which act in muscles, tendons and the tibia. The quantitative anatomical data required for the analysis have been obtained from X‐radiographs and dissections. It is shown that fluctuations of potential energy and external kinetic energy account for most of the energy cost of hopping; fluctuations of internal kinetic energy are relatively unimportant. Evidence is presented that large savings of energy are effected by elastic storage of energy in the gastrocnemius and plantaris tendons. The elastic mechanism is particularly effective at high speeds and seems to account for the observation of Dawson & Taylor (1973) that oxygen consumption is more or less constant over the whole range of hopping speeds. A mathematical model of hopping is presented. The stresses which occur in hopping are discussed. Force platform records and films have been made of kangaroos and a wallaby hopping. The maximum forces exerted on the ground were about six times body weight. The force exerted on the ground changes direction, throughout the period when the feet are on the ground, so that it is always more or less in line with the centre of mass. Consequently the animal decelerates a little and then accelerates again, during the contact phase. The fluctuations of potential energy which occur in each hop are slightly smaller at high speeds than at low ones. Fluctuations of external kinetic energy increase with speed and account for most of the energy cost of hopping at high speeds. Fluctuations of internal kinetic energy (due to acceleration and deceleration of the limbs) are relatively small. While the feet are on the ground the extensor muscles of the hip do positive work, those of the knee negative work and those of the ankle negative work followed by positive work. The energy cost of hopping is reduced substantially by elastic storage of energy in the Achilles tendon. In the case of a wallaby hopping at moderate speed the calculated saving was 40%. The maximum stresses developed in leg muscles, tendons and the tibia have been calculated and are discussed in relation to the known properties of muscle, tendon and bone. The trunk pitches as the animal hops because the two legs swing forwards and back simultaneously. Appropriate tail movements reduce, but do not eliminate, this effect. A mathematical theory of hopping is presented and used to investigate the merits of different hopping techniques. Dawson & Taylor's (1973) discovery that the rate of oxygen consumption of kangaroos decreases a little, as hopping speed increases, is probably to be explained by the increased role of elastic storage of energy at high speeds.

abstract = {Like many phenotypic traits, biomechanical systems are defined by both an underlying morphology and an emergent functional property. The relationship between these levels may have a profound impact on how selection for functional performance is translated into morphological evolution. In particular, complex mechanical systems are likely to be highly redundant, because many alternative morphologies yield equivalent functions. We suggest that this redundancy weakens the relationship between morphological and functional diversity, and we illustrate this effect using an evolutionary model of the four-bar lever system of labrid fishes. Our results demonstrate that, when traits are complex, the morphological diversity of a clade may only weakly predict its mechanical diversity. Furthermore, parallel or convergent selection on function does not necessarily produce convergence in morphology. Empirical observations suggest that this weak form-function relationship has contributed to the morphological diversity of labrid fishes, as functionally equivalent species may nevertheless possess morphologically distinct jaws. We suggest that partial decoupling of morphology and mechanics due to redundancy is a major factor in morphological diversification.},

abstract = {A numerical coupling of two recent methods in shape and topology optimization of structures is proposed. On the one hand, the level set method, based on the classical shape derivative, is known to easily handle boundary propagation with topological changes. However, in practice it does not allow for the nucleation of new holes (at least in 2-d). On the other hand, the bubble or topological gradient method is precisely designed for introducing new holes in the optimization process. Therefore, the coupling of these two method yields an efficient algorithmwhich can escape from local minima in a given topological class of shapes. Both methods rely on the notion of gradient computed through an adjoint analysis, and have a low CPU cost since they capture a shape on a fixed Eulerian mesh. The main advantage of our coupled algorithm is to make the resulting optimal design largely independent of the initial guess.},

While many affordable humanoid standard platforms exist in the lower size ranges of up to 60 cm, beyond this the few available standard platforms quickly become significantly more expensive, and difficult to operate and maintain. In this paper, the igus{\textregistered} Humanoid Open Platform is presented - a new, affordable, versatile and easily customisable standard platform for humanoid robots in the child-sized range. At 90 cm, the robot is large enough to interact with a human-scale environment in a meaningful way, and is equipped with enough torque and computing power to foster research in many possible directions. The structure of the robot is entirely 3D printed, allowing for a lightweight and appealing design. The electrical and mechanical designs of the robot are presented, and the main features of the corresponding open-source ROS software are discussed. The 3D CAD files for all of the robot parts have been released open-source in conjunction with this paper.},

Inspired by biomechanics insights into arthropod locomotion, RHex uses a clock excited alternating tripod gait to walk and run in a highly maneuverable and robust manner. We present empirical data establishing that RHex exhibits a dynamical (“bouncing”) gait—its mass center moves in a manner well approximated by trajectories from a Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP)—characteristic of a large and diverse group of running animals, when its central clock, body mass, and leg stiffnesses are appropriately tuned. The SLIP template can function as a useful control guide in developing more complex autonomous locomotion behaviors such as registration via visual servoing, local exploration via visual odometry, obstacle avoidance, and, eventually, global mapping and localization.},

The input to this process is a 3D geometry (e.g. an OBJ file). The output is a physical object with the specified geometry. We describe an algorithm pipeline that (1) identifies the overall geometry of the input, (2) computes a crease pattern that causes the sheet to self-fold into the desired 3D geometry when activated by uniform heating, (3) automatically generates the design of a 2D sheet with the desired pattern and (4) automatically generates the design files required to fabricate the 2D structure.

abstract = {The DNA origami method allows the folding of long, single-stranded DNA sequences into arbitrary two-dimensional structures by a set of designed oligonucleotides. The method has revealed an unexpected strength and efficiency for programmed self-assembly of molecular nanostructures and makes it possible to produce fully addressable nanostructures with wide-reaching application potential within the emerging area of nanoscience. Here we present a user-friendly software package for designing DNA origami structures ( http://www.cdna.dk/origami ) and demonstrate its use by the design of a dolphin-like DNA origami structure that was imaged by high-resolution AFM in liquid. The software package provides automatic generation of DNA origami structures, manual editing, interactive overviews, atomic models, tracks the design history, and has a fully extendable toolbox. From the AFM images, it was demonstrated that different designs of the dolphin tail region provided various levels of flexibility in a predictable fashion. Finally, we show that the addition of specific attachment sites promotes dimerization between two independently self-assembled dolphin structures, and that these interactions stabilize the flexible tail.},

The proposed design is based on an underactuated configuration of 16 joints and 7 active degrees of freedom. Shape Memory Alloy wires are used as motive elements of a specially designed actuation system installed within the envelope of the hand and forearm; due to their inherent contraction ability when heated, these innovative micro-actuators produce linear motion which is imparted to the fingers via a tendon transmission system. The overall design is completed with the integration of the necessary locking mechanisms for power saving. An experimental prototype of the suggested prosthesis has been fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques and it will be used as an evaluation platform for further research towards the development of a truly multifunctional, silent and cosmetically appealing hand for upper limb amputees.},

Our motion planning formulation simultaneously optimizes over center of mass motion, footholds, and center of pressure for a simplified model that combines trans-verse linear inverted pendulum and vertical spring dynamics. A vertex-based representation of the support area combined with this simplified dynamic model that allows closed form integration leads to a fast nonlinear programming problem formulation. This optimization problem is continuously solved online in a model predictive control approach. The output of the reduced-order planner is fed into a quadratic programming based operational space controller for execution on the full-order system. We present simulation results showing the performance and robustness to disturbances of the planning and control framework. Preliminary results on the physical robot show functionality of the operational space control system, with integration of the trajectory planner a work in progress.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables the production of geometrically complex parts that are difficult to manufacture by other means. However, conventional CAD systems are limited in the representation of such parts. This issue is exacerbated when lattice structures are combined or embedded within a complex geometry. This paper presents a computationally efficient, voxel-based method of generating lattices comprised of practically any cell type that can conform to an arbitrary external geometry. The method of conforming involves the tessellation and trimming of unit cells that can leave ‘hanging' struts at the surface, which is a possible point of weakness in the structure. A method of joining these struts to form an external two dimensional lattice, termed a ‘net-skin' is also described. Traditional methods of manufacturing lattice structures generally do not allow variation of cell properties within a structure; however, additive manufacturing enables graded lattices to be generated that are potentially more optimal. A method of functionally grading lattices is, therefore, also described to take advantage of this manufacturing capability.},

abstract = {This paper presents a variable damping control strategy to improve trade-off between agility/performance and stability in the control of the ankle exoskeleton robot. Depending on the user's intent of movement, the proposed variable damping controller determines the robotic ankle damping from negative to positive damping values. The range of damping values is determined by incorporating the knowledge of human ankle damping in order to always secure stability of the ankle joint of the coupled human-robot system. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, we performed a set of human experiments with three different robotic damping conditions: fixed positive damping, fixed negative damping, and variable damping. Comparison of the two fixed damping conditions confirmed that there exists a clear trade-off between ankle agility and stability. Further, analysis of the variable damping condition demonstrated that humans could get benefits of not only positive damping to stabilize the ankle but also negative damping to enhance the agility of ankle movement as necessary during dynamic ankle movement. On average, the variable damping condition improved the agility of ankle movement by 76% and stability by 37% compared to the constant positive damping condition and the constant negative damping condition, respectively. Outcomes of this study would allow us to design a robotic controller that significantly improves agility/performance of the human-robot system without compromising its coupled stability. I.},

abstract = {Fabrication of three-dimensional structures has gained increasing importance in the bone tissue engineering (BTE) field. Mechanical properties and permeability are two important requirement for BTE scaffolds. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds are highly dependent on the processing parameters. Layer thickness, delay time between spreading each powder layer, and printing orientation are the major factors that determine the porosity and compression strength of the 3D printed scaffold. In this study, the aggregated artificial neural network (AANN) was used to investigate the simultaneous effects of layer thickness, delay time between spreading each layer, and print orientation of porous structures on the compressive strength and porosity of scaffolds. Two optimization methods were applied to obtain the optimal 3D parameter settings for printing tiny porous structures as a real BTE problem. First, particle swarm optimization algorithm was implemented to obtain the optimum topology of the AANN. Then, Pareto front optimization was used to determine the optimal setting parameters for the fabrication of the scaffolds with required compressive strength and porosity. The results indicate the acceptable potential of the evolutionary strategies for the controlling and optimization of the 3DP process as a complicated engineering problem.},

abstract = {We present the design and evaluation of a multi-articular soft exosuit that is portable, fully autonomous, and provides assistive torques to the wearer at the ankle and hip during walking. Traditional rigid exoskeletons can be challenging to perfectly align with a wearer's biological joints and can have large inertias, which can lead to the wearer altering their natural motion patterns. Exosuits, in comparison, use textiles to create tensile forces over the body in parallel with the muscles, enabling them to be light and not restrict the wearer's kinematics. We describe the biologically inspired design and function of our exosuit, including a simplified model of the suit's architecture and its interaction with the body. A key feature of the exosuit is that it can generate forces passively due to the body's motion, similar to the body's ligaments and tendons. These passively generated forces can be supplemented by actively contracting Bowden cables using geared electric motors, to create peak forces in the suit of up to 200-N. We define the suit-human series stiffness as an important parameter in the design of the exosuit and measure it on several subjects, and we perform human subjects testing to determine the biomechanical and physiological effects of the suit. Results from a five-subject study showed a minimal effect on gait kinematics and an average best-case metabolic reduction of 6.4%, comparing suit worn unpowered versus powered, during loaded walking with 34.6-kg of carried mass including the exosuit and actuators (2.0-kg on both legs, 10.1-kg total).},

abstract = {Prior research in biology and mechanics has shown the importance of hierarchy to the performance of dry adhesive systems on rough surfaces. The gecko utilizes several levels of hierarchy that operate on length scales from millimeters to 100s of nanometers in order to maneuver on smooth and rough vertical surfaces ranging from glass to rock. The gecko's hierarchical system serves two main purposes: it permits conformation to the surface for a large effective area of contact, and it distributes the load evenly among contacting elements. We present a new two-tiered directional adhesive system that provides these capabilities for a gecko-inspired climbing robot. The distal features consist of wedge-shaped structures with a base width of 50 mum and a height of approximately 180 mum. The wedges are mounted atop angled cylindrical features, 380 mum in diameter by approximately 1 mm long. Together, the proximal and distal features bend preferentially in the direction of inclination when loaded with a tangential force, achieving a combination of directional adhesion and conformation to rough surfaces. Using this system, a four legged robot that was previously restricted to climbing smooth surfaces is able to climb vertical surfaces such as a wood panels, painted metals, and plastics. On rougher surfaces, the two-tiered system improves adhesion by a factor of five compared to the wedge features alone. The hierarchical system also improved alignment and performance for large patch sizes.},

abstract = {The capability of grasping and lifting an object in a suitable, stable and controlled way is an outstanding feature for a robot, and thus far, one of the major problems to be solved in robotics. No robotic tools able to perform an advanced control of the grasp as, for instance, the human hand does, have been demonstrated to date. Due to its capital importance in science and in many applications, namely from biomedics to manufacturing, the issue has been matter of deep scientific investigations in both the field of neurophysiology and robotics. While the former is contributing with a profound understanding of the dynamics of real-time control of the slippage and grasp force in the human hand, the latter tries more and more to reproduce, or take inspiration by, the nature's approach, by means of hardware and software technology. On this regard, one of the major constraints robotics has to overcome is the real-time processing of a large amounts of data generated by the tactile sensors while grasping, which poses serious problems to the available computational power. In this paper a bio-inspired approach to tactile data processing has been followed in order to design and test a hardware-software robotic architecture that works on the parallel processing of a large amount of tactile sensing signals. The working principle of the architecture bases on the cellular nonlinear/neural network (CNN) paradigm, while using both hand shape and spatial-temporal features obtained from an array of microfabricated force sensors, in order to control the sensory-motor coordination of the robotic system. Prototypical grasping tasks were selected to measure the system performances applied to a computer-interfaced robotic hand. Successful grasps of several objects, completely unknown to the robot, e.g. soft and deformable objects like plastic bottles, soft balls, and Japanese tofu, have been demonstrated.},

abstract = {Many methods have been proposed for the simulation of constrained mechanical systems. The most obvious of these have mild instabilities and drift problems. Consequently, stabilization techniques have been proposed. A popular stabilization method is Baumgarte's technique, but the choice of parameters to make it robust has been unclear in practice. Some of the simulation methods that have been proposed and used in computations are reviewed here, from a stability point of view. This involves concepts of differential-algebraic equation (DAE) and ordinary differential equation (ODE) invariants. An explanation of the difficulties that may be encountered using Baumgarte's method is given, and a discussion of why a further quest for better parameter values for this method will always remain frustrating is presented. It is then shown how Baumgarte's method can be improved. An efficient stabilization technique is proposed, which may employ explicit ODE solvers in case of nonstiff or highly oscillatory problems and which relates to coordinate projection methods. Examples of a two-link planar robotic arm and a squeezing mechanism illustrate the effectiveness of this new stabilization method.},

@book{astrom2010feedback,
abstract = {This book provides an introduction to the basic principles and tools for the design and analysis of feedback systems. It is intended to serve a diverse audience of scientists and engineers who are interested in understanding and utilizing feedback in physical, biological, information and social systems.We have attempted to keep the mathematical prerequisites to a minimum while being careful not to sacrifice rigor in the process. We have also attempted to make use of examples from a variety of disciplines, illustrating the generality of many of the tools while at the same time showing how they can be applied in specific application domains. A major goal of this book is to present a concise and insightful view of the current knowledge in feedback and control systems. The field of control started by teaching everything that was known at the time and, as new knowledge was acquired, additional courses were developed to cover new techniques. A consequence of this evolution is that introductory courses have remained the same for many years, and it is often necessary to take many individual courses in order to obtain a good perspective on the field. In developing this book, we have attempted to condense the current knowledge by emphasizing fundamental concepts. We believe that it is important to understand why feedback is useful, to know the language and basic mathematics of control and to grasp the key paradigms that have been developed over the past half century. It is also important to be able to solve simple feedback problems using back-of-the-envelope techniques, to recognize fundamental limitations and difficult control problems and to have a feel for available design methods. This book was originally developed for use in an experimental course at Caltech involving students from a wide set of backgrounds. The course was offered to undergraduates at the junior and senior levels in traditional engineering disciplines, as well as first- and second-year graduate students in engineering and science. This latter group included graduate students in biology, computer science and physics. Over the course of several years, the text has been classroom tested at Caltech and at Lund University, and the feedback from many students and colleagues has been incorporated to help improve the readability and accessibility of the material. Because of its intended audience, this book is organized in a slightly unusual fashion compared to many other books on feedback and control. In particular, we introduce a number of concepts in the text that are normally reserved for second-year courses on control and hence often not available to students who are not control systems majors. This has been done at the expense of certain traditional topics, which we felt that the astute student could learn independently and are often explored through the exercises. Examples of topics that we have included are nonlinear dynamics, Lyapunov stability analysis, the matrix exponential, reachability and observability, and fundamental limits of performance and robustness. Topics that we have deemphasized include root locus techniques, lead/lag compensation and detailed rules for generating Bode and Nyquist plots by hand. Several features of the book are designed to facilitate its dual function as a basic engineering text and as an introduction for researchers in natural, information and social sciences. The bulk of the material is intended to be used regardless of the audience and covers the core principles and tools in the analysis and design of feedback systems. Advanced sections, marked by the {\^{a}}€{\oe}dangerous bend{\^{a}}€� symbol shown here, contain material that requires a slightly more technical background, of the sort that would be expected of senior undergraduates in engineering. A few sections are marked by two dangerous bend symbols and are intended for readers with more specialized backgrounds, identified at the beginning of the section. To limit the length of the text, several standard results and extensions are given in the exercises, with appropriate hints toward their solutions. To further augment the printed material contained here, a companion web site has been developed and is available from the publisher{\^{a}}€™s web page: http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8701.html The web site contains a database of frequently asked questions, supplemental examples and exercises, and lecture material for courses based on this text. The material is organized by chapter and includes a summary of the major points in the text as well as links to external resources. The web site also contains the source code for many examples in the book, as well as utilities to implement the techniques described in the text. Most of the code was originally written using MATLAB M-files but was also tested with LabView MathScript to ensure compatibility with both packages. Many files can also be run using other scripting languages such as Octave, SciLab, SysQuake and Xmath. The first half of the book focuses almost exclusively on state space control systems. We begin in Chapter 2 with a description of modeling of physical, biological and information systems using ordinary differential equations and difference equations. Chapter 3 presents a number of examples in some detail, primarily as a reference for problems that will be used throughout the text. Following this, Chapter 4 looks at the dynamic behavior of models, including definitions of stability and more complicated nonlinear behavior. We provide advanced sections in this chapter on Lyapunov stability analysis because we find that it is useful in a broad array of applications and is frequently a topic that is not introduced until later in one{\^{a}}€™s studies. The remaining three chapters of the first half of the book focus on linear systems, beginning with a description of input/output behavior in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we formally introduce feedback systems by demonstrating how state space control laws can be designed. This is followed in Chapter 7 by material on output feedback and estimators. Chapters 6 and 7 introduce the key concepts of reachability and observability, which give tremendous insight into the choice of actuators and sensors, whether for engineered or natural systems. The second half of the book presents material that is often considered to be from the field of {\^{a}}€{\oe}classical control.{\^{a}}€� This includes the transfer function, introduced in Chapter 8, which is a fundamental tool for understanding feedback systems. Using transfer functions, one can begin to analyze the stability of feedback systems using frequency domain analysis, including the ability to reason about the closed loop behavior of a system from its open loop characteristics. This is the subject of Chapter 9, which revolves around the Nyquist stability criterion. In Chapters 10 and 11, we again look at the design problem, focusing first on proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and then on the more general process of loop shaping. PID control is by far the most common design technique in control systems and a useful tool for any student. The chapter on frequency domain design introduces many of the ideas of modern control theory, including the sensitivity function. In Chapter 12, we combine the results from the second half of the book to analyze some of the fundamental trade-offs between robustness and performance. This is also a key chapter illustrating the power of the techniques that have been developed and serving as an introduction for more advanced studies. The book is designed for use in a 10- to 15-week course in feedback systems that provides many of the key concepts needed in a variety of disciplines. For a 10-week course, Chapters 1{\^{a}}€“2, 4{\^{a}}€“6 and 8{\^{a}}€“11 can each be covered in a week{\^{a}}€™s time, with the omission of some topics from the final chapters. A more leisurely course, spread out over 14{\^{a}}€“15 weeks, could cover the entire book, with 2 weeks on modeling (Chapters 2 and 3) {\^{a}}€” particularly for students without much background in ordinary differential equations {\^{a}}€” and 2 weeks on robust performance (Chapter 12). The mathematical prerequisites for the book are modest and in keeping with our goal of providing an introduction that serves a broad audience. We assume familiarity with the basic tools of linear algebra, including matrices, vectors and eigenvalues. These are typically covered in a sophomore-level course on the subject, and the textbooks by Apostol [10], Arnold [13] and Strang [187] can serve as good references. Similarly, we assume basic knowledge of differential equations, including the concepts of homogeneous and particular solutions for linear ordinary differential equations in one variable. Apostol [10] and Boyce and DiPrima [42] cover this material well. Finally, we also make use of complex numbers and functions and, in some of the advanced sections, more detailed concepts in complex variables that are typically covered in a junior-level engineering or physics course in mathematical methods. Apostol [9] or Stewart [186] can be used for the basic material, with Ahlfors [6], Marsden and Hoffman [146] or Saff and Snider [172] being good references for the more advanced material. We have chosen not to include appendices summarizing these various topics since there are a number of good books available. One additional choice that we felt was important was the decision not to rely on a knowledge of Laplace transforms in the book. While their use is by far the most common approach to teaching feedback systems in engineering, many students in the natural and information sciences may lack the necessary mathematical background. Since Laplace transforms are not required in any essential way, we have included them only in an advanced section intended to tie things together for students with that background. Of course, we make tremendous use of transfer functions, which we introduce through the notion of response to exponential inputs,},

KGaA, Weinheim In this paper, the design and manufacturing of a highly sensitive capacitive-based soft pressure sensor for wearable electronics applications are presented. Toward this aim, two types of soft conductive fabrics (knitted and woven), as well as two types of sacrificial particles (sugar granules and salt crystals) to create micropores within the dielectric layer of the capacitive sensor are evaluated, and the combined effects on the sensor's overall performance are assessed. It is found that a combination of the conductive knit electrode and higher dielectric porosity (generated using the larger sugar granules) yields higher sensitivity (121 × 10−4 kPa−1) due to greater compressibility and the formation of air gaps between silicone elastomer and conductive knit electrode among the other design considerations in this study. As a practical demonstration, the capacitive sensor is embedded into a textile glove for grasp motion monitoring during activities of daily living.},

In this paper, a new manufacturing approach is presented to create highly stretchable and soft capacitance-based strain sensors. This involves a rapid surface modification technique based on direct-write laser rastering to create microstructured surfaces on prestrained elastomeric sheets. Then, to impart conductivity, sputtering technology is utilized to deposit aluminum and silver metal layers on the bottom and top surfaces of the elastomer sheet, creating a soft capacitor. During benchtop characterization of the sensors, this study demonstrates that the fabricated electrodes maintain their electrical conductivity up to the 250% strain, and the sensor shows a linear and repeatable output up to 85% strain.

abstract = {Recent advances in laminate manufacturing techniques have driven the development of new classes of millimeter-scale sensorized medical devices, robots capable of terrestrial locomotion and sustained flight, and new techniques for sensing and actuation. Recently, the analysis of laminate micro-devices has focused more manufacturability concerns and not on mechanics. Considering the nature of such devices, we draw from existing research in composites, origami kinematics, and finite element methods in order to identify issues related to sequential assembly and self-folding prior to fabrication as well as the stiffness of composite folded systems during operation. These techniques can be useful for understanding how such devices will bend and flex under normal operating conditions, and when added to new design tools like popupCAD, will give designers another means to develop better devices throughout the design process.},

@article{Autumn2006a,
abstract = {Directional arrays of branched microscopic setae constitute a dry adhesive on the toes of pad-bearing geckos, nature's supreme climbers. Geckos are easily and rapidly able to detach their toes as they climb. There are two known mechanisms of detachment: (1) on the microscale, the seta detaches when the shaft reaches a critical angle with the substrate, and (2) on the macroscale, geckos hyperextend their toes, apparently peeling like tape. This raises the question of how geckos prevent detachment while inverted on the ceiling, where body weight should cause toes to peel and setal angles to increase. Geckos use opposing feet and toes while inverted, possibly to maintain shear forces that prevent detachment of setae or peeling of toes. If detachment occurs by macroscale peeling of toes, the peel angle should monotonically decrease with applied force. In contrast, if adhesive force is limited by microscale detachment of setae at a critical angle, the toe detachment angle should be independent of applied force. We tested the hypothesis that adhesion is increased by shear force in isolated setal arrays and live gecko toes. We also tested the corollary hypotheses that (1) adhesion in toes and arrays is limited as on the microscale by a critical angle, or (2) on the macroscale by adhesive strength as predicted for adhesive tapes. We found that adhesion depended directly on shear force, and was independent of detachment angle. Therefore we reject the hypothesis that gecko toes peel like tape. The linear relation between adhesion and shear force is consistent with a critical angle of release in live gecko toes and isolated setal arrays, and also with our prior observations of single setae. We introduced a new model, frictional adhesion, for gecko pad attachment and compared it to existing models of adhesive contacts. In an analysis of clinging stability of a gecko on an inclined plane each adhesive model predicted a different force control strategy. The frictional adhesion model provides an explanation for the very low detachment forces observed in climbing geckos that does not depend on toe peeling.},

abstract = {Geckos with adhesive toe pads rapidly climb even smooth vertical surfaces. We challenged geckos (Hemidactylus garnotii) to climb up a smooth vertical track that contained a force platform. Geckos climbed vertically at up to 77 cm s(-1) with a stride frequency of 15 Hz using a trotting gait. During each step, whole body fore-aft, lateral and normal forces all decreased to zero when the animal attached or detached its toe pads. Peak fore-aft force was twice body weight at mid-step. Geckos climbed at a constant average velocity without generating decelerating forces on their center of mass in the direction of motion. Although mass-specific mechanical power to climb was ten times the value expected for level running, the total mechanical energy of climbing was only 5-11% greater than the potential energy change. Fore- and hindlegs both pulled toward the midline, possibly loading the attachment mechanisms. Attachment and detachment of feet occupied 13% and 37% of stance time, respectively. As climbing speed increased, the absolute time required to attach and detach did not decrease, suggesting that the period of fore-aft force production might be constrained. During ascent, the forelegs pulled toward, while hindlegs pushed away from the vertical surface, generating a net pitching moment toward the surface to counterbalance pitch-back away from the surface. Differential leg function appears essential for effective vertical as well as horizontal locomotion.},

abstract = {We review a large multidisciplinary effort to develop a family of autonomous robots capable of rapid, agile maneuvers in and around natural and artificial vertical terrains such as walls, cliffs, caves, trees and rubble. Our robot designs are inspired by (but not direct copies of) biological climbers such as cockroaches, geckos, and squirrels. We are incorporating advanced materials (e.g., synthetic gecko hairs) into these designs and fabricating them using state of the art rapid prototyping techniques (e.g., shape deposition manufacturing) that permit multiple iterations of design and testing with an effective integration path for the novel materials and components. We are developing novel motion control techniques to support dexterous climbing behaviors that are inspired by neuroethological studies of animals and descended from earlier frameworks that have proven analytically tractable and empirically sound. Our near term behavioral targets call for vertical climbing on soft (e.g., bark) or rough surfaces and for ascents on smooth, hard steep inclines (e.g., 60 degree slopes on metal or glass sheets) at one body length per second.},

Previous analysis has concentrated on the geometry of the composite material links for creating rigid links.

abstract = {A novel modular variable stiffness actuator (VSA), for use in the knee joint of lower limb exoskeletons, is presented. The actuator consists of a combination of a spindle-driven MACCEPA (Mechanically Adjustable Compliance and Controllable Equilibrium Position Actuator) and a spring acting in parallel, (dis)engaged by means of a simple on/off mechanism depending on the phase of the gait cycle. Such design approach is inspired by two clearly distinctive gait phases of a knee joint, one with a high velocity and low torque, and another one with low velocity and high torque profiles. By tackling each of these two phases separately, energy consumption and torque requirements of an active part of the actuator have been decreased, while keeping the size and the weight of the actuator at a reasonable size for use in wearable robots (WR).},

abstract = {Spinning tops and yo-yos have long fascinated cultures around the world with their unexpected, graceful motions that seemingly elude gravity. Yet, due to the exceeding difficulty of creating stably spinning objects of asymmetric shape in a manual trial-and-error process, there has been little departure from rotationally symmetric designs. With modern 3D printing technologies, however, we can manufacture shapes of almost unbounded complexity at the press of a button, shifting this design complexity toward computation. In this article, we describe an algorithm to generate designs for spinning objects by optimizing their mass distribution: as input, the user provides a solid 3D model and a desired axis of rotation. Our approach then modifies the interior mass distribution such that the principal directions of the moment of inertia align with the target rotation frame. To create voids inside the model, we represent its volume with an adaptive multiresolution voxelization and optimize the discrete voxel fill values using a continuous, nonlinear formulation. We further optimize for rotational stability by maximizing the dominant principal moment. Our method is well-suited for a variety of 3D printed models, ranging from characters to abstract shapes. We demonstrate tops and yo-yos that spin surprisingly stably despite their asymmetric appearance.},

To imitate human arms, the recognition of muscle stiffness and the reflection of the motion are very important. In this paper, the upper limb of the wearer is bandaged with the pneumatic muscle stiffness sensor (MSS), and the wearer's intention is estimated by recognizing the movement of the muscle. In addition, a variable stiffness actuator (VSA) is used to imitate the predicted motion of the wearer and simultaneously to unburden the weight by increasing its stiffness. It is shown that the proposed system is capable of distinguishing between the wearer's intention and the external load. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Baker1997,
abstract = {1. Recordings were made of local field potential (slow waves) and pyramidal tract neurone (PTN) discharge from pairs of sites separated by a horizontal distance of up to 1.5 mm in the primary motor cortex of two conscious macaque monkeys performing a precision grip task. 2. In both monkeys, the slow wave recordings showed bursts of oscillations in the 20-30 Hz range. Spectral analysis revealed that the oscillations were coherent between the two simultaneously recorded cortical sites. In the monkey from which most data were recorded, the mean frequency of peak coherence was 23.4 Hz. 3. Coherence in this frequency range was also seen between cortical slow wave recordings and rectified EMG of hand and forearm muscles active during the task, and between pairs of rectified EMGs. 4. The dynamics of the coherence were investigated by analysing short, quasi-stationary data segments aligned relative to task performance. This revealed that the 20-30 Hz coherent oscillations were present mainly during the hold phase of the precision grip task. 5. The spikes of identified PTNs were used to compile spike-triggered averages of the slow wave recordings. Oscillations were seen in 11/17 averages of the slow wave recorded on the same electrode as the triggering spike, and 11/17 averages of the slow wave recorded on the distant electrode. The mean period of these oscillations was 45.8 ms. 6. It is concluded that oscillations in the range 20-30 Hz are present in monkey motor cortex, are coherent between spatially separated cortical sites, and encompass the pyramidal tract output neurones. They are discernable in the EMG of active muscles, and show a consistent task-dependent modulation.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the temporal relationship between hand stiffness and task performance during adaptation to a brief contact task that required precision at the time of contact. The experiment required subjects to control the vertical position of a paddle on a computer display by grasping a robot's instrumented handle, with the goal of intercepting a virtual ball within 1 mm from the paddle center. A force transient was applied to the hand immediately after the ball-paddle impact to estimate the intrinsic hand impedance. There were two main results: 1) more trials were required for a brief contact task to find a low-energy strategy when compared with tasks that received feedback through the entire movement trajectory and 2) when the whole course of adaptation is long for brief contact tasks, viscoelastic forces were increased to achieve the task goal before the energy reduction initiated. Also, as the accuracy requirement was increased by changing the gain between handle and paddle motion through visual amplification, peak stiffness increased and occurred later, indicating that higher energy strategies are used for longer when the task's accuracy requirements were increased. These results indicated that task performance may be prioritized over energy reduction for a brief contact task.},

abstract = {Stony reefs in shallow water support abundant and species-rich animal communities, and may thus attract top predators such as the harbour porpoise. In summer 2008, the nature res- toration project Blue Reef re-established 45000 m2 of cavernous stony reef at L{\ae}s{\o} Trindel in the northern Kattegat, Denmark. To investigate whether the re-established reef attracts harbour por- poises, the acoustic activity of porpoises was monitored by static acoustic data loggers, T-PODs, before and after the restoration project. T-PODs were placed at the L{\ae}s{\o} Trindel reef and at a ref- erence station 10 km away between June and August from 2006 to 2012. Results showed that por- poise activity increased significantly at L{\ae}s{\o} Trindel reef after the reconstruction in 2008. The number of minutes with porpoise recordings (PPM) increased on average from 9.5 PPM per day in 2006 to a maximum in 2010 (15.2 PPM per day) followed by a small decrease (12.75 PPM per day in 2012). An increase in mean encounter duration from 3.0 min in 2006 to 4.7 min in 2010 (3.7 min in 2012) showed that porpoises not only appeared more often, but also stayed longer at L{\ae}s{\o} Trindel. Furthermore, there was a striking diel pattern in porpoise activity at L{\ae}s{\o} Trindel, with significantly higher activity during the night. This pattern became increasingly apparent over the study period. At the reference station, in contrast, most activity took place during the day through- out the study. The results suggest that these changes reflect a new food source which occurs at night on the re-established stony reef and is exploited by the porpoises.},

abstract = {Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated figures are based exclusively on reduced-coordinate formulations. This pa- per describes a general, non-iterative linear-time simulationmethod based instead on Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange multiplier meth- ods are important for computer graphics applications because they bypass the difficult (and often intractable) problem of parameter- izing a systems degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality constraints acting between pairs of bodies, the method takes O(n) time to compute the systems dynamics. The method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no assumptions about the con- straints topology are needed. Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can be of various dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate ap- proaches, nonholonomic (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional constraints which induce loops and/or handle inequalities can be accommodated with cost O(kn). Thismakes it practical to simulate complicated, closed- loop articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at interactive rates. A complete description of a sample implementation is pro- vided in pseudocode.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Barasuol, Villarreal-Magana, Sangiah, Frigerio, Baker, Morgan, Medrano-Cerda, Caldwell and Semini. Hydraulic actuation is the most widely used alternative to electric motors for legged robots and manipulators. It is often selected for its high power density, robustness and high-bandwidth control performance that allows the implementation of force/impedance control. Force control is crucial for robots that are in contact with the environment, since it enables the implementation of active impedance and whole body control that can lead to a better performance in known and unknown environments. This paper presents the hydraulic Integrated Smart Actuator (ISA) developed by Moog in collaboration with IIT, as well as smart manifolds for rotary hydraulic actuators. The ISA consists of an additive-manufactured body containing a hydraulic cylinder, servo valve, pressure/position/load/temperature sensing, overload protection and electronics for control and communication. The ISA v2 and ISA v5 have been specifically designed to fit into the legs of IIT's hydraulic quadruped robots HyQ and HyQ-REAL, respectively. The key features of these components tackle 3 of today's main challenges of hydraulic actuation for legged robots through: (1) built-in controllers running inside integrated electronics for high-performance control, (2) low-leakage servo valves for reduced energy losses, and (3) compactness thanks to metal additive manufacturing. The main contributions of this paper are the derivation of the representative dynamic models of these highly integrated hydraulic servo actuators, a control architecture that allows for high-bandwidth force control and their experimental validation with application-specific trajectories and tests. We believe that this is the first work that presents additive-manufactured, highly integrated hydraulic smart actuators for robotics.},

abstract = {The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains the points. This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quick- hull Algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and Delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it uses less memory. Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

abstract = {[Biomimetics, review, robotics, electroactive polymers (EAP), actuators, artificial mascle]Humans throughout history have always sought to mimic the appearance, mobility, functionality, intelligent operation, and thinking process of biological creatures. This field of biologically inspired technology, having the moniker biomimetics, has evolved from making static copies of human and animals in the form of statues to the emergence of robots that operate with realistic behavior. Imagine a person walking towards you where suddenly you notice something weird about him – he is not real but rather he is a robot. Your reaction would probably be “I can't believable it but this robot looks very real” just as you would react to an artificial flower that is a good imitation. You may even proceed and touch the robot to check if your assessment is correct but, as oppose to the flower case, the robot may be programmed to respond physical and verbally. This science fiction scenario could become a reality as the current trend continues in developing biologically inspired technologies. Technology evolution led to such fields as artificial muscles, artificial intelligence, and artificial vision as well as biomimetic capabilities in materials science, mechanics, electronics, computing science, information technology and many others. This paper will review the state of the art and challenges to biologically-inspired technologies and the role that EAP is expected to play as the technology evolves.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel underactuated anthropomorphic gripper for prosthetic applications. In order to extend the grasping capabilities of underactuated prosthetic grippers and improve the force transmission ratio, a mechanical lever is mounted inside the palm that allows a proper distribution of the forces and provides mechanical advantage. A static model is developed and the possibilities offered by the lever transmission are investigated. Also, a compact mechanism is introduced to synchronize the motion of the four fingers. Additionally, a mechanical selector is designed that functions as a means of mechanically programming the motion of the fingers by selectively blocking their closing motion. Finally, a prototype, including all the above features, is described and experimental validation is briefly reported.},

abstract = {A voxel-based shape representation when integrated with an evolutionary algorithm offers a number of potential advantages for shape optimization. Topology need not be predefined, geometric constraints are easily imposed and, with adequate resolution, any shape can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy. However, lack of boundary smoothness, length of chromosome, and inclusion of small holes in the final shape have been stated as problems with this representation. This paper describes two experiments performed in an attempt to address some of these problems. First, a design problem with only a small computational cost of evaluating candidate shapes was used as a testbed for designing genetic operators for this shape representation. Second, these operators were refined for a design problem using a more costly finite element evaluation. It was concluded that the voxel representation can, with careful design of genetic operators, be useful in shape optimization.},

However, key challenges in the design and manufacture of soft robots include the complex fabrication processes and the interfacing of soft and rigid components. We used multimaterial three-dimensional (3D) printing to manufacture a combustion-powered robot whose body transitions from a rigid core to a soft exterior. This stiffness gradient, spanning three orders of magnitude in modulus, enables reliable interfacing between rigid driving components (controller, battery, etc.) and the primarily soft body, and also enhances performance. Powered by the combustion of butane and oxygen, this robot is able to perform untethered jumping.},

@article{Bass2015,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {When a given system of differential equations is integrated by numerical and automatic integration it may occur that the solution at hand satisfies an analytical relation which is a corollary of the differential equations but which is unknown to the automatic computer. An example of such a relation is the energy relation in conservative systems or the analytical relation generated by an outer holonomic or non-holonomic constraint provided the Lagrange equations of the first kind are used. It is shown that, in general, the computed numerical values of the solution satisfy such analytic relations with poor accuracy. The aim of the paper is to show how the analytical relations can be satisfied in a stabilized manner in order to improve the numerical accuracy of the solution of the differential equations. The proposed method leads to a modified differential system which is often stable in the sense of Ljapunov, whereas the original system is unstable.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for the integration of the equations\nof motion of constrained multibody systems in descriptor form. The\nmethod is based on the penalty-Augmented Lagrangian formulation and\nuses mass-orthogonal projections for the solution to satisfy the\nkinematic constraint conditions. The number of equations being solved\nis equal to the number of states, and does not depend on the number\nof constraint conditions. Therefore, the method is particularly suitable\nfor systems with redundant constraints, singular configurations or\ntopology changes. The major advantage of the new method relies on\nthe fact that for a low computational cost, the constraints in positions,\nvelocities and accelerations are satisfied to machine precision during\nthe numerical integration. This process is efficiently done by means\nof a mass-orthogonal projection without the need for coordinate partitioning\nor reduction to a minimum set of coordinates. The projection scheme\nallows for a more accurate and robust integration of the equations\nof motion since constraint violations constitute one of the primary\nsources of numerical errors and instabilities during the integration\nprocess. The proposed projection is also applied to the classical\nLagrangian approach, thus eliminating the need for further stabilization\nas well as the selection of parameters in Baumgarte's method.},

@article{Beck1999,
abstract = {Kent Beck's eXtreme Programming eXplained provides an intriguing high-level overview of the author's Extreme Programming (XP) software development methodology. Written for IS managers, project leaders, or programmers, this guide provides a glimpse at the principles behind XP and its potential advantages for small- to mid-size software development teams. The book intends to describe what XP is, its guiding principles, and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids case studies and concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy of XP. Instead, it demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit testing, programming in pairs, communal ownership of code, and customer input on software to motivate code improvement during the development process. As the author notes, these principles are not new, but when they're combined their synergy fosters a new and arguably better way to build and maintain software. Throughout the book, the author presents and explains these principles, such as "rapid feedback" and "play to win," which form the basis of XP. Generally speaking, XP changes the way programmers work. The book is good at delineating new roles for programmers and managers who Beck calls "coaches." The most striking characteristic of XP is that programmers work in pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic part of the coding process. In a later section, the author even shows where XP works and where it doesn't and offers suggestions for migrating teams and organizations over to the XP process. In the afterword, the author recounts the experiences that led him to develop and refine XP, an insightful section that should inspire any organization to adopt XP. This book serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of XP for the manager or programmer who wants a potentially better way to build software. -Richard Dragan Topics covered: Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology, principles, XP team roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software lifecycle, and adopting XP. Software development projects can be fun, productive, and even daring. Yet they can consistently deliver value to a business and remain under control. Extreme Programming (XP) was conceived and developed to address the specific needs of software development conducted by small teams in the face of vague and changing requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges many conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that the cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically over the course of time. XP recognizes that projects have to work to achieve this reduction in cost and exploit the savings once they have been earned. Fundamentals of XP include: Distinguishing between the decisions to be made by business interests and those to be made by project stakeholders. Writing unit tests before programming and keeping all of the tests running at all times. Integrating and testing the whole system-several times a day. Producing all software in pairs, two programmers at one screen. Starting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves to add needed flexibility and remove unneeded complexity. Putting a minimal system into production quickly and growing it in whatever directions prove most valuable. Why is XP so controversial? Some sacred cows don't make the cut in XP: Don't force team members to specialize and become analysts, architects, programmers, testers, and integrators-every XP programmer participates in all of these critical activities every day. Don't conduct complete up-front analysis and design-an XP project starts with a quick analysis of the entire system, and XP programmers continue to make analysis and design decisions throughout development. Develop infrastructure and frameworks as you develop your application, not up-front-delivering business value is the heartbeat that drives XP projects. Don't write and maintain implementation documentation-communication in XP projects occurs face-to-face, or through efficient tests and carefully written code. You may love XP or you may hate it, but Extreme Programming Explained will force you to take a fresh look at how you develop software.},

Existing work in this area typically adopts a rigid connection between the actuator and the pectoral fins, which requires a faster actuation speed in the power stroke than in the recovery stroke to produce a net thrust or moment. In addition to increasing the control complexity, the latter requirement leads to slow robot speeds due to prolonged deceleration during the recovery stroke. In this paper, we propose the design of a novel flexible passive joint that connects the servomotor arm to the pectoral fin, to overcome the aforementioned problem. A dynamic model is developed for the joint and for a robotic fish equipped with such joints. The design and the model are evaluated with extensive experimental results. With symmetric actuation patterns during the power and recovery strokes, the robotic fish with the proposed joints shows clear speed advantage over the case involving rigid joints and asymmetric actuation. Motivated by the need for design optimization, the model is further utilized to investigate the influence of the joint length and stiffness on the robot locomotion performance and efficiency. It is found that, for low fin-beat frequencies, longer or more flexible joints lead to higher speeds, and the trend is reversed at high fin-beat frequencies. On the other hand, while the mechanical efficiency shows a decreasing trend when the frequency increases, it is higher with shorter joints. These findings suggest the utility of the proposed model for multiobjective design of the joint and its operating frequency.},

abstract = {To engage in cooperative activities with human partners, robots have to possess basic interactive abilities and skills. However, programming such interactive skills is a challenging task, as each interaction partner can have different timing or an alternative way of executing movements. In this paper, we propose to learn interaction skills by observing how two humans engage in a similar task. To this end, we introduce a new representation called Interaction Primitives. Interaction primitives build on the framework of dynamic motor primitives (DMPs) by maintaining a distribution over the parameters of the DMP. With this distribution, we can learn the inherent correlations of cooperative activities which allow us to infer the behavior of the partner and to participate in the cooperation. We will provide algorithms for synchronizing and adapting the behavior of humans and robots during joint physical activities.},

abstract = {Curvature and mechanics are intimately connected for thin materials, and this coupling between geometry and physical properties is readily seen in folded structures from intestinal villi and pollen grains, to wrinkled membranes and programmable metamaterials. While the well-known rules and mechanisms behind folding a flat surface have been used to create deployable structures and shape transformable materials, folding of curved shells is still not fundamentally understood. Curved shells naturally deform by simultaneously bending and stretching, and while this coupling gives them great stability for engineering applications, it makes folding a surface of arbitrary curvature a non-trivial task. Here we discuss the geometry of folding a creased shell, and demonstrate theoretically the conditions under which it may fold continuously. When these conditions are violated we show, using experiments and simulations, that shells undergo rapid snapping motion to fold from one stable configuration to another. Although material asymmetry is a proven mechanism for creating this bifurcation of stability, for the case of a creased shell, the inherent geometry itself serves as a barrier to folding. We discuss here how two fundamental geometric concepts, creases and curvature, combine to allow rapid transitions from one stable state to another. Independent of material system and length scale, the design rule that we introduce here explains how to generate snapping transitions in arbitrary surfaces, thus facilitating the creation of programmable multi-stable materials with fast actuation capabilities.},

This paper presents a methodology for optimal shape design where both these drawbacks can be avoided. The method is related to modern production techniques and consists of computing the optimal distribution in space of an anisotropic material that is constructed by introducing an infimum of periodically distributed small holes in a given homogeneous, isotropic material, with the requirement that the resulting structure can carry the given loads as well as satisfy other design requirements. The computation of effective material properties for the anisotropic material is carried out using the method of homogenization. Computational results are presented and compared with results obtained by boundary variations. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

In such exposition, a critical evaluation of what in the author's view are the leading ideas and emerging trends is privileged with respect to exhaustiveness of citations. The survey is focused mainly on three types of functional requirements a machine hand can be assigned in an artificial system, namely, manipulative dexterity, grasp robustness, and human operability. A basic distinction is made between hands designed for mimicking the human anatomy and physiology,and hands designed to meet restricted, practical requirements. In the latter domain, arguments are presented in favor of a -minimalistic” attitude in the design of hands for practical applications, i.e., use the least number of actuators, the simplest set of sensors, etc., for a given task. To achieve this rather obvious engineering goal is a challenge to our community. The paper illustrates some of the new sometimes difficult, problems that are brought about by building and controlling simpler, more practical devices},

abstract = {We report on recent work in modelling the process of grasping and active touch by natural and artificial hands. Starting from observations made in human hands about the correlation of degrees of freedom in patterns of more frequent use (postural synergies), we consider the implications of a geometrical model accounting for such data, which is applicable to the pre-grasping phase occurring when shaping the hand before actual contact with the grasped object. To extend applicability of the synergy model to study force distribution in the actual grasp, we introduce a modified model including the mechanical compliance of the hand's musculotendinous system. Numerical results obtained by this model indicate that the same principal synergies observed from pre-grasp postural data are also fundamental in achieving proper grasp force distribution. To illustrate the concept of synergies in the dual domain of haptic sensing, we provide a review of models of how the complexity and heterogeneity of sensory information from touch can be harnessed in simplified, tractable abstractions. These abstractions are amenable to fast processing to enable quick reflexes as well as elaboration of high-level percepts. Applications of the synergy model to the design and control of artificial hands and tactile sensors are illustrated.},

abstract = {The scaling of bone and muscle geometry in mammals suggests that peak stresses (ratio of force to cross-sectional area) acting in these two support elements increase with increasing body size. Observations of stresses acting in the limb bones of different sized mammals during strenuous activity, however, indicate that peak bone stress is independent of size (maintaining a safety factor of between 2 and 4). It appears that similar peak bone stresses and muscle stresses in large and small mammals are achieved primarily by a size-dependent change in locomotor limb posture: small animals run with crouched postures, whereas larger species run more upright. By adopting an upright posture, large animals align their limbs more closely with the ground reaction force, substantially reducing the forces that their muscles must exert (proportional to body mass) and hence, the forces that their bones must resist, to counteract joint moments. This change in limb posture to maintain locomotor stresses within safe limits, however, likely limits the maneuverability and accelerative capability of large animals.},

abstract = {Mammalian skeletons experience peak locomotor stresses (force per area) that are 25 to 50% of their failure strength, indicating a safety factor of between two and four. The mechanism by which animals achieve a constant safety factor varies depending on the size of the animal. Over much of their size (0.1 to 300 kilograms), larger mammals maintain uniform skeletal stress primarily by having a more upright posture, which decreases mass-specific muscle force by increasing muscle mechanical advantage. At greater sizes, increased skeletal allometry and decreased locomotor performance likely maintain stresses constant. At smaller sizes, skeletal stiffness may be more critical than strength. The decrease in mass-specific muscle force in mammals weighing 0.1 to 300 kilogram indicates that peak muscle stresses are also constant and correlates with a decrease in mass-specific energy cost of locomotion. The consistent pattern of locomotor stresses developed in long bones at different speeds and gaits within a species may have important implications for how bones adaptively remodel to changes in stress.},

abstract = {Much of what we know about animal locomotion is derived from studies examining animals moving within a single, homogeneous environment, at a steady speed and along a flat grade. As a result, the issue of how musculoskeletal function might shift to accommodate variability within the external environment has remained relatively unexplored. One possibility is that locomotor muscles are differentially recruited depending upon the environment in which the animal is moving. A second possibility is that the same muscles are recruited, but that they are activated in a different manner so that their contractile function differs according to environment. Finally, it is also possible that, in some cases, animals may not need to alter their musculoskeletal function to move under different external conditions. In this case, however, the mechanical behavior appropriate for one environmental condition may constrain locomotor performance in another. To begin to explore the means by which animals accommodate variable conditions in their environment, we present three case studies examining how musculoskeletal systems function to allow locomotion under variable conditions: (1) eels undulating through water and across land, (2) turkeys running on level and inclined surfaces, and (3) ducks using their limbs to walk and to paddle. In all three of these examples, the mechanical behavior of some muscle(s) involved in locomotion are altered, although to different degrees and in different ways. In the running turkeys, the mechanical function of a major ankle extensor muscle shifts from contracting isometrically on a flat surface (producing little work and power), to shortening actively during contraction on an uphill gradient (increasing the amount of work and power generated). In the ducks, the major ankle extensor undergoes the same general pattern of activation and shortening in water and on land, except that the absolute levels of muscle stress and strain and work output are greater during terrestrial locomotion. In eels, a transition to land elicits changes in electromyographic duty cycles and the relative timing of muscle activation, suggesting some alteration in the functional mechanics of the underlying musculature. Only by studying muscle function in animals moving under more variable conditions can we begin to characterize the functional breadth of the vertebrate musculoskeletal system and understand more fully its evolutionary design.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to localize brain areas active during manipulation of complex objects. In one experiment subjects were required to manipulate complex objects for exploring their macrogeometric features as compared to manipulation of a simple smooth object (a sphere). In a second experiment subjects were asked to manipulate complex objects and to silently name them upon recognition as compared to manipulation of complex not recognizable objects without covert naming. Manipulation of complex objects resulted in an activation of ventral premotor cortex [Brodmann's area (BA) 44], of a region in the intraparietal sulcus (most probably corresponding to the anterior intraparietal area in the monkey), of area SII and of a sector of the superior parietal lobule. When the objects were covertly named additional activations were found in the opercular part of BA 44 and in the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45). We suggest that a fronto-parietal circuit for manipulation of objects exists in humans and involves basically the same areas as in the monkey. It is proposed that area SII analyses the intrinsic object characteristics whilst the superior parietal lobule is related to kinaesthesia.},

abstract = {It has been shown in nonhuman primates that the posterior parietal cortex is involved in coordination of arm and eye movements in space, whereas the anterior intraparietal area in the anterior lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus plays a crucial role in fine finger movements, such as grasping. In this study we show by optoelectronic movement recordings that patients with cortical lesions involving the anterior lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus have selective deficits in the coordination of finger movements required for object grasping, whereas reaching is much less disturbed. Patients with parietal lesions sparing the cortex lining the anterior intraparietal sulcus showed intact grasping behavior. Complementary evidence was obtained from functional MRI in normal control subjects showing a specific activation of the anterior lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus during grasping. In conclusion, this combined lesion and activation study suggests that the anterior lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus, possibly including the human homologue of the anterior intraparietal area, mediates the processing of sensorimotor integration of precisely tuned finger movements in humans.},

abstract = {DASH is a small, lightweight, power autonomous robot capable of running at speeds up to 15 body lengths per second (see video). Drawing inspiration from biomechanics, DASH has a sprawled posture and uses an alternating tripod gait to achieve dynamic open-loop horizontal locomotion. The kinematic design which uses only a single drive motor and allows for a high power density is presented. The design is implemented using a scaled Smart Composite Manufacturing (SCM) process. Evidence is given that DASH runs with a gait that can be characterized using the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. In addition to being fast, DASH is also well suited to surviving falls from large heights, due to the uniquely compliant nature of its structure.},

A gecko-inspired adhesive is mounted with an elastomer tendon and polymer loop to a remote-center-of-motion ankle that allows rapid engagement with the surface and minimizes peeling moments on the adhesive. The maximum velocity possible while climbing decreases as the incline gets closer to vertical, with the robot able to achieve speeds of 10 cm second-1 at a 70-degree incline. A model is implemented to describe the effect of incline angle on climbing speed and, together with high-speed video evidence, reveals that climbing velocity is limited by robot dynamics and adhesive properties and not by power.},

abstract = {Cursorial ground birds are paragons of bipedal running that span a 500-fold mass range from quail to ostrich. Here we investigate the task-level control priorities of cursorial birds by analysing how they negotiate single-step obstacles that create a conflict between body stability (attenuating deviations in body motion) and consistent leg force-length dynamics (for economy and leg safety). We also test the hypothesis that control priorities shift between body stability and leg safety with increasing body size, reflecting use of active control to overcome size-related challenges. Weight-support demands lead to a shift towards straighter legs and stiffer steady gait with increasing body size, but it remains unknown whether non-steady locomotor priorities diverge with size. We found that all measured species used a consistent obstacle negotiation strategy, involving unsteady body dynamics to minimise fluctuations in leg posture and loading across multiple steps, not directly prioritising body stability. Peak leg forces remained remarkably consistent across obstacle terrain, within 0.35 body weights of level running for obstacle heights from 0.1 to 0.5 times leg length. All species used similar stance leg actuation patterns, involving asymmetric force-length trajectories and posture-dependent actuation to add or remove energy depending on landing conditions. We present a simple stance leg model that explains key features of avian bipedal locomotion, and suggests economy as a key priority on both level and uneven terrain. We suggest that running ground birds target the closely coupled priorities of economy and leg safety as the direct imperatives of control, with adequate stability achieved through appropriately tuned intrinsic dynamics.},

abstract = {We propose a universal approach to the problem of computer modeling of shapes with continuously varying material properties satisfying prescribed material conditions on a finite collection of material features and global constraints. The central notion is a parameterization of space by distances from the material features - either exactly or approximately. Functions of such distances provide a systematic and intuitive means for modeling of desired material distributions as they arise in design, manufacturing, analysis and optimization of components with varying material properties. The proposed framework subsumes and generalizes a number of earlier proposals for heterogeneous material modeling. It is theoretically complete in the sense that it allows representation of all material property functions. We demonstrate that the approach can be implemented within the existing framework of solid modeling and its numerous advantages, including: precise and intuitive control using explicit, analytic, differential, and integral constraints specified on the native geometry; guaranteed smoothness and analytic properties without meshing; and applicability to material features of arbitrary dimension, shape, and topology. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Blickhan1989,
abstract = {A simple spring-mass model consisting of a massless spring attached to a point mass describes the interdependency of mechanical parameters characterizing running and hopping of humans as a function of speed. The bouncing mechanism itself results in a confinement of the free parameter space where solutions can be found. In particular, bouncing frequency and vertical displacement are closely related. Only a few parameters, such as the vector of the specific landing velocity and the specific leg length, are sufficient to determine the point of operation of the system. There are more physiological constraints than independent parameters. As constraints limit the parameter space where hopping is possible, they must be tuned to each other in order to allow for hopping at all. Within the range of physiologically possible hopping frequencies, a human hopper selects a frequency where the largest amount of energy can be delivered and still be stored elastically. During running and hopping animals use flat angles of the landing velocity resulting in maximum contact length. In this situation ground reaction force is proportional to specific contact time and total displacement is proportional to the square of the step duration. Contact time and hopping frequency are not simply determined by the natural frequency of the spring-mass system, but are influenced largely by the vector of the landing velocity. Differences in the aerial phase or in the angle of the landing velocity result in the different kinematic and dynamic patterns observed during running and hopping. Despite these differences, the model predicts the mass specific energy fluctuations of the center of mass per distance to be similar for runners and hoppers and similar to empirical data obtained for animals of various size. {\textcopyright}1989.},

@article{Bloch2005,
abstract = {Nonholonomic systems are, roughly speaking, me- chanical systems with constraints on their veloc- ity that are not derivable from position constraints. They arise, for instance, in mechanical systems that have rolling contact (for example, the rolling of wheels without slipping) or certain kinds of slid- ing contact (such as the sliding of skates). They are a remarkable generalization of classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems in which one allows po- sition constraints only. There are some fascinating differences between nonholonomic systems and classical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian systems. Among other things: non- holonomic systems are nonvariational—they arise from the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle and not from Hamilton's principle; whereas energy is pre- served for nonholonomic systems, momentum is not always preserved for systems with symmetry (i.e., there is nontrivial dynamics associated with the nonholonomic generalization of Noether's theorem); nonholonomic systems are almost Pois- son but not Poisson (i.e., there is a bracket that to- gether with the energy on the phase space defines the motion, but the bracket generally does not sat- isfy the Jacobi identity); and finally, unlike the Hamiltonian setting, volume may not be preserved in the phase space, leading to interesting asymp- totic stability in some cases, despite energy con- servation. The purpose of this article is to engage the reader's interest by highlighting some of these differences along with some current research in the area. There has been some confusion in the liter- ature for quite some time over issues such as the variational character of nonholonomic systems, so it is appropriate that we begin with a brief review of the history of the subject.},

abstract = {Humanoid robots are fascinating from two points of view, firstly their construction and secondly because they lend life to inanimate objects. The combination of biology and robots leads to smoother and compliant movement which is more pleasant for us as people. Biologically inspired robots embody non-rigid movement which are made possible by special joints or actuators which give way and can both actively and passively adapt stiffness in different situations. The following paper deals with the construction of a compliant embodiment of a humanoid robot arm, including a five-finger hand with artificial fluidic muscles. The biologically inspired decentralized control architecture allows small units to be responsible for each main movement task. The first section gives a short introduction as to how bionics engineers think and tries to motivate us to build compliant machines. The second section looks at mechanical aspects, limitations and constraints and furthermore describes a human-like robot arm and hand. Section 3 presents the fluidic muscle actuator of the company FESTOThis project was supported by Dr. Werner Fischer and Univ. Prof. Axel Thallemer, FESTO AG & Co. KG.. The fourth section describes the decentralized control architecture and the electronic components. The last section concludes the paper while looking at further prospects.},

It is shown that the main requirement$\$nof a perching foot is a set of strong opposable toes. The anisodactyl,$\$nsyndactyl, heterodactyl, and zygodactyl arrangements of the toes$\$nfill the requirements of a perching foot. On the other hand, the$\$ntoes of a climbing foot must be arranged to oppose the pull of gravity$\$nand should bear strongly curved claws. The anisodactyl, syndactyl,$\$npamprodactyl, and ectropodactyl foot types comply with the functional$\$ndemands of a climbing foot. A dendrogram showing the foot types$\$nand their evolution is given. It is shown that each arrangement$\$nof the toes evolved in response to a particular function (i.e.,$\$nanisodactyl foot evolved for perching), but once evolved it was$\$nalso suitable for other functions (i.e., running or climbing). 3.$\$nA brief discussion of the principle of multiple pathways of adaptation$\$nor evolution is presented. It is shown that there may be several$\$nmorphologically different answers to the same selection force and$\$nthat the morphological differences between these adaptive answers$\$nare not the result of differences in function but are a result of$\$nphylogenetically different starting points. Furthermore, it is shown$\$nthat one cannot conclude that different structures (i.e., arrangements$\$nof the toes) are non-adaptive just because their morphological differences$\$nare non-adaptive. Examples from the evolution of the perching- and$\$nclimbing-foot types were chosen to illustrate these conclusions"--P.$\$n42-43.},

abstract = {In the present paper, we discuss the numeric integration techniques of the 9-node quadrilateral isoparametric Lagrangian Mindlin shell element. We present the concepts of full, reduced and selective integration schemes from two fundamental standpoints. The first being the well known inherent property of the displacement formulation of linear finite elements, notably the stiffening of the element (also known as shear-locking) when full integration of the stiffness matrix is used, while the second is concerned with reduced integration, where compensating for the previous problem by not accounting fully for certain higher order terms of the integrand the element becomes softer. In this latter case certain spurious zero energy displacement modes (ZEM) are possible to arise leading to unrealistic results, therefore it has to be handled by adding restrictive terms to the stiffness matrix. We conclude, that in case of the element under scrutiny, by selective integration (reduction at the bending shear terms) one ZEM occurs, which propagates through the whole mesh, while the full integration stiffens the element only by less than 6%, therefore we recommend the use of the 3x3 full integration scheme.},

abstract = {\nBackground\nMany students may not respond strongly to instruction that they do not perceive as engaging. One pedagogical approach to help engage students involves the use of games. Educational games can provide students with a motivating and stimulating environment while providing them with immediate feedback to promote learning.\n\nPurpose\nThis systematic review examines research focused on the implementation of games to teach undergraduate engineering students; it summarizes prevailing features and cites examples from a variety of engineering disciplines.\n\nScope/Method\nThe systematic review was conducted through a detailed search of Science Direct journals and the Scopus, Web of Science, Compendex/Inspec, and ERIC Education Research Abstract databases using terms pertinent to games in engineering education. A total of 191 papers was included after application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After screening those to determine if assessment of student learning outcomes was performed, 62 papers were found suitable for more detailed analysis.\n\nConclusions\nResearch on the implementation of games in undergraduate engineering classrooms has shown that, despite diverse forms of assessment applied, there is a general trend that both student learning and attitudes are improved by game-based activities. However, since only a relatively small subset of the literature demonstrates a systematic, validated approach in assessment, significant opportunities remain for future research.\n},

abstract = {The automation of the land excavation machines can find applications in the excavation of soil in both terrestrial and planetary mining and construction. The automation requires planning at different levels such as task and trajectory pre-planning, and the automatic execution of these pre-planned tasks. In the execution of the pre-planned digging trajectories, the unexpected soil properties along the trajectory rises problems such as excessive ram-forces that may harm the machine, or cannot be applied because of the power limitations. The cognitive force control for the automation of the land excavation is developed to include the dynamics of the excavator arm. The control of the ram forces of the arm is proposed by regulating the digging depth and the trajectory speed. The developed control system is able to track the pre-planned digging trajectories, and if the ram-forces becomes excessive then the trajectory is modified in time and path to control the ram-forces.},

In the context of our research on the social interactions of the zebrafish Danio Rerio, we developed a miniature robotic fish lure for direct underwater interaction with the living fish. This remotely controlled and waterproof device has a total length of 7.5 cm with the same size ratio as zebrafish and is able to beat its tail with different frequencies and amplitudes, while following the group of living animals using a mobile robot moving outside water that is coupled with the robotic lure using magnets. The robotic lure is also equipped with a rechargeable battery and can be used autonomously underwater for experiments of up to 1 h. We performed experiments with the robot moving inside an aquarium with living fish to analyze its impact on the zebrafish behavior. We found that the beating rate of the tail increased the attractiveness of the lure among the zebrafish shoal. We also demonstrated that the lure could influence a collective decision of the zebrafish shoal, the swimming direction, when moving with a constant linear speed inside a circular corridor. This new robotic fish design and the experimental results are promising for the field of fish–robot interaction.},

abstract = {Many animals use thin perches, such as the branches of trees, as locomotory substrates. In this paper, I have reviewed the literature concerned with measurements of locomotory forces made by birds and primates on thin and flexible substrates. Through a knowledge of the locomotory forces exerted by animals when using different substrates, the mechanical cost of their use can be established. We are just beginning to learn about the magnitude and patterns of force production in various branch-using vertebrates, primarily as a result of the development of instrumented perches. Instrumented perches have been designed to measure the forces produced by birds and primates when leaping from rigid and flexible horizontal and flexible vertical perches, and also from instrumented handgrips during brachiation. The development of these techniques for birds and primates allows us to compare the way in which they use perches as locomotory substrates. In both birds and primates, the magnitudes of landing forces are smaller than those during take-off. Two explanations have been proposed; the difference is either a consequence of perch compliance or it is a strategic decision to be cautious of 'new' perches. Leaps from flexible perches may be somewhat inefficient because considerable energy is dissipated in bending the perch, and this energy may remain unrecovered when the animal leaves contact with the perch.},

To increase versatility in robot design, we present robotic skins that can wrap around arbitrary soft bodies to induce the desired motions and deformations. Robotic skins integrate actuation and sensing into a single conformable material and may be leveraged to create a multitude of controllable soft robots with different functions or gaits to accommodate the demands of different environments. We show that attaching the same robotic skin to a soft body in different ways, or to different soft bodies, leads to distinct motions. Further, we show that combining multiple robotic skins enables complex motions and functions. We demonstrate the versatility of this soft robot design approach in a wide range of applications—including manipulation tasks, locomotion, and wearables—using the same two-dimensional (2D) robotic skins reconfigured on the surface of various 3D soft, inanimate objects.},

How do engineering department chairs find out about engineering education innovations? What factors do engineering department chairs cite as important in adoption decisions? DESIGN/METHOD U.S. engineering department chairs were surveyed regarding their awareness and department use of seven engineering education innovations. One hun- dred ninety-seven usable responses are presented primarily as categorical data with Chi square tests where relevant. active pedagogies (the highest). Mechanical and civil engineering had the highest rates, in part due to many design-related innovations in the survey. Few differences by institution type were evident. In the past, word of mouth and presentations were far more effective than publications in alerting depart- ment chairs to the innovations. Department chairs cited financial resources, faculty time and attitudes, and student satisfaction and learning as major con- siderations in adoption decisions. CONCLUSIONS The importance of disciplinary networks was evident during survey adminis- tration and in the results.

abstract = {The 'Embedded Projection Method' (EPM) is an attempt to eliminate most of the difficulties related to the solution of high-index differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), as those typical of the dynamics of constrained systems. The intimate coupling between the algebraic and the differential parts lies at the origin of these difficulties, therefore we uncouple these components, introduce an unconstrained, modified state variable, and complement the resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE) by additional algebraic variables. As a result, a general, consistent index reduction from arbitrarily high values to one is obtained, allowing the use of any suitable ODE integration algorithm, without the need for a specialized DAE solver. The EPM solution is intrinsically endowed with greater accuracy and stability than conventional counterparts, thus balancing the higher complexity of the procedure. We illustrate the EPM including some applications of holonomic and non-holonomic mechanical systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This interpolation of axes movement must satisfy a number of constraints on axes dynamics (velocity, acceleration, and jerk), and on process outcome (smooth tool movement and precise tracking of the nominal tool-path at the desired feed-rate). This paper presents an algorithm for CNC kernels that aims at solving the axes interpolation problem by exploiting an Optimal Control Problem formulation. With respect to other solutions proposed in the literature, the approach presented here takes an original approach by assuming a predefined path tracking tolerance - to be added to the constraints listed above - and calculating the whole trajectory (path and feed-rate profile) that satisfies the given constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is benchmarked against the trajectory generated by an industrial, state-of-the-art CNC, proving a significant advantage in efficiency and smoothness of axes velocity profiles. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Identifying effective tutorial dialogue strategies is a key issue for intelligent tutoring systems research. Human-human tutoring offers a valuable model for identifying effective tutorial strategies, but extracting them is a challenge because of the richness of human dialogue. This article addresses that challenge through a machine learning approach that 1) learns tutorial modes from a corpus of human tutoring, and 2) identifies the statistical relationships between student outcomes and the learned modes. The modeling approach utilizes hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the unobservable stochastic structure that is thought to influence the observations, in this case dialogue acts and task actions, that are generated by task-oriented tutorial dialogue. We refer to this unobservable layer as the hidden dialogue state, and interpret it as representing the tutor and students' collaborative intentions. We have applied HMMs to a corpus of annotated task-oriented tutorial dialogue to learn one model for each of two effective human tutors. Significant correlations emerged between the automatically extracted tutoring modes and student learning outcomes. Broadly, the results suggest that HMMs can learn meaningful hidden tutorial dialogue structure. More specifically, the findings point to specific mechanisms within task-oriented tutorial dialogue that are associated with increased student learning. This work has direct applications in authoring data-driven tutorial dialogue system behavior and in investigating the effectiveness of human tutoring. {\textcopyright} 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

avoid collisions. To better understand this discrepancy, a
collision avoidance algorithm was applied to frames of digitized
video trajectory data from bats, swallows and fish (Myotis
velifer, Petrochelidon pyrrhonota and Danio aequipinnatus).
Information available from visual cues, specifically relative
position and velocity, was provided to the algorithm which used
this information to define collision cones that allowed the
algorithm to find a safe velocity requiring minimal deviation
from the original velocity. The subset of obstacles provided to
the algorithm was determined by the animal's sensing range in
terms of metric and topological distance. The algorithmic
calculated velocities showed good agreement with observed
biological velocities, indicating that the algorithm was an
informative basis for comparison with the three species and could
potentially be improved for engineered applications with further
study.},

@article{Braun2009,
abstract = {By means of the Udwadia-Kalaba approach we propose an explicit equation of constrained motion developed to simulate constrained dynamical systems without error accumulation due to constraint drift. The basic idea is to embed a small virtual force and a small virtual impulse to the equation of motion, in order to avoid the drift typically experienced in constrained multibody simulations. The embedded correction terms are selected to minimally alter the dynamics in an acceleration and kinetic energy norm sense. The formulation allows one to use a standard ODE solver, avoiding the need for iterative constraint stabilization. The equation is based on the pseudoinverse of a constraint matrix such that it can be used under redundant constraints and kinematic singularities. The proposed method takes into account the finite word-length of the computational environment, and also accommodates possibly inconsistent initial conditions. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The dissertation is organized in five chapters. Chapter I presents the introduction of the work. Chapters II-IV contain three manuscripts that summarize the research completed and have been submitted for publication as journal articles. Chapter V concludes the work with the contributions and the proposed future direction. An overview of the manuscripts presented through Chapter II-IV is given as follows: Manuscript 1: D.J. Braun and M. Goldfarb, "Eliminating Constraint Drift in the Numerical Simulation of Constrained Dynamical Systems," Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering , vol. 198 no. 37-40, pp. 3151-3160, 2009. This article provide a theoretical framework for numerical simulation of constrained dynamical system modeled with differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Specifically, the paper offers an equation of constrained motion which, solved with a standard explicit ODE integrator (i.e., Euler, Runge-Kutta method), provides a precise motion prediction for DAEs. Beyond the theoretical contribution, the paper presents three trajectory tracking simulations on a seven link planar anthropometric biped robot which demonstrates feasibility of the approach to simulate bipedal motion subjected to redundant (dependent) constraints. This features have been recognized important through numerical investigation of the walking controller proposed in [25] (Manuscript 2). The real-time implementation of the method was also utilized for parameter identification, free swing experiments, and the PD control experiment performed to characterize the dynamics of the seven link biped, design and control of which is discussed in [26] (Manuscript 3). Manuscript 2: D.J. Braun and M. Goldfarb, "A Control Approach to Actuated Dynamic Walking in Biped Robots," IEEE Transaction on Robotics , 2009 - accepted. A short version of this paper, [27], is presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, October 11-15, 2009, St. Louis, USA. This article presents a control framework for human-like actuated dynamic walking in biped robots. Instead of utilizing the ZMP (zero-moment-point) control philosophy (frequently preferred to synthesize actuated dynamic walking), we propose an alternative control method for human-like dynamic walking. The proposed approach meant to improve, the walking style (bent knee walking) and the low locomotion efficiency recognized as fundamental issues in the majority of actuated walking robots. As was recognized during the conducted research, realization of a compliant walking precludes enforcement of a prespecified reference trajectory, or may also not favor enforcing state dependent kinematic constraints or other attributes of the walking cycle (such as step length, stepping frequency or average forward speed) with high gain control. This recognition motivated us to develop a control framework which utilizes state-dependent control torques generated by low-gain spring-damper couples to provide motion coordination without prespecifying the motion of the system. As is demonstrated (through numerous simulations) in the article, the approach can provide energy-efficient human like actuated dynamic walking in biped robots. Manuscript 3: D.J. Braun, Jason E. Mitchell and M. Goldfarb, "Experimental Implementation of Actuated Dynamic Walking in Biped Robots," The International Journal of Robotics Research - submitted. A short version of this paper, [2], is accepted on the 9th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots December 7-10, 2009, Paris, France. By utilizing the control framework proposed in [25] (Manuscript 2), this article presents an experimental realization of actuated dynamic walking in biped robots. During the development of the walking controller, an important design requirement for energy-efficient realization of dynamic walking have been identified. This requirement depends on joint actuation which should not suppress the passive joint motion (i.e., joints should be backdrivable such as human joints . Practically, utilization of backdrivable joint design allows the inertial motion of the robot to be exploited through walking rather than being suppressed by the actuation units. This recognition motivated us to design a seven link biped robot, with highly backdrivable joints, which device is used in the experimental verification of the control framework. The presented walking experiment demonstrates dynamic walking characterized with (partially) ballistic swing, extended knee stance support and (preemptive) ankle push-off which feature can also be identified during (fast) human walking. Utilizing the framework presented in [28], a control approach for human-like actuated dynamic walking was analytically developed and numerically investigated in [25], which approach is then experimentally verified on a seven link biped robot designed for this purpose [26]. According to the authors best knowledge, the preemptive ankle push-off (which is an important qualitative attribute of a fast human walking) identified during the walking experiments, have been only demonstrated on the MIT Spring Flamingo [18] and on the actuator assisted Cornell dynamic walker [1].},

abstract = {High-speed filming has been used to investigate the performance of the peacock butterfly Inachis io while flying in a wind-tunnel. The wake of the butterfly in 'feeding' flight is a system of discrete pairs of vortex rings: in each pair the vortex rings are coupled at right angles. The flow distribution around the butterfly and the dynamics of the vortex rings suggest that useful force is produced continuously throughout the wingbeat. The butterfly's flapping flight can be divided into three successive stages: during the downstroke, force generation can be explained by quasi-steady aerofoil action; during the upstroke and supination, by unsteady aerofoil action; and during pronation, by a jet mechanism. The study of airflow around the peacock butterfly throws light on the evolutionary changes in the pattern of interaction between insect wings and the air. At the first stage of the evolution of insect flight, documented in a subimago of the mayfly Heptagenia sulphurea and some other primitive insects, flapping wings generate a system of coupled vortex rings; the aerodynamic force, being perpendicular to the stroke plane, coincides with the direction of the longitudinal body axis. At the second stage, this force is directed forwards and upwards relative to the body axis; the vortex wake is the same as that at the first stage. From this point, two paths of evolution are possible. The first leads to the vortex pattern recorded in the peacock butterfly. The second is typically found in higher orders, where the narrow and relatively short wings flap with lower amplitude and higher frequency, leaving in their wake two chains of uncoupled small vortex rings.},

abstract = {Gripping and holding of objects are key tasks for robotic manipulators. The development of universal grippers able to pick up unfamiliar objects of widely varying shape and surface properties remains, however, challenging. Most current designs are based on the multi-fingered hand, but this approach introduces hardware and software complexities. These include large numbers of controllable joints, the need for force sensing if objects are to be handled securely without crushing them, and the computational overhead to decide how much stress each finger should apply and where. Here we demonstrate a completely different approach to a universal gripper. Individual fingers are replaced by a single mass of granular material that, when pressed onto a target object, flows around it and conforms to its shape. Upon application of a vacuum the granular material contracts and hardens quickly to pinch and hold the object without requiring sensory feedback. We find that volume changes of less than 0.5% suffice to grip objects reliably and hold them with forces exceeding many times their weight. We show that the operating principle is the ability of granular materials to transition between an unjammed, deformable state and a jammed state with solid-like rigidity. We delineate three separate mechanisms, friction, suction and interlocking, that contribute to the gripping force. Using a simple model we relate each of them to the mechanical strength of the jammed state. This opens up new possibilities for the design of simple, yet highly adaptive systems that excel at fast gripping of complex objects.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.Full autonomy remains a challenge for miniature robotic platforms due to mass and size requirements of on-board power and control electronics. This paper presents a solution to these challenges with a 2.3g autonomous legged robot. An off-the-shelf optical mouse sensor is adapted for use on the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot (HAMR) by reducing the sensor weight by 36% and achieving a position error below 11% when suspended 3mm above a cardstock surface. The position data is combined with data from a gyroscope for feedback control of both position and orientation. A microcontroller processes the sensor data and commands a controlled gait to HAMR that is powered by a battery, a boost converter and high voltage drive electronics. Solar cells are used as an alternative source providing enough power for autonomous operation of the robot. The resulting deviation for a controlled straight-line walk using both sensors to minimize lateral deviation and angular error is only 4.6%, compared to an error of 31% in an uncontrolled, straight-line walk.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple, data-driven technique for identifying models for the dynamics of legged robots. Piecewise Affine (PWA) models are used to approximate the observed nonlinear system dynamics of a hexapedal millirobot. The high dimension of the state space (16) and very large number of state observations (∼100,000) motivated the use of statistical clustering methods to automatically choose the submodel regions. Comparisons of models with 1 to 50 PWA regions are analyzed with respect to state derivative prediction and forward simulation accuracy. Derivative prediction accuracy was shown to reduce average in-axis absolute error by up to 52% compared to a null estimator. Simulation results show tracking of state trajectories over one stride length, and the degradation of simulation prediction is analyzed across model complexity and time horizon. We describe metrics for comparing the performance of different model complexities across one-step and simulation predictions. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@article{buchli_learning_2011,
abstract = {One of the hallmarks of the performance, versatility, and robustness of biological motor control is the ability to adapt the impedance of the overall biomechanical system to different task requirements and stochastic disturbances. A transfer of this principle to robotics is desirable, for instance to enable robots towork robustly and safely in everyday human environments. It is, however, not trivial to derive variable impedance controllers for practical high degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic tasks. In this contribution, we accomplish such variable impedance control with the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm PI2 (Policy Improvement with Path Integrals). PI2 is a model-free, sampling-based learning method derived from first principles of stochastic optimal control. The PI2 algorithm requires no tuning of algorithmic parameters besides the exploration noise. The designer can thus fully focus on the cost function design to specify the task. From the viewpoint of robotics, a particular useful property of PI2 is that it can scale to problems of many DOFs, so that reinforcement learning on real robotic systems becomes feasible. We sketch the PI2 algorithm and its theoretical properties, and how it is applied to gain scheduling for variable impedance control. We evaluate our approach by presenting results on several simulated and real robots. We consider tasks involving accurate tracking through via points, and manipulation tasks requiring physical contact with the environment. In these tasks, the optimal strategy requires both tuning of a reference trajectory and the impedance of the end-effector. The results show that we can use path integral based reinforcement learning not only for planning but also to derive variable gain feedback controllers in realistic scenarios. Thus, the power of variable impedance control is made available to a wide variety of robotic systems and practical applications},

abstract = {Control of grasp stability under different frictional conditions has primarily been studied in manipulatory tasks involving two digits only. Recently we found that many of the principles for control of forces originally demonstrated for two-digit grasping also apply to various three-digit grasps. Here we examine the control of grasp stability in a multidigit task in which subjects used the tips of the thumb, index, and middle finger to lift an object. The grasp resembled those used when lifting a cylindrical object from above. The digits either all contacted the same surface material or one of the digits contacted a surface material that was more, or less, slippery than that contacted by the other two digits. The three-dimensional forces and torques applied by each digit and the contact positions were measured along with the position and orientation of the object. The distribution of forces among the digits strongly reflected constraints imposed by the geometric relationship between the object's center of mass and the contact surfaces. On top of this distribution, we observed changes in force coordination related to changes in the combination of surface materials. When all digits contacted the same surface material, the ratio between the normal force and tangential load (F(n):L ratio) was similar across digits and scaled to provide an adequate safety margin against slip. With different contact surfaces subjects adapted the F(n):L ratios at the individual digits to the local friction with only small influences by the friction at the other two digits. They accomplished this by scaling the normal forces similarly at all digits and changing the distribution of load among the digits. The surface combination did not, however, influence digit position, tangential torque, or object tilting systematically. The change in load distribution, rather, resulted from interplay between these factors, and the nature of this interplay varied between trials. That is, subjects achieved grasp stability with various combinations of fingertip actions and appeared to exploit the many degrees of freedom offered by the multidigit grasp. The results extend previous findings based on two-digit tasks to multidigit tasks by showing that subjects adjust fingertip forces at each digit to the local friction. Moreover, our findings suggest that subjects adapted the load distribution to the current frictional condition by regulating the normal forces to allow slips to occur early in the lift task, prior to object lift-off.},

Therefore we have developed a multisensory articulated four finger hand, where all actuators are integrated in the hand's palm or the fingers directly. It is an integrated part of a complex light-weight manipulation system aiming at the development of robonauts for space. After a brief description of the hand and it's sensorial equipment the hard- and software architecture is outlined with particular emphasis on flexibility and performance issues. The hand is typically controlled through a data glove for telemanipulation and skill-transfer purposes. Autonomous grasping and manipulation capabilities are currently under development},

abstract = {Arboreal animals negotiate a highly three-dimensional world that is discontinuous on many spatial scales. As the scale of substrate discontinuity increases, many arboreal animals rely on leaping or gliding locomotion between distant supports. In order to successfully move through their habitat, gliding animals must actively modulate both propulsive and aerodynamic forces. Here we examined the take-off and landing kinetics of a free-ranging gliding mammal, the Malayan colugo (Galeopterus variegatus) using a custom-designed three-dimensional accelerometry system. We found that colugos increase the propulsive impulse to affect longer glides. However, we also found that landing forces are negatively associated with glide distance. Landing forces decrease rapidly as glide distance increases from the shortest glides, then level off, suggesting that the ability to reorient the aerodynamic forces prior to landing is an important mechanism to reduce velocity and thus landing forces. This ability to substantially alter the aerodynamic forces acting on the patagial wing in order to reorient the body is a key to the transition between leaping and gliding and allows gliding mammals to travel long distances between trees with reduced risk of injury. Longer glides may increase the access to distributed resources and reduce the exposure to predators in the canopy or on the forest floor.},

abstract = {For their efficient and elegant locomotion, batoid fishes (e.g. the manta ray) have been widely studied in biology, and also taken as a source of inspiration by engineers and roboticists willing to replicate their propulsion mechanism in order to build efficient swimming machines. In this work, a new model of an under-actuated compliant wing is proposed, exhibiting both the oscillatory and undulatory behaviors underlying batoid propulsion mechanism. The proposed model allowed an investigation of the co-evolution of morphology and control, exploiting dynamics emergent from the interaction between the environment and the mechanical properties of the soft materials. Having condensed such aspects in a mathematical model, we studied the adaptability of a batoid-like morphology to different environments. As for biology, our main contribution is an exploration of the parameters linking swimming mechanics, morphology and environment. This can contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors that led various species of the batoid group to phylogenetically adapt to different environments.

abstract = {Advanced actuation methods are needed in legged robots in order to build robust and efficient robotic systems. State of the art robots either consume much more energy than their biological counterparts or are dramatically less mobile. Advanced actuation methods are necessary to achieve both efficiency and mobility. Many highly mobile legged robots are actuated in serial, but serial actuation has many known weaknesses. This research explores a new and promising method of actuation that is a hybrid of serial and parallel actuation. This method is able to draw from the large body of research conducted on parallel manipulators over the last several decades. This research has shown that parallel manipulators can offer many advantages over serial arms including: smaller mobile mass, more rigidity, faster end effector speeds, and large force capacity. All of these advantages are well suited for the requirements of legged robots. In this paper, the authors detail the implementation of this advanced actuation method from conceptualization to the first stages of testing. It details the choice of configuration, which was important, and somewhat counter intuitive. It also walks through the kinematic solutions, showing relatively simple solutions to challenging problems. The goal of the work is to use multiple, small motors in parallel to actuate the hip and the knee. In this way, during the stance phase of gait, multiple motors can be used in parallel to provide a powerful burst for push-off. Our two-link parallel structure allows the motors to cross multiple joints and therefore can be used to actuate several joints at once. In addition, by mounting motors at the base, the inertia of the leg is greatly reduced. Matthew Holgate SpringActive Inc. Tempe, Arizona, USA Thomas G. Sugar Arizona State University Tempe, Arizona, USA Creating a fast, efficient leg structure is the first step in our project. The higher level goal of this research is to create a quadruped robot that is designed for efficient and fast running. The novel leg structure described in this paper will be capable of the types of motions associated with high speed gait. The robot needs to be capable of both high speed motions and high force output, without being excessively heavy. It should also be capable of accurate three dimensional control, and meet certain manipulability criterion. In this paper we show a functional and promising 3D printed leg prototype. This paper will provide a detailed description of this unique approach to actuation. It will also show the solution to the kinematic equations. Finally, as a proof of concept, the leg was moved in a gait pattern over a treadmill.},

abstract = {Maxwell has shown that b bars assembled into a frame having j joints would, in general, be simply stiff if b = 3j-6. Some of Buckminster Fuller's "Tensegrity" structures have fewer bars than are necessary to satisfy Maxwell's rule, and yet are not "mechanisms" as one might expect, but are actually stiff structures. Maxwell anticipates special cases of this sort, and states that their stiffness will "be of a low order". In fact, the conditions under which Maxwell's exceptional cases occur also permit at least one state of "self-stress" in the frame. Linear algebra enables us to find the number of "incipient" modes of low-order stiffness of the frame in terms of the numbers of bars, joints and independent states of self-stress. Self-stress in the frame has the effect of imparting first-order stiffness to the frame, and it seems from experiments that a single state of self-stress can stiffen a large number of modes. It is this factor which Fuller exploits to make satisfactory structures. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {Transforming flat sheets into three-dimensional structures has emerged as an exciting manufacturing paradigm on a broad range of length scales. Among other advantages, this technique permits the use of functionality-inducing planar processes on flat starting materials, which after shape-shifting, result in a unique combination of macro-scale geometry and surface topography. Fabricating arbitrarily complex three-dimensional geometries requires the ability to change the intrinsic curvature of initially flat structures, while simultaneously limiting material distortion to not disturb the surface features. The centuries-old art forms of origami and kirigami could offer elegant solutions, involving only folding and cutting to transform flat papers into complex geometries. Although such techniques are limited by an inherent developability constraint, the rational design of the crease and cut patterns enables the shape-shifting of (nearly) inextensible sheets into geometries with apparent intrinsic curvature. Here, we review recent origami and kirigami techniques that can be used for this purpose, discuss their underlying mechanisms, and create physical models to demonstrate and compare their feasibility. Moreover, we highlight practical aspects that are relevant in the development of advanced materials with these techniques. Finally, we provide an outlook on future applications that could benefit from origami and kirigami to create intrinsically curved surfaces.},

abstract = {Recent research demonstrates the importance of prototyping to support early stage design efforts. There remains a substantial opportunity to provide tools that codify the leap between the logical objectives of the design effort, and an individual's intuitive design and fabrication experience. This study investigates project articles on the open source, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) design repository, Instructables.com. The database contains guides for producing low cost functional prototypes. Many entries in the repository include documentation of the design process along with instructions for fabrication. Through a systematic research methodology, we extract five prototype design and fabrication principles from articles in the database. An online crowdsourced assessment enables inter-rater testing, with multiple parallel raters. This assessment validates presence of the principles in the database. A controlled study was conducted in which one of two groups was exposed to the principles. This study evaluates connectivity, successful adoption of the principles by participants in the experimental group, and resulting design performance effects. Two case studies of prototyping are also provided. Observations indicate that application of the principles positively impacts prototyping outcomes. A potential area for improvement is edge case evaluation, i.e. principles only found in a single extraordinary sample.},

First the fabrication process of a piezoelectric bending actuator comprising a standard unimorph and a rigid extension is described together with the advantages of adding such an extension. Then the convenience of obtaining an embedded piezoelectric sensor by a simple and inexpensive variation of the fabrication process is pointed out. A model for the sensor embedded into a unimorph actuator with rigid extension is derived together with its flat response band limits. Calibration steps are also outlined which allow, despite residual parasitic actuator-sensor coupling, the use of the actuator with the embedded sensor for measuring position and inertial forces when external mechanical structures are driven. An experiment is carried out which validates the model for the actuator/sensor device under desired operating conditions. Preliminary application of the fabricated device to the MFI is also presented where the mechanical power fed into the wing is estimated.},

abstract = {A method to find optimal topology and shape of structures is presented. With the first the optimal distribution of an assigned mass is found using an approach based on homogenisation theory, that seeks in which elements of a meshed domain it is present mass; with the second the discontinuous boundaries are smoothed. The problem of the optimal topology search has an ON/OFF nature and has suggested the employment of genetic algorithms. Thus in this paper a genetic algorithm has been developed, which uses as design variables, in the topology optimisation, the relative densities (with respect to effective material density) 0 or 1 of each element of the structure and, in the shape one, the coordinates of the keypoints of changeable boundaries constituted by curves. In both the steps the aim is that to find the variable sets producing the maximum stiffness of the structure, respecting an upper limit on the employed mass. The structural evaluations are carried out with a FEM commercial code, linked to the algorithm. Some applications have been performed and results compared with solutions reported in literature. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Reaching and grasping in primates depend on the coordination of neural activity in large frontoparietal ensembles. Here we demonstrate that primates can learn to reach and grasp virtual objects by controlling a robot arm through a closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMIc) that uses multiple mathematical models to extract several motor parameters (i.e., hand position, velocity, gripping force, and the EMGs of multiple arm muscles) from the electrical activity of frontoparietal neuronal ensembles. As single neurons typically contribute to the encoding of several motor parameters, we observed that high BMIc accuracy required recording from large neuronal ensembles. Continuous BMIc operation by monkeys led to significant improvements in both model predictions and behavioral performance. Using visual feedback, monkeys succeeded in producing robot reach-and-grasp movements even when their arms did not move. Learning to operate the BMIc was paralleled by functional reorganization in multiple cortical areas, suggesting that the dynamic properties of the BMIc were incorporated into motor and sensory cortical representations.},

This paper focuses on an innovative approach for the design of a myoelectric prosthetic hand. The new prosthesis features underactuated mechanisms in order to achieve a natural grasping behavior and a good distribution of pinching forces. In this paper it is shown that underactuation allows reproducing most of the grasping behaviors of the human hand, without augmenting the mechanical and control complexity.},

abstract = {Abstract  Strong motivation for developing new prosthetic hand devices is provided by the fact that low functionality and controllability—in  addition to poor cosmetic appearance—are the most important reasons why amputees do not regularly use their prosthetic hands.  This paper presents the design of the CyberHand, a cybernetic anthropomorphic hand intended to provide amputees with functional  hand replacement. Its design was bio-inspired in terms of its modular architecture, its physical appearance, kinematics, sensorization,  and actuation, and its multilevel control system. Its underactuated mechanisms allow separate control of each digit as well  as thumb–finger opposition and, accordingly, can generate a multitude of grasps. Its sensory system was designed to provide  proprioceptive information as well as to emulate fundamental functional properties of human tactile mechanoreceptors of specific  importance for grasp-and-hold tasks. The CyberHand control system presumes just a few efferent and afferent channels and was  divided in two main layers: a high-level control that interprets the user's intention (grasp selection and required force  level) and can provide pertinent sensory feedback and a low-level control responsible for actuating specific grasps and applying  the desired total force by taking advantage of the intelligent mechanics. The grasps made available by the high-level controller  include those fundamental for activities of daily living: cylindrical, spherical, tridigital (tripod), and lateral grasps.  The modular and flexible design of the CyberHand makes it suitable for incremental development of sensorization, interfacing,  and control strategies and, as such, it will be a useful tool not only for clinical research but also for addressing neuroscientific  hypotheses regarding sensorimotor control.  },

In this work, the inertial effect of swinging a dynamic tail was studied as a method to achieve these rapid turns. An analytic model of a robot with a reaction wheel tail was developed to determine the effect of varying system parameters such as tail motor voltage, coefficient of friction, and tail inertia on inertial turning performance. This model was also validated experimentally using a modified off-the-shelf miniature legged robot. The same trends seen in the analytic study were also found in the experiments varying motor voltage, coefficient of friction, and tail inertia.},

abstract = {1. During each step of running, trotting or hopping part of the gravitational and kinetic energy of the body is absorbed and successively restored by the muscles as in an elastic rebound. In this study we analysed the vertical motion of the centre of gravity of the body during this rebound and defined the relationship between the apparent natural frequency of the bouncing system and the step frequency at the different speeds. 2. The step period and the vertical oscillation of the centre of gravity during the step were divided into two parts: a part taking place when the vertical force exerted on the ground is greater than body weight (lower part of the oscillation) and a part taking place when this force is smaller than body weight (upper part of the oscillation). This analysis was made on running humans and birds; trotting dogs, monkeys and rams; and hopping kangaroos and springhares. 3. During trotting and low-speed running the rebound is symmetric, i.e. the duration and the amplitude of the lower part of the vertical oscillation of the centre of gravity are about equal to those of the upper part. In this case, the step frequency equals the frequency of the bouncing system. 4. At high speeds of running and in hopping the rebound is asymmetric, i.e. the duration and the amplitude of the upper part of the oscillation are greater than those of the lower part, and the step frequency is lower than the frequency of the system. 5. The asymmetry is due to a relative increase in the vertical push. At a given speed, the asymmetric bounce requires a greater power to maintain the motion of the centre of gravity of the body, Wext, than the symmetric bounce. A reduction of the push would decrease Wext but the resulting greater step frequency would increase the power required to accelerate the limbs relative to the centre of gravity, Wint. It is concluded that the asymmetric rebound is adopted in order to minimize the total power, Wext + Wint.},

abstract = {The work done at each step during level walking and running to lift the centre of mass of the body, Wv, and to increase its forward speed, Wf, and the total mechanical energy involved (potential + kinetic) Wext, have been measured at various 'constant' speeds (2-32 km/hr) with the technique described by Cavagna (1975). 2. At intermediate speeds of walking (about 4 km/hr) Wv = Wf and Wext/km is at a minimum, as is the energy cost. At lower speeds Wv greater than Wf whereas at higher speeds Wf greather than Wv: in both cases Wext/km increases. 3. The recovery of mechanical energy, through the pendular motion characteristic of walking, was measured as (/Wv/ + /Wf/ - Wext)/(/Wv/ + /Wf/): it attains a maximum (about 65%) at intermediate speeds. 4. A simple model, assuming that in walking the body rotates as an inverted pendulum over the foot in contact with the ground, fits the experimental data better at intermediate speeds but is no longer tenable above 7 km/hr. 5. In running the recovery defined above is minimal (0-4% independent of speed), i.e. Wext congruent to /Wv/ + /Wf/: potential and kinetic energy of the body do not interchange but are simultaneously taken up and released by the muscles with a rate increasing markedly with the speed (from about 1 to 4 h.p.). 6. Wext increases linearly with the running speed Vf from a positive y intercept owing to the fact that Wv is practically constant independent of Vf. On the contrary, Wf = aVf2/(1 + bVf), where b is the ratio between the time spent in the air and the forward distance covered while on the ground during each step.},

abstract = {The work done during each step to lift and to reaccelerate (in the forward direction) and center of mass has been measured during locomotion in bipeds (rhea and turkey), quadrupeds (dogs, stump-tailed macaques, and ram), and hoppers (kangaroo and springhare). Walking, in all animals (as in man), involves an alternate transfer between gravitational-potential energy and kinetic energy within each stride (as takes place in a pendulum). This transfer is greatest at intermediate walking speeds and can account for up to 70% of the total energy changes taking place within a stride, leaving only 30% to be supplied by muscles. No kinetic-gravitational energy transfer takes place during running, hopping, and trotting, but energy is conserved by another mechanism: an elastic 'bounce' of the body. Galloping animals utilize a combination of these two energy-conserving mechanisms. During running, trotting, hopping, and galloping, 1) the power per unit weight required to maintain the forward speed of the center of mass is almost the same in all the species studied; 2) the power per unit weight required to lift the center of mass is almost independent of speed; and 3) the sum of these two powers is almost a linear function of speed.},

Different from walking, in running the work due to the forward speed changes (variation of kinetic energy) and to the vertical displacement of the center of gravity (variation of potential energy), throughout the step cycle, are substantially in phase. The external work performed per kilometer is independent of speed, amounting to 0.25 kcal/kg km. The total mechanical work amounts to about 0.40–0.50 kcal/kg km. The efficiency in running has been calculated as about 40–50%: such a high value involves a contribution of a substantial amount of energy delivered at a very low cost; this appears to be identified as elastic recoil energy from the stretched contracted muscle and amounts to about half the energy spent in running. A mechanical model is given for the walking and running processes.},

abstract = {Four aspects of the functioning of a fluid-filled cylindrical animal have been examined, viz.: (I) the role of the body fluid as a skeleton for the interaction of the longitudinal and circular muscles of which the animal must be composed; (2) the measurement of the maximum thrust which the animal can exert by measurement of its internal hydrostatic pressure; (3) the application of the force to the substratum and the part played by friction; (4) the relation between the changes in dimensions of the animal and the working length of the muscles.Under (1) the necessity for a longitudinal and circular construction has been shown and the necessity for a closed system emphasized.Under (2) the pressure exerted on the body fluid by the contraction of the longitudinal and circular muscles is discussed, and from their cross-sectional areas it is shown to be probable that when contracting maximally in Lumbricus they are not balanced, but that the longitudinals are about ten times as strong as the circulars.Under (3) it is shown that the strength of an animal as measured by its internal hydrostatic pressure is sufficient to account for its customary activities. Use which may be made of the longitudinals during burrowing is pointed out.Under (4) it is shown to be mechanically sound for burrowing animals of cylindrical form to be fat', but that a thin' animal is more efficient at progression.},

abstract = {Multi-material 3D printing allows objects to be composed of com- plex, heterogeneous arrangements of materials. It is often more nat- ural to define a functional goal than to define the material composi- tion of an object. Translating these functional requirements to fabri- cable 3D prints is still an open research problem. Recently, several specific instances of this problem have been explored (e.g., appear- ance or elastic deformation), but they exist as isolated, monolithic algorithms. In this paper, we propose an abstraction mechanism that simplifies the design, development, implementation, and reuse of these algorithms. Our solution relies on two new data structures: a reducer tree that efficiently parameterizes the space of material assignments and a tuner network that describes the optimization process used to compute material arrangement. We provide an ap- plication programming interface for specifying the desired object and for defining parameters for the reducer tree and tuner network. We illustrate the utility of our framework by implementing several fabrication algorithms as well as demonstrating the manufactured results.},

The fish has a length of 300mm and a mass of 475g, and its overall body is designed as a streamlined shape. The fish's compliant tail is embedded with a bimorph actuation structure sandwiching a piece of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) between two MFC plates. The requirement of high-voltage input limits MFC's application in untethered locomotion for the development of robotic fish. An on-board micro-controller with XBee device and high-voltage amplifier is equipped for wireless control and power supply. Through the experiments of performance test, the robotic fish shows its impressive hydrodynamic performance in the water with a maximum forward speed of 174mm/s (0.58BL/s) and a maximum turning speed of 7.5deg/s which proves the strong potential of the MFC in the development of high performance robotic fish.},

abstract = {A modular robotic system consists of standardized joint and link units that can be assembled into a number of different kinematic configurations. This paper describes the design and kinematic issues of a newly developed modular robot aimed for assembly tasks. All modules are designed as cubic units. There are connecting interfaces, termed connecting ports, on all faces of the cubes so that different kinematic configurations can be achieved by just re-connecting the modules into different ports. A graph based representation scheme, termed assembly incidence matrices (AIM), is employed to indicate the ever changing configurations. The dyad kinematics based on product-of-exponentials formula is introduced. Using dyad kinematics along with a graph traversing algorithm, the authors are able to derive forward kinematics for a modular robot with specific configuration automatically. This formulation can be applied to modular robots with hybrid geometries and is demonstrated by a 3-DOF serial modular robot example View full abstract»},

The device consists of two single-mode fiber and a 10-cm FMF. The two single-mode fiber is offset-spliced to each end of the FMF. When the optical fiber is kept straight and fixed, the interference pattern appears in the transmitted spectrum. As the fiber device is bent, the visibility of the interference fringes (at 1530 nm) decreases, reaching values close to 0.3. The dynamic range of the device can be tailored by the proper selection of the length of FMF. The relationship between the fringe visibility and the curvature is linear while the curvature is between 11 m-1and 16 m-1. The result indicates that the compact sensor can be used in the measurement of large curvature, which is also important in structural health monitoring. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {We have been interested in the synthesis of hydrogels with fast swelling kinetics and superabsorbent properties. To increase the water absorption rate, interconnected pores were introduced to the hydrogels. Since the pore size in the dried hydrogels is in the order of hundreds of micrometers, these hydrogels are called "superporous" hydrogels. Superporous hydrogels were synthesized by crosslinking polymerization of various vinyl monomers in the presence of gas bubbles formed by the chemical reaction of acid and NaHCO3. The polymerization process was optimized to capture the gas bubbles inside the synthesized hydrogels. The use of the NaHCO3/acid system allowed easy control of timing for gelation and foam formation. We found that PF127 was the best foam stabilizer for most of the monomer systems used in our study. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures showed interconnected pores forming capillary channels. The capillary channels, which were critical for fast swelling, were preserved during drying by dehydrating water-swollen hydrogels with ethanol before drying. The ethanol-dehydrated superporous hydrogels reached equilibrium swelling within minutes. The equilibrium swelling time could be reduced to less than a minute with the use of a wetting agent. In our study, water moisture was used as a wetting agent since the amount of moisture content in the dried hydrogels easily could be controlled. Preparation of superporous hydrogels using the right blowing system, foam stabilizer, drying method, and wetting agent makes it possible to reduce the swelling time to less than a minute regardless of the size of the dried gels. The superporous hydrogels can be used where fast swelling and superabsorbent properties are critical.},

In addition, complex fabrication and programming procedures hinder broad applications of existing polymer actuators. Moreover, few of the existing polymer actuators are able to show the self-folding behaviors with the precise control of curvature and force. To address these issues, we report an easy-to-fabricate triple-state actuator with controllable folding behaviors based on bilayer polymer composites with different glass transition temperatures.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Porous structures have emerged as a breakthrough of shape-morphing hydrogels to achieve a rapid response. However, these porous actuators generally suffer from a lack of complexity and diversity in obtained 3D shapes. Herein, a simple yet versatile strategy is developed to generate shape-morphing hydrogels with both fast deformation and enhanced designability in 3D shapes by combining two promising technologies: electrospinning and 3D printing. Elaborate patterns are printed on mesostructured stimuli-responsive electrospun membranes, modulating in-plane and interlayer internal stresses induced by swelling/shrinkage mismatch, and thus guiding morphing behaviors of electrospun membranes to adapt to changes of the environment. With this strategy, a series of fast deformed hydrogel actuators are constructed with various distinctive responsive behaviors, including reversible/irreversible formations of 3D structures, folding of 3D tubes, and formations of 3D structures with multi low-energy states. It is worth noting that although poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) is chosen as the model system in the present research, our strategy is applicable to other stimuli-responsive hydrogels, which enriches designs of rapid deformed hydrogel actuators.},

A fully automatic framework is presented to convert a 2D image into a non-photorealistic line drawing which is suitable for 3D printing. Firstly, an image is partitioned into a moderate number of regions, and contours of these regions are extracted to deliver the high level abstraction of the image. The contour lines are further refined by taking into consideration the restrictions of 3D printing. Next, an orientation field based on the contours and feature lines at a finer level is computed to guide the placement of streamlines. The distances between streamlines are carefully controlled such that the density respects the pixel intensity values. Finally, the resulting streamlines are converted into printing paths and printed by using filaments with specified colors. Experimental results show the feasibility and efficacy of our method on portraying a given image by using a few of 3D printable non-intersecting lines while preserving features and tone variation in the image.},

In particular, wearable applications would benefit from variable stiffness materials in the context of active braces that may stiffen when necessary and soften when mobility is required. In this work, we present fibers capable of adjusting to provide variable stiffness in wearable fabrics. The variable stiffness fibers are made from shape memory materials, where shape memory alloy (SMA) is coated with a thin film of shape memory polymer (SMP). The fibers, which are fabricated via a continuous feed-through process, reduce in bending stiffness by an order of magnitude when the SMP goes through the glass transition. The transition between rubbery and glassy state is accomplished by direct joule heating of the embedded SMA wire. We employ a COMSOL model to relate the current input to the time required for the fibers to transition between stiffness states. Finally, we demonstrate how this device can be worn and act as a joint stability brace on human fingers.},

abstract = {The embodied cognition paradigm emphasizes that both bod- ies and brains combine to produce complex behaviors, in con- trast to the traditional view that the only seat of intelligence is the brain. Despite recent excitement about embodied cogni- tion, brains and bodies remain thought of, and implemented as, two separate entities that merely interface with one an- other to carry out their respective roles. Previous research co-evolving bodies and brains has simulated the physics of bodies that collect sensory information and pass that infor- mation on to disembodied neural networks, which then pro- cesses that information and return motor commands. Biologi- cal animals, in contrast, produce behavior through physically embedded control structures and a complex and continuous interplay between neural and mechanical forces. In addition to the electrical pulses flowing through the physical wiring of the nervous system, the heart elegantly combines control with actuation, as the physical properties of the tissue itself (or defects therein) determine the actuation of the organ. In- spired by these phenomena from cardiac electrophysiology (the study of the electrical properties of heart tissue), we in- troduce electrophysiological robots, whose behavior is dic- tated by electrical signals flowing though the tissue cells of soft robots. Here we describe these robots and how they are evolved. Videos and images of these robots reveal lifelike behaviors despite the added challenge of having physically embedded control structures. We also provide an initial ex- perimental investigation into the impact of different imple- mentation decisions, such as alternatives for sensing, actua- tion, and locations of central pattern generators. Overall, this paper provides a first step towards removing the chasm be- tween bodies and brains to encourage further research into physically realistic embodied cognition.},

This paper presents the design and analysis of a novel thermally tunable composite, namely, a flexible open-cell foam coated in wax that can achieve significant ranges of stiffness, strength, and volume. Experimental results were compared to a proposed model for predicting the bulk compression modulus of the composites. Additionally, preliminary studies indicate that the composites exhibit self-healing properties, in which heating between loading cycles can mend wax that has been plastically deformed, for example, by cracking or delaminating from the foam.},

Cheung and Gershenfeld (p. 1219, published online 15 August; see the Perspective by Schaedler et al.) have mass-produced cross-sectional parts that can be assembled into strong, ultralight lattices. Carbon-fiber composites are sliced into cross-shaped pieces that can be independently tested and reliably assembled into rigid and reversible cuboctahedral lattices.We introduce composite materials made by reversibly assembling a three-dimensional lattice of mass-produced carbon fiber–reinforced polymer composite parts with integrated mechanical interlocking connections. The resulting cellular composite materials can respond as an elastic solid with an extremely large measured modulus for an ultralight material (12.3 megapascals at a density of 7.2 milligrams per cubic centimeter). These materials offer a hierarchical decomposition in modeling, with bulk properties that can be predicted from component measurements and deformation modes that can be determined by the placement of part types. Because site locations are locally constrained, structures can be produced in a relative assembly process that merges desirable features of fiber composites, cellular materials, and additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {The lift that animal wings generate to fly is typically considered a vertical force that supports weight, while drag is considered a horizontal force that opposes thrust. To determine how birds use lift and drag, here we report aerodynamic forces and kinematics of Pacific parrotlets (Forpus coelestis) during short, foraging flights. At takeoff they incline their wing stroke plane, which orients lift forward to accelerate and drag upward to support nearly half of their bodyweight. Upon landing, lift is oriented backward to contribute a quarter of the braking force, which reduces the aerodynamic power required to land. Wingbeat power requirements are dominated by downstrokes, while relatively inactive upstrokes cost almost no aerodynamic power. The parrotlets repurpose lift and drag during these flights with lift-to-drag ratios below two. Such low ratios are within range of proto-wings, showing how avian precursors may have relied on drag to take off with flapping wings.},

To determine the mechanical energy trade-offs of their bimodal locomotion, we rewarded four Pacific parrotlets with a seed for flying voluntarily between instrumented perches inside a new aerodynamic force platform. By integrating direct measurements of both leg and wing forces with kinematics in a bimodal long jump and flight model, we discovered that parrotlets direct their leg impulse to minimize the mechanical energy needed to forage over different distances and inclinations. The bimodal locomotion model further shows how even a small lift contribution from a single proto-wingbeat would have significantly lengthened the long jump of foraging arboreal dinosaurs. These avian bimodal locomotion strategies can also help robots traverse cluttered environments more effectively.},

abstract = {Harnessing flight strategies refined by millions of years of evolution can help expedite the design of more efficient, manoeuvrable and robust flying robots. This review synthesizes recent advances and highlights remaining gaps in our understanding of how bird and bat wing adaptations enable effective flight. Included in this discussion is an evaluation of how current robotic analogues measure up to their biological sources of inspiration. Studies of vertebrate wings have revealed skeletal systems well suited for enduring the loads required during flight, but the mechanisms that drive coordinated motions between bones and connected integuments remain ill-described. Similarly, vertebrate flight muscles have adapted to sustain increased wing loading, but a lack of in vivo studies limits our understanding of specific muscular functions. Forelimb adaptations diverge at the integument level, but both bird feathers and bat membranes yield aerodynamic surfaces with a level of robustness unparalleled by engineered wings. These morphological adaptations enable a diverse range of kinematics tuned for different flight speeds and manoeuvres. By integrating vertebrate flight specializations-particularly those that enable greater robustness and adaptability-into the design and control of robotic wings, engineers can begin narrowing the wide margin that currently exists between flying robots and vertebrates. In turn, these robotic wings can help biologists create experiments that would be impossible in vivo.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to address the problem of online modulation of virtual impedance for an assistive robot based on real-time gait and activity measurements to personalize the assistance for different users at different states. In this work, smart shoes and inertial sensors are introduced to measure ground contact forces and knee joint kinematics, respectively. An automatic impedance tuning (AIT) approach is presented for a knee assistive device (KAD) based on real-time activity recognition and gait phase detection. The activities considered in this paper are level, uphill, and downhill walking. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is employed to map the fuzzy likelihood of various activities and gait phases to the desired virtual impedance of the KAD. The prior estimate of virtual impedance is defined using human knee impedance identified with the walking data collected on different users. The AIT approach is integrated into the high-level impedance-based controller of the KAD for assistance during the stance phase. Finally, to evaluate the benefit of the proposed algorithm in stance phase, an EMG sensor is placed on the vastus medialis muscle group of three participants. The proposed approach is compared with two baseline approaches: constant impedance and finite state machine, and the results demonstrate that the profiles of impedance parameters and robot assistive torque are smoother and the muscle activity of vastus medialis is reduced. It is also noticed that the participants reduce their step lengths and increase walking cadence with assistance from the KAD.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC). This paper presents an intelligent fuzzy inference (IFI) algorithm using inertial measurement units (IMUs) and smart shoes to recognize human activities. IFI algorithm recognizes the activities based on ground contact forces (GCFs) and the knee joint angles. The smart shoes are designed to measure GCFs exerted by the wearer. A total of four IMUs are mounted on bilateral thighs and shanks to provide acceleration and angular rate data. To calculate knee flexion extension, a calibration procedure is adopted which eliminates the need for an external camera system. Then, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the relative orientations of thigh and shank segments, from which knee angle is calculated. Random forest search (RFS) technique is used as a baseline to compare with the performance of the IFI algorithm. To evaluate the performance of this algorithm, several outdoor experiments are conducted on two healthy subjects for six activities including sitting, standing, walking, going upstairs, going downstairs and jogging. The results show that the algorithm is capable of classifying six activities with higher precision and less update time compared to the baseline approach for both subject dependent and independent tests. Also, the algorithm detects transitions between all the activities smoothly such as sit-to-stand or stand-to-walk with higher precision.},

abstract = {Among the different types of direct digital manufacturing (DDM) technologies, some of them can be used for making functionally graded material (FGM) objects. Apart from specific characteristics of the DDM process being employed, one problem in FGM object fabrication is the generation of the corresponding information complete format so that the functionally graded material information can be realized. In this paper, this issue is addressed and the three-dimensional printing (3DP) process is considered as the DDM technology employed for making a FGM prototype. The property of printing a 3D prototype in color is adopted and a methodology is proposed for representing the mechanical properties of an FGM object by color information. In this methodology, an object is considered as "functionally graded" if its mechanical strength is gradually changed within the object and the mechanical strength arisen from gluing powdered material by binders in 3DP is assumed to be proportional to the concentrations of the binders applied in it. If the concentration of each primary color binder is different and a pixel of color is printed in the appropriate proportion, the resultant pixel would have a corresponding binder concentration value. To determine the binder concentration requirements, a computer-aided engineering (CAE) analysis is first carried out and the concentration requirements in different parts of the object are inferred from the CAE analysis result. These requirements are then converted to color information by applying the proposed methodology. As the binder concentrations of different colors are different, a colorful prototype would also be an FGM one. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Developing control policies in simulation is often more practical and safer than directly running experiments in the real world. This applies to policies obtained from planning and optimization, and even more so to policies obtained from reinforcement learning, which is often very data demanding. However, a policy that succeeds in simulation often doesn't work when deployed on a real robot. Nevertheless, often the overall gist of what the policy does in simulation remains valid in the real world. In this paper we investigate such settings, where the sequence of states traversed in simulation remains reasonable for the real world, even if the details of the controls are not, as could be the case when the key differences lie in detailed friction, contact, mass and geometry properties. During execution, at each time step our approach computes what the simulation-based control policy would do, but then, rather than executing these controls on the real robot, our approach computes what the simulation expects the resulting next state(s) will be, and then relies on a learned deep inverse dynamics model to decide which real-world action is most suitable to achieve those next states. Deep models are only as good as their training data, and we also propose an approach for data collection to (incrementally) learn the deep inverse dynamics model. Our experiments shows our approach compares favorably with various baselines that have been developed for dealing with simulation to real world model discrepancy, including output error control and Gaussian dynamics adaptation.},

abstract = {We describe a robot, possessing limited sensory and effectory capabilties but no initial model of the effects of its actions on the world, that acquires such a model through exploration, practice, and observation. By acquiring an increasingly correct model of its actions, it generates increasingly successful plans to achieve its goals. In an apparently non-deterministic world, achieving reliability requires the identification of reliable actions and a preference for using such actions. Furthermore, by selecting its training carefully, the robot can significantly improve its learning rate.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to propose a method for automatic flattening of surface features, which are decomposed from a solid model, into 2D flat models. In this research, a sheet metal product is described as a solid model. Using a feature decomposition method, the boundary representation of the solid model is decomposed into surface features, and each feature is represented as a face-edge graph. Among the faces in a feature, an appropriate one is selected as the base face. With the base face as a root, a spanning tree is constructed from the face-edge graph of the feature, and edges for splitting and folding, respectively, are identified. Thereafter, the faces, other than the base face, are rotated to the plane of the base face around their folding axes, and the 2D flat model for a feature can be obtained. According to the messages identifying edges requiring folding or fastening, manufacturers can produce the feature using the reverse process of flattening. Also, computer graphics is used to animate the feature decomposition and flattening procedures.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the design and analysis of underactuated robotic hands that use tendons and compliant joints to enable passive mechanical adaptation during grasping tasks. We use a quasistatic equilibrium formulation to predict the stability of a given grasp. This method is then used as the inner loop of an optimization algorithm that can find a set of actuation mechanism parameters that optimize the stability measure for an entire set of grasps. We discuss two possible approaches to design optimization using this framework, one using exhaustive search over the parameter space, and the other using a simplified gripper construction to cast the problem to a form that is directly solvable using well-established optimization methods. Computations are performed in 3-D, allow arbitrary geometry of the grasped objects and take into account frictional constraints.},

abstract = {We design, optimize and demonstrate the behavior of a tendon-driven robotic gripper performing parallel, enveloping and fingertip grasps. The gripper consists of two fingers, each with two links, and is actuated using a single active tendon. During unobstructed closing, the distal links remain parallel, for parallel grasps. If the proximal links are stopped by contact with an object, the distal links start flexing, creating a stable enveloping grasp. We optimize the route of the active flexor tendon and the route and stiffness of a passive extensor tendon in order to achieve this behavior. We show how the resulting gripper can also execute fingertip grasps for picking up small objects off a flat surface, using contact with the surface to its advantage through passive adaptation. Finally, we introduce a method for optimizing the dimensions of the links in order to achieve enveloping grasps of a large range of objects, and apply it to a set of common household objects.},

abstract = {In the free walking rock lobster the forces developed by legs 4 and 5 were investigated during the power stroke. Two orthogonal force components lying in the horizontal plane were measured. Based on these results the diffent tasks of the two legs during walking are discussed. The forces developed by leg 4 were compared when the animal walked freely and on a treadmill. In these two situations the results differ qualitatively as in driven walking the forces are nearly identical in a long series of consecutive steps whereas in free walking the forces can vary greatly from step to step. However, similar mean values of force were measured with those on the treadmill being somewhat higher. This shows that, although the treadmill is driven by a motor, the animal does perform active walking movements. In the treadmill situation the forces increase as the speed of treadmill motor is decreased. {\textcopyright} 1982 Springer-Verlag.},

Thrust is found to increase with non-dimensional frequency, and an optimal oscillatory gait is identified.

The paper begins by briefly reviewing the history and role of design in the engineering curriculum. Several dimensions of design thinking are then detailed, explaining why design is hard to learn and harder still to teach, and outlining the research available on how well design thinking skills are learned. The currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, project-based learning (PBL), is explored next, along with available assessment data on its success. Two contexts for PBL are emphasized: first-year cornerstone courses and globally dispersed PBL courses. Finally, the paper lists some of the open research questions that must be answered to identify the best pedagogical practices of improving design learning, after which it closes by making recommendations for research aimed at enhancing design learning.

abstract = {Properties of the human embodiment - sensorimotor apparatus and neurological structure - participate directly in the growth and development of cognitive processes against enormous worst case complexity. It is our position that relationships between morphology and perception over time lead to increasingly comprehensive models that describe the agent's relationship to the world. We are applying insight derived from neuroscience, neurology, and developmental psychology to the design of advanced robot architectures. To investigate developmental processes, we have begun to approximate the human sensorimotor configuration and to engage sensory and motor subsystems in developmental sequences. Many such sequences have been documented in studies of infant development, so we intend to bootstrap cognitive structures in robots by emulating some of these growth processes that bear an essential resemblance to the human morphology. In this paper, we will show two related examples in which a humanoid robot determines the models and representations that govern its behavior. The first is a model that captures the dynamics of a haptic exploration of an object with a dextrous robot hand that supports skillful grasping. The second example constructs constellations of visual features to predict relative hand/object postures that lead reliably to haptic utility. The result is a first step in a trajectory toward associative visual-haptic categories that bounds the incremental complexity of each stage of development.},

Students are given the task of writing computer programs to race a simulated car around a track. In doing so, students learn and implement numerical methods content. The design of the course, around a video game, is rooted in commonly accepted theories of how people learn. The article describes a study to assess the effectiveness of the video game-based course. Results show that students taking the game-based course, on average, spend roughly twice as much time, outside of class, on their course work. In a concept mapping exercise, students taking the game-based course demonstrate deeper learning compared to their counterparts taking traditional lecture/textbook-based numerical methods courses. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Collins2015,
abstract = {With efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning, humans are very well-tuned for locomotion. Metabolic energy used during walking can be partly replaced by power input from an exoskeleton, but is it possible to reduce metabolic rate without providing an additional energy source? This would require an improvement in the efficiency of the human-machine system as a whole, and would be remarkable given the apparent optimality of human gait. Here we show that the metabolic rate of human walking can be reduced by an unpowered ankle exoskeleton. We built a lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the user's calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the metabolic energy consumed in contractions. The device uses a mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is stretched and relaxed by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping to fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon. Unlike muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The exoskeleton consumes no chemical or electrical energy and delivers no net positive mechanical work, yet reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 ± 2.6% for healthy human users under natural conditions, comparable to savings with powered devices. Improving upon walking economy in this way is analogous to altering the structure of the body such that it is more energy-effective at walking. While strong natural pressures have already shaped human locomotion, improvements in efficiency are still possible. Much remains to be learned about this seemingly simple behaviour.},

Design aspects covered here include the freely rotating hip joint with angle bisecting mechanism; freely rotating knee joints with latches; direct actuation of the ankles with a spring, release mechanism, and reset motor; wide feet that are shaped to aid lateral stability; and the simple control algorithm. The biomechanics context of this robot is discussed in more detail in [1], and movies of the robot walking are available at Science Online and http://www.tam.cornell.edu/$\sim$ruina/powerwalk.html. This robot adds evidence to the idea that passive-dynamic approaches might help design walking robots that are simpler, more efficient and easier to control. },

To facilitate product development decisions, a reference system is shown describing the key attributes of a product from a manufacturability stand-point: complexity, customization, and production volume. Complexity and customization scales enable the grouping of products into regions of the map with common levels of the three attributes. A geometric complexity factor developed for cast parts is modified for a more general application. Parts with varying geometric complexity are then analyzed and mapped into regions of the complexity, customization, and production volume model. A discrete set of customization levels are also introduced. Implications for product development and manufacturing business approaches are discussed.},

The receptors are surface-imprinted polyurethane layers deposited on stainless-steel chips. Regarding the transducer principle, the sensor measures the increase in thermal resistance between the chip and the liquid due to the presence of bacteria captured on the receptor surface. The low noise level that enables the low detection limit originates from a planar meander element that serves as both a heater and a temperature sensor. Furthermore, the experiments show that the presence of bacteria in a liquid enhances the thermal conductivity of the liquid itself. Reference tests with a set of other representative species of Enterobacteriaceae, closely related to E. coli, indicate a very low cross-sensitivity with a sensor response at or below the noise level.},

We first acquire a surprisingly accurate aircraft model through unsteady flight regimes from real kinematic flight data taken in a motion-capture arena. This model is then used in a numerical nonlinear (approximate) optimal control procedure which designs a feedback control policy for the elevator deflection. Finally, we report our experimental data demonstrating that this simple glider can exploit pressure drag to achieve a high-speed perching maneuver.},

consequences for the ecology and evolution of volant taxa.
However, few studies have directly investigated how flying
animals navigate through cluttered environments, or examined
which aspects of flight performance are most critical for this
challenging task. Here, we examined how body size, acceleration
and obstacle orientation affect the flight of bumblebees in an
artificial, cluttered environment. Non-steady flight performance
is often predicted to decrease with body size, as a result of a
presumed reduction in acceleration capacity, but few empirical
tests of this hypothesis have been performed in flying animals.
We found that increased body size is associated with impaired
flight performance (specifically transit time) in cluttered
environments, but not with decreased peak accelerations. In
addition, previous studies have shown that flying insects can
produce higher accelerations along the lateral body axis,
suggesting that if maneuvering is constrained by acceleration
capacity, insects should perform better when maneuvering around
objects laterally rather than vertically. Our data show that
bumblebees do generate higher accelerations in the lateral
direction, but we found no difference in their ability to pass
through obstacle courses requiring lateral versus vertical
maneuvering. In sum, our results suggest that acceleration
capacity is not a primary determinant of flight performance in
clutter, as is often assumed. Rather than being driven by the
scaling of acceleration, we show that the reduced flight
performance of larger bees in cluttered environments is driven by
the allometry of both path sinuosity and mean flight speed.
Specifically, differences in collision-avoidance behavior
underlie much of the variation in flight performance across body
size, with larger bees negotiating obstacles more cautiously.
Thus, our results show that cluttered environments challenge the
flight capacity of insects, but in surprising ways that emphasize
the importance of behavioral and ecological context for
understanding flight performance in complex environments.},

Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the large subunit (26S) rRNA gene D1/D2 domain sequences showed that strain YJ2E(T) was located in a clade together with Candida haemulonii and C. pseudohaemulonii. Strain YF9E(T) was most closely related to C. azyma and strain YWZH3C(T) to C. sorbophila and C. spandovensis. Strain YYF2A(T) was clustered in a clade containing small-spored Metschnikowia species and related anamorphic Candida species. The new strains differed from their closely related described species by more than 10% mismatches in the D1/D2 domain. No sexual states were observed for the four strains on various sporulation media. The new species are therefore assigned to the genus Candida and described as Candida alocasiicola sp. nov. (type strain, YF9E(T) = AS 2.3484(T) = CBS 10702(T)), Candida hainanensis sp. nov. (type strain, YYF2A(T) = AS 2.3478(T) = CBS 10696(T)), Candida heveicola sp. nov.

abstract = {In many applications of vibration and wave theory the magnitudes of the damping forces are small in comparison with the elastic and inertia forces. These small forces may, however, have very great influence under certain special circumstances. Damping arises from the removal of energy by radiation or dissipation. It is generally measured under conditions of cyclic or near-cyclic motion. The nature of some important damping mechanisms is discussed and an indication is given of how the damping depends on the amplitude and frequency of the cyclic motion. The idealized models of damping which are commonly employed in theoretical analyses are described and some limitations are noted. Damping is of primary importance in controlling vibration response amplitudes under conditions of steady-state resonance and stationary random excitation. Damping also plays a crucial role in fixing the borderline between stability and instability in many dynamical systems. Some examples which illustrate this are discussed, including shaft whirl, and pipeline flutter. {\textcopyright} 1970 Academic Press Inc. (London) Limited.},

abstract = {Research into the developmental of artificial mechanical hands for prosthetic applications has been conducted over many hundreds of years. Dexterous mechanical hands are now being applied to advanced robotic applications, including tele-operated manipulators. The successful application of dexterous mechanical hands depends on the development of suitable mechanisms, actuators and control strategies. Recently the requirement arose for a manipulator to fit and operate within a standard glove box glove. The design and development of a fully anthropomorphic dexterous end effector for the manipulator is discussed in this paper. To arrive at the final design a study of the operation of the human hand was undertaken. The end effector consists of four mechanically adaptive fingers and a thumb. The mechanism developed for the fingers will simulate the curl of the human finger. The complete finger mechanism requires only a single actuator to produce fully the required motion, leading to a compact design for the end effector. To gain the full operational advantage of the dexterous hand a control strategy has been developed based on global sensing and a hierarchical control structure. The results of handling trials are presented.},

abstract = {The Palaearctic genus Arvicola includes two species: the south-western water vole A.sapidus, and the northern water vole A.terrestris. The latter has semiaquatic and/or subterranean populations, while populations of A.sapidus are always semiaquatic. According to the current phylogenetic and palaeontological data, adaptation to semiaquatic life is plesiomorphic for the genus Arvicola. We studied the ontogenetic allometry of skull and long bones of the semiaquatic A.sapidus, a semiaquatic population of A.terrestris (A.t.italicus), and two fossorial populations of A.terrestris (A.t.scherman and A.t.monticola). Animals from fossorial populations were smaller than were those from semiaquatic populations. We found that most of the ontogenetic allometric exponents of characters linked to digging in the skull and in the long bones were significantly higher in A.t.monticola, a fossorial clade, than they were in the semiaquatic populations. On the other hand, there may have been an evolutionary lag between invasion of the hypogeic habitat and the acquisition of fossorial adaptations in A.t.scherman. We showed statistically that the morphological differences linked to the invasion of a hypogeic habitat are already present in juvenile animals and, according to these results, suggest that these morphological differences are the direct expression of genetic changes rather than the outcome of epigenetic factors of mechanical origin. Moreover, we tried to ascertain whether the apomorphic shape of the skull and long bones in the fossorial populations of A.terrestris (compared with the primitive condition that would have been retained by the semiaquatic A.sapidus) are the outcome of a heterochronic process. Optimization by squared change parsimony supported the hypothesis of an apomorphic reduction of body size linked to the invasion of the subterranean habitat. The comparison of the ontogenetic trajectories of both skull shape and long bone shape suggested that a heterochronic process was involved in this morphological transformation. By using the `clock model' method, this mechanism was identified as `accelerated dwarfism' affecting both the skull and long bones. 2006 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2006, 87, 381391.},

abstract = {South American electric knifefish are a leading model system within neurobiology. Recent efforts have focused on understanding their biomechanics and relating this to their neural processing strategies. Knifefish swim by means of an undulatory fin that runs most of the length of their body, affixed to the belly. Propelling themselves with this fin enables them to keep their body relatively straight while swimming, enabling straightforward robotic implementation with a rigid hull. In this study, we examined the basic properties of undulatory swimming through use of a robot that was similar in some key respects to the knifefish. As we varied critical fin kinematic variables such as frequency, amplitude, and wavelength of sinusoidal traveling waves, we measured the force generated by the robot when it swam against a stationary sensor, and its velocity while swimming freely within a flow tunnel system. Our results show that there is an optimal operational region in the fin's kinematic parameter space. The optimal actuation parameters found for the robotic knifefish are similar to previously observed parameters for the black ghost knifefish, Apteronotus albifrons. Finally, we used our experimental results to show how the force generated by the robotic fin can be decomposed into thrust and drag terms. Our findings are useful for future bio-inspired underwater vehicles as well as for understanding the mechanics of knifefish swimming.},

We consider the information that these various types of sensors provide in terms of whether they are most useful for manipulation, surface exploration or being responsive to contacts from external agents. Concerning the interpretation of tactile information, we describe the general problems and present two short illustrative examples. The first involves intrinsic tactile sensing, i.e., estimating contact locations and forces from force sensors. The second involves contact pressure sensing, i.e., estimating surface normal and shear stress distributions from an array of sensors in an elastic skin. We conclude with a brief discussion of the challenges that remain to be solved in packaging and manufacturing damage-tolerant tactile sensors.},

abstract = {Grid technologies enable large-scale sharing of resources within formal or informal consortia of individuals and/or institutions: what are sometimes called virtual organizations. In these settings, the discovery, characterization, and monitoring of resources, services, and computations are challenging problems due to the considerable diversity; large numbers, dynamic behavior, and geographical distribution of the entities in which a user might be interested. Consequently, information services are a vital part of any Grid software infrastructure, providing fundamental mechanisms for discovery and monitoring, and hence for planning and adapting application behavior. We present an information services architecture that addresses performance, security, scalability, and robustness requirements. Our architecture defines simple low-level enquiry and registration protocols that make it easy to incorporate individual entities into various information structures, such as aggregate directories that support a variety of different query languages and discovery strategies. These protocols can also be combined with other Grid protocols to construct additional higher-level services and capabilities such as brokering, monitoring, fault detection, and troubleshooting. Our architecture has been implemented as MDS-2, which forms part of the Globus Grid toolkit and has been widely deployed and applied},

However the criterion can break down for\nmechanisms with special geometries, and in particular the class of\nso-called overconstrained parallel mechanisms. The problem is that the\ncriterion treats all constraints as active, even redundant constraints,\nwhich do not affect the mechanism degrees of freedom. In this paper we\nreveal a number of screw systems of a parallel mechanism, explore their\ninter-relationship and develop an original theoretical framework to\nrelate these screw systems to motion and constraints of a parallel\nmechanism to identify the platform constraints, mechanism constraints\nand redundant constraints. The screw system characteristics and\nrelationships are investigated for physical properties and a new\napproach to mobility analysis is proposed based on decompositions of\nmotion and constraint screw systems. New versions of the mobility\ncriterion are thus presented to eliminate the redundant constraints and\naccurately predict the platform degrees of freedom. Several examples of\noverconstrained mechanisms from the literature illustrate the results.},

abstract = {For a terrestrial animal to move in the complex natural environment, the limb muscles must modulate force and work performance to meet changing mechanical requirements; however, it is not clear whether this is accomplished via a collective shift in function by all limb muscles, or a division of labor among limb muscles. Do muscles differ in their ability to modulate force-length contractile function to meet the mechanical demands of different locomotor tasks? We explore this question by examining the in vivo force-length performance of the guinea fowl Numida meleagris lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and digital flexor-IV (DF-IV), during level and incline locomotion. During level locomotion, the LG and DF-IV exhibit differing muscle fascicle strain patterns: the LG shortens by 10-15% while developing force, whereas the DF-IV undergoes a stretch-shorten cycle with large strain amplitudes and small net strains of 1-8%. Furthermore, the DF-IV operates at higher muscle stresses (92-130 kPa, compared to 23-39 kPa for LG) and possesses a longer tendon, which allows the DF-IV tendon to recover greater elastic energy than the LG tendon. During incline locomotion, these muscles contribute only one-third of the energy expected for their mass, with the DF-IV exhibiting high stride-to-stride variability in work output. While the stretch-shorten cycle of the DF-IV muscle may allow more economic force production, it also leads to large changes in work output with small changes in the relative timing of force and strain. Thus, while the primary determinants of LG work are net strain and mean force, the primary determinant of DF-IV work is the phase relationship between force and strain. Our results suggest that, in addition to influencing a muscle's mechanical performance during steady level locomotion, morphology also affects its capacity and mechanism for altering work output for different locomotor tasks.},

abstract = {Despite the rapid advance of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies in recent years, methods to fully encase objects with multilayer, thick features are still undeveloped. This issue can be overcome by printing layers conformally about an object's natural bound-ary, as opposed to current methods that utilize planar layering. With this mindset, two methods are derived to generate layers between the boundaries of initial and desired geo-metric objects in both two and three dimensions. The first method is based on variable offset curves (VOCs) and is applicable to pairs of initial and desired geometric objects that satisfy mild compatibility conditions. In this method, layers are generated by uni-formly partitioning each of the normal line segments emanating from the initial object boundary and intersecting the desired object. The second method is based on manipu-lated solutions to Laplace's equation and is applicable to all geometric objects. Using each method, we present examples of layer generation for several objects of varying con-vexities. Results are compared, and the respective advantages and limitations of each method are discussed.},

An important aspect of the Rapid Prototype technique used here is that this multi-articulated hand will be fabricated in one step, without requiring assembly, while maintaining its desired mobility. The use of Shape Memory Alloy actuators combined with the rapid fabrication of the non-assembly type hand, reduce considerably its weight and fabrication time. Therefore, the focus of this paper is the mechanical design of a dexterous hand that combines Rapid Prototype techniques and smart actuators. The type of robotic hand described in this paper can be utilized for applications requiring low weight, compactness, and dexterity such as prosthetic devices, space and planetary exploration.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design of a body-powered voluntary closing prosthetic hand. It is argued that the movement of the fingers before establishing a grip is much less relevant for good control of the object held than the distribution of forces once the object has been contacted. Based on this notion, the configurations of forces on the fingers and the force transmission through the whole mechanism were taken as a point of departure for the design, rather than movement characteristics. For a good distribution of pinching forces on the object and a natural behavior, the prosthesis is made adaptive and flexible. To achieve good force feedback, the disturbing influences of the cosmetic glove are strongly reduced by a compensation mechanism. To further improve the transmission of forces, friction is reduced by furnishing the whole mechanism with rolling links. This force-directed design approach has led to a simple mechanism with low operating force and good feedback of the pinching force.},

abstract = {We have built a 12DOF, passive-compliant legged, tailed biped actuated by four brushless DC motors. We anticipate that this machine will achieve varied modes of quasistatic and dynamic balance, enabling a broad range of locomotion tasks including sitting, standing, walking, hopping, running, turning, leaping, and more. Achieving this diversity of behavior with a single under-actuated body, requires a correspondingly diverse array of controllers, motivating our interest in compositional techniques that promote mixing and reuse of a relatively few base constituents to achieve a combinatorially growing array of available choices. Here we report on the development of one important example of such a behavioral programming method, the construction of a novel monopedal sagittal plane hopping gait through parallel composition of four decoupled 1DOF base controllers. For this example behavior, the legs are locked in phase and the body is fastened to a boom to restrict motion to the sagittal plane. The platform's locomotion is powered by the hip motor that adjusts leg touchdown angle in flight and balance in stance, along with a tail motor that adjusts body shape in flight and drives energy into the passive leg shank spring during stance. The motor control signals arise from the application in parallel of four simple, completely decoupled 1DOF feedback laws that provably stabilize in isolation four corresponding 1DOF abstract reference plants. Each of these abstract 1DOF closed loop dynamics represents some simple but crucial specific component of the locomotion task at hand. We present a partial proof of correctness for this parallel composition of template reference systems along with data from the physical platform suggesting these templates are anchored as evidenced by the correspondence of their characteristic motions with a suitably transformed image of traces from the physical platform.},

abstract = {As the name suggests, multi-objective optimization involves optimizing a number of objectives si- multaneously. The problem becomes challenging when the objectives are of conflict to each other, that is, the optimal solution of an objective function is different from that of the other. In solving such problems, with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set of trade-off opti- mal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Due to the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved suitably using evolutionary algorithms which use a population ap- proach in its search procedure. Starting with parameterized procedures in early nineties, the so-called evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms is now an established field of research and application with many dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and workshops held at all major evolutionary computing conferences, and full-time researchers from uni- versities and industries from all around the globe. In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction to its operating principles and outline the current research and application studies of EMO.},

abstract = {Earwig wings are highly foldable structures that lack internal muscles. The behaviour and shape changes of the wings during flight are yet unknown. We assume that they meet a great structural challenge to control the occurring deformations and prevent the wing from collapsing. At the folding structures especially, the wing could easily yield to the pressure. Detailed microscopy studies reveal adaptions in the structure and material which are not relevant for folding purposes. The wing is parted into two structurally different areas with, for example, a different trend or stiffness of the wing veins. The storage of stiff or more flexible material shows critical areas which undergo great changes or stress during flight. We verified this with high-speed video recordings. These reveal the extent of the occurring deformations and their locations, and support our assumptions. The video recordings reveal a dynamical change of a concave flexion line. In the static unfolded state, this flexion line blocks a folding line, so that the wing stays unfolded. However, during flight it extends and blocks a second critical folding line and prevents the wing from collapsing. With these results, more insight in passive wing control, especially within high foldable structures, is gained.},

abstract = {We present a new method for planning footstep placements for a robot walking on uneven terrain with obsta- cles, using a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP). Our approach is unique in that it handles obstacle avoidance, kinematic reachability, and rotation of footstep placements, which typically have required non-convex constraints, in a single mixed-integer optimization that can be efficiently solved to its global optimum. Reachability is enforced through a convex inner approximation of the reachable space for the robot's feet. Rotation of the footsteps is handled by a piecewise linear approximation of sine and cosine, designed to ensure that the approximation never overestimates the robot's reachability. Obstacle avoidance is ensured by decomposing the environment into convex regions of obstacle-free configuration space and assigning each footstep to one such safe region. We demonstrate this technique in simple 2D and 3D environments and with real environments sensed by a humanoid robot. We also discuss computational performance of the algorithm, which is currently capable of planning short sequences of a few steps in under one second or longer sequences of 10-30 footsteps in tens of seconds to minutes on common laptop computer hardware. Our implementation is available within the Drake MATLAB toolbox.},

The evolutionary transitions from prokaryotes to unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans were accompanied by major innovations in metabolic design. Here we show that the scalings of metabolic rate, population growth rate, and production efficiency with body size have changed across the evolutionary transitions. Metabolic rate scales with body mass superlinearly in prokaryotes, linearly in protists, and sublinearly in metazoans, so Kleiber's 3/4 power scaling law does not apply universally across organisms. The scaling of maximum population growth rate shifts from positive in prokaryotes to negative in protists and metazoans, and the efficiency of production declines across these groups. Major changes in metabolic processes during the early evolution of life overcame existing constraints, exploited new opportunities, and imposed new constraints.},

@article{Demaine1978,
abstract = {Folding and unfolding problems have been implicit since Albrecht D¨ early 1500's [D¨ urer in the ur77], but have not been studied extensively in the mathematical literature until recently. Over the past few years, there has been a surge of inter- est in these problems in discrete and computational geometry. This paper gives a brief survey of most of the work in this area. Related, shorter surveys are given by Demaine [Dem00], Demaine and Demaine [DD01], and O'Rourke [O'R98]. We are currently preparing a monograph on the topic [DO05]. In general, we are interested in how objects (such as linkages, pieces of pa- per, and polyhedra) can be moved or reconfigured (folded) subject to certain constraints depending on the type of object and the problem of interest. Typ- ically the process of unfolding approaches a more basic shape, whereas folding complicates the shape. We define the configuration space as the set of all config- urations or states of the object permitted by the folding constraints, with paths in the space corresponding to motions (foldings) of the object. This survey is divided into three sections corresponding to the type of object being folded: linkages, paper, or polyhedra. Unavoidably, areas with which we are more familiar or for which there is a more extensive literature are covered in more detail. For example, more problems have been explored in linkage and paper folding than in polyhedron folding, and our corresponding sections reflect this imbalance. On the other hand, this survey cannot do justice to the wealth of research on protein folding, so only a partial survey appears in Section 2.5.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the forces animals generate and are exposed to during locomotion is an important prerequisite for understanding the musculoskeletal correlates of locomotor modes. We recorded takeoff and landing forces for 14 animals representing seven species of strepsirhine primates with a compliant force pole. Our sample included both specialized vertical clingers and leapers and more generalized species. Takeoff forces are higher than landing forces. Peak forces during acceleration for takeoff ranged from 6 to 12 times body weight, and the peak impact forces at landing are between 5 and 9 times body weight. There is a size-related trend in peak force magnitudes. Both takeoff and landing forces decrease with increasing body size in our sample of animals from 1 kg to over 5 kg. Peak forces increase with distance leapt. The distance effect is less clear, probably due to the narrow range of distances represented in our sample. A comparison of subadult and adult animals of two species of sifakas reveals a tendency for the young animals to exert relatively higher peak forces in comparison to their adult conspecifics. Finally, Lemur catta and Eulemur rubriventer, the "generalists" in our sample, tend to generate higher forces for equal tasks than the specialized vertical clingers and leapers (i.e., the indriids and Hapalemur).A broad-scale comparison of peak leaping forces and peak forces for quadrupedal and bipedal walking and running shows that leaping at small body size is associated with exceptionally high forces. Whereas relative forces (i.e., forces divided by body weight) decrease with increasing body mass for leaping, forces for walking and running do not change much with size. Leaping forces in our sample scale to (mass)(-1/3), which is consistent with expectations derived from geometric similarity models. Forces associated with other locomotor activities do not appear to follow this pattern. The very high forces found in strepsirhine leapers do not seem to be matched by bone robusticity beyond that documented for quadrupedal species.},

abstract = {Ground reaction forces were recorded for jumps of three individuals each of Lemur catta and Eulemur fulvus. Animals jumped back and forth between a ground-mounted force plate and a 0.5-m elevated platform, covering horizontal distances of 0.5-2 m. In total, 190 takeoffs and 263 landings were collected. Animals typically jumped from a run up and into a run out, during which they gained or into which they carried horizontal impulse. Correspondingly, vertical impulses dominated takeoffs and landings. Peak forces were moderate in magnitude and not much higher than forces reported for quadrupedal gaits. This is in contrast to the forces for standing jumps of specialized leapers that considerably exceed forces associated with quadrupedal gaits. Force magnitudes for the lemur jumps are more comparable to peak forces reported for other quadrupeds performing running jumps. Takeoffs are characterized by higher hindlimb than forelimb peak forces and impulses. L. catta typically landed with the hindlimbs making first contact, and the hindlimb forces and impulses were higher than the forelimb forces and impulses at landing. E. fulvus typically landed with the forelimbs striking first and also bearing the higher forces. This pattern does not fully conform to the paradigm of primate limb force distribution, with higher hindlimb than forelimb forces. However, the absolute highest forces in E. fulvus also occur at the hindlimbs, during acceleration for takeoff.},

The development of such an arm is useful for gentle exploration of unknown objects in unstructured environments. Similar to a human, the robotic arm should minimize the contact forces in the event of unanticipated contact with unknown objects in the absence of visual feedback. To accomplish this, our strategy is to develop a good model of the robotic system so that we can use low gains which in turn will lead to low impedance and hence low contact forces in manipulation tasks in unstructured environments. The paper demonstrates how good modeling and feedforward compensation can result in low interaction forces without any external force sensing. We present experimental results to demonstrate the validity of our model and approach.},

abstract = {A dynamic model of a jump glider is presented and correlated with the results obtained with a prototype glider. The glider uses a carbon fiber spring and a main wing that pivots approximately parallel to the airflow during ascent and latches into place for a gliding descent. The robot demonstrates longer traveled distance than an equivalent drag-free ballistic mass. A detailed numerical and a simplified algebraic model are also introduced, which are useful for exploring design tradeoffs and performance. These models suggest ways to improve the traveled distance and indicate that with modest variations in the wing angle of attack during ascent, one can choose from a variety of launch angles to accommodate variations in ground friction without greatly compromising range.},

abstract = {A mechanical representation of batoid-like propulsion using a flexible fin with an elliptical planform shape is used to study the hydrodynamics of undulatory propulsion. The wake is found to consist of a series of interconnected vortex rings, whereby leading and trailing edge vortices of subsequent cycles become entangled with one another. Efficient propulsion is achieved when leading and trailing edge vortices coalesce at the spanwise location where most of the streamwise fluid momentum is concentrated in the wake of the fin. Both the Strouhal number and the wavelength are found to have a significant effect on the wake structure. In general, a decrease in wavelength promotes a wake transition from shedding a single vortex per half-oscillation period to shedding a pair of vortices per half-oscillation period. An increase in Strouhal number causes the wake to bifurcate a finite distance downstream of the trailing edge of the fin into a pair of jets oriented at an acute angle to the line of symmetry. The bifurcation distance decreases with increasing Strouhal number and wavelength, and it is shown to obey a simple scaling law.},

abstract = {Most batoids have a unique swimming mode in which thrust is generated by either oscillating or undulating expanded pectoral fins that form a disc. Only one previous study of the freshwater stingray has quantified three-dimensional motions of the wing, and no comparable data are available for marine batoid species that may differ considerably in their mode of locomotion. Here, we investigate three-dimensional kinematics of the pectoral wing of the little skate, Leucoraja erinacea, swimming steadily at two speeds {[}1 and 2 body lengths (BL) s(-1)]. We measured the motion of nine points in three dimensions during wing oscillation and determined that there are significant differences in movement amplitude among wing locations, as well as significant differences as speed increases in body angle, wing beat frequency and speed of the traveling wave on the wing. In addition, we analyzed differences in wing curvature with swimming speed. At 1 BL s(-1), the pectoral wing is convex in shape during the downstroke along the medio-lateral fin midline, but at 2 BL s(-1) the pectoral fin at this location cups into the flow, indicating active curvature control and fin stiffening. Wing kinematics of the little skate differed considerably from previous work on the freshwater stingray, which does not show active cupping of the whole fin on the downstroke.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.We quantify the oxygen consumption rates and cost of transport (COT) of a benthic batoid fish, the little skate, Leucoraja erinacea, at three swimming speeds. We report that this species has the lowest mass-adjusted swimming metabolic rate measured for any elasmobranch; however, this species incurs a much higher COT at approximately five times the lowest values recorded for some teleosts. In addition, because skates lack a propulsive caudal fin and could not sustain steady swimming beyond a relatively low optimum speed of 1.25 body lengths s-1, we propose that the locomotor efficiency of benthic rajiform fishes is limited to the descending portion of a single COT-speed relationship. This renders these species poorly suited for long-distance translocation and, therefore, especially vulnerable to regional-scale environmental disturbances.},

Here we present a theory for the simplest such structure: an annular circular strip that is folded along a central circular curve to form a three-dimensional buckled structure driven by geometrical frustration. We quantify this shape in terms of the radius of the circle, the dihedral angle of the fold and the mechanical properties of the sheet of paper and the fold itself. When the sheet is isometrically deformed everywhere except along the fold itself, stiff folds result in creases with constant curvature and oscillatory torsion. However, relatively softer folds inherit the broken symmetry of the buckled shape with oscillatory curvature and torsion. Our asymptotic analysis of the isometrically deformed state is corroborated by numerical simulations which allow us to generalize our analysis to study multiply folded structures.},

Locomotor control systems combine rapid mechanical preflexes with multimodal sensory feedback and feedforward commands. Muscles have a surprising variety of functions in locomotion, serving as motors, brakes, springs, and struts. Integrative approaches reveal not only how each component within a locomotor system operates but how they function as a collective whole.},

abstract = {Clutches can be used to enhance the functionality of springs or actuators in robotic devices. Here we describe a lightweight, low-power clutch used to control spring engagement in an ankle exoskeleton. The clutch is based on electrostatic adhesion between thin electrode sheets coated with a dielectric material. Each electrode pair weighs 1.5 g, bears up to 100 N, and changes states in less than 30 ms. We placed clutches in series with elastomer springs to allow control of spring engagement, and placed several clutched springs in parallel to discretely adjust stiffness. By engaging different numbers of springs, the system produced six different levels of stiffness. Force at peak displacement ranged from 14 to 501 N, and the device returned 95% of stored mechanical energy. Each clutched spring element weighed 26 g. We attached one clutched spring to an ankle exoskeleton and used it to engage the spring only while the foot was on the ground during 150 consecutive walking steps. Peak torque was 7.3 N{\textperiodcentered}m on an average step, and the device consumed 0.6 mW of electricity. Compared to other electrically-controllable clutches, this approach results in three times higher torque density and two orders of magnitude lower power consumption per unit torque. We anticipate this technology will be incorporated into exoskeletons that tune stiffness online and into new actuator designs that utilize many lightweight, low-power clutches acting in concert.},

Besides reliable performance, the hand is durable, is produced using a molding process that allows both for inexpensive mass production as well as a realistic appearance without the need for a cosmetic glove, and incorporates a simple design that requires only a single actuator for the eight active degrees of freedom. All of these factors make it a good candidate as a basis for either a body-powered or externally-powered prosthetic terminal device that is realistic, functional, robust, and inexpensive.},

abstract = {Curve walking in two species of crayfish, Procambarus clarkii and Astacus leptodactylus, was investigated to test whether the mechanism underlying curve walking is the synchronous action of a centrally pre-programmed leg tripod or whether it is the action of one principal leg that produces the main body yaw torque. Curve walking was induced by an optomotor visual stimulus, and the yaw torque produced by the tethered animals was measured in open-loop conditions. Our main results suggest that the yaw torque oscillations in both P. clarkii and A. leptodactylus are related to the movement of outer leg 4 (i.e. leg 4 on the outside of the turn). That is, the peaks in the yaw torque occur, on average, in synchrony with the power stroke of outer leg 4. When comparing the results of this open-loop experiment on P. clarkii with results previously obtained for curve walking in untethered individuals of the same species, we found a much higher variability in leg coordination in the open-loop situation. Similarly, here we did not find the same level of synchrony in the tripod (formed by outer leg 4 and inner legs 2 and 5) observed during untethered free walking. Therefore, we suggest that tethered conditions may diminish the need for stability and thus allow outer leg 4 to produce a body rotation regardless of the leg stepping configuration. The characteristics of leg 4 are in line with its major role in turning. According to previous studies, legs 4 provide the largest force and the largest step amplitude during walking, and their force includes both a pulling and a pushing component which can facilitate the control of turning. Although it is apparent that outer leg 4 is not the only leg that can produce an inward yaw torque, its major role in modulating the yaw torque suggests that there may be a specific, centrally generated control of outer leg 4 during curve walking in crayfish.},

abstract = {We present an untethered, electrostatic, MEMS micro-robot, with dimensions of 60 &mu;m by 250 &mu;m by 10 &mu;m. The device consists of a curved, cantilevered steering arm, mounted on an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA). These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate. Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace. These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error of less than 3.7&deg;/mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176 &mu;m, and achieve speeds of over 200 &mu;m/sec with an average step size as small as 12 nm. They have been shown to operate open-loop for distances exceeding 35 cm without failure, and can be controlled through teleoperation to navigate complex paths. The devices were fabricated through a multiuser surface micromachining process, and were postprocessed to add a patterned layer of tensile chromium, which curls the steering arms upward. After sacrificial release, the devices were transferred with a vacuum microprobe to the electrical grid for testing. This grid consists of a silicon substrate coated with 13-&mu;m microfabricated electrodes, arranged in an interdigitated fashion with 2-&mu;m spaces. The electrodes are insulated by a layer of electron-beam-evaporated zirconium dioxide, so that devices placed on top of the electrodes will experience an electrostatic force in response to an applied voltage. Control waveforms are broadcast to the device through the capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response of the device body. Hysteresis in the system allows on-board storage of n=2 bits of state information in response to these electrical signals. The presence of on-board state information within the device itself allows each of the two device subsystems (USDA and steering arm) to be individually addressed and controlled- . We describe this communication and control strategy and show necessary and sufficient conditions for voltage-selective actuation of all 2n system states, both for our devices (n=2), and for the more general case (where n is larger.).},

abstract = {Evolutionary robotics applies the selection, variation, and heredity principles of natural evo-lution to the design of robots with embodied intelligence. It can be considered as a subfield of robotics that aims to create more robust and adaptive robots. A pivotal feature of the evo-lutionary approach is that it considers the whole robot at once, and enables the exploitation of robot features in a holistic manner. Evolutionary robotics can also be seen as an innova-tive approach to the study of evolution based on a new kind of experimentalism. The use of robots as a substrate can help to address questions that are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate through computer simulations or biological studies. In this paper, we consider the main achievements of evolutionary robotics, focusing particularly on its contributions to both engineering and biology. We briefly elaborate on methodological issues, review some of the most interesting findings, and discuss important open issues and promising avenues for future work.},

abstract = {Planning locomotion trajectories for legged microrobots is challenging because of their complex morphology, high frequency passive dynamics, and discontinuous contact interactions with their environment. Consequently, such research is often driven by time-consuming experimental methods. As an alternative, we present a framework for systematically modeling, planning, and controlling legged microrobots. We develop a three-dimensional dynamic model of a 1.5 gram quadrupedal microrobot with complexity (e.g., number of degrees of freedom) similar to larger-scale legged robots. We then adapt a recently developed variational contact-implicit trajectory optimization method to generate feasible whole-body locomotion plans for this microrobot, and we demonstrate that these plans can be tracked with simple joint-space controllers. We plan and execute periodic gaits at multiple stride frequencies and on various surfaces. These gaits achieve high per-cycle velocities, including a maximum of 10.87 mm/cycle, which is 15% faster than previously measured velocities for this microrobot. Furthermore, we plan and execute a vertical jump of 9.96 mm, which is 78% of the microrobot's center-of-mass height. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end demonstration of planning and tracking whole-body dynamic locomotion on a millimeter-scale legged microrobot.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. We present an off-board phase estimator and controller for leg position near the resonance of the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot's (HAMR) two degree-of-freedom transmission. This control system is a first step towards leveraging the significant increase in stride length at transmission resonance for faster and more efficient locomotion. We experimentally characterize HAMR's transmission and determine that actuator phase is a sufficient proxy for leg phase across the range of useful operating frequencies (1-120Hz). An estimator is developed to determine actuator phase using off-board position sensors and it converges within a cycle on average. We also fit a nonlinear dynamic model of the transmission to the experimental data, and utilize the model to determine a suitable open-loop resonant leg trajectory and define feed forward control inputs. This resonant (100Hz) trajectory is theoretically 50% more efficient than pre-resonant high speed running trajectories. The controller converges to this trajectory in 0.05 ± 0.02 seconds (5.3 ± 2.4 cycles) in air, and in 0.05 ± 0.01 seconds (4.7 ± 0.6 cycles) under perturbations that approximate ground contact.},

Material composition is defined based on voxel resolution and used to fabricate a design object with locally varying material stiffness, aiming to satisfy the design objective. In this workflow voxel resolution is set by the printer's native resolution, eliminating the need for slicing and path planning. Controlling geometry and material property variation at the resolution of the printer provides significantly greater control over structure-property-function relationships. To demonstrate the utility of the bitmap printing approach we apply it to the design of a customized prosthetic socket. Pressure-sensing elements are concurrently fabricated with the socket, providing possibilities for evaluation of the socket's fit. The level of control demonstrated in this study cannot be achieved using traditional CAD tools and volume-based AM workflows, implying that new CAD workflows must be developed in order to enable designers to harvest the capabilities of AM.},

abstract = {DNA nanotechnology exploits the programmable specificity afforded by base-pairing to produce self-assembling macromolecular objects of custom shape. For building megadalton-scale DNA nanostructures, a long 'scaffold' strand can be employed to template the assembly of hundreds of oligonucleotide 'staple' strands into a planar antiparallel array of cross-linked helices. We recently adapted this 'scaffolded DNA origami' method to producing 3D shapes formed as pleated layers of double helices constrained to a honeycomb lattice. However, completing the required design steps can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Here we present caDNAno, an open-source software package with a graphical user interface that aids in the design of DNA sequences for folding 3D honeycomb-pleated shapes A series of rectangular-block motifs were designed, assembled, and analyzed to identify a well-behaved motif that could serve as a building block for future studies. The use of caDNAno significantly reduces the effort required to design 3D DNA-origami structures. The software is available at http://cadnano.org/, along with example designs and video tutorials demonstrating their construction. The source code is released under the MIT license.},

abstract = {Molecular self-assembly offers a 'bottom-up' route to fabrication with subnanometre precision of complex structures from simple components. DNA has proved to be a versatile building block for programmable construction of such objects, including two-dimensional crystals, nanotubes, and three-dimensional wireframe nanopolyhedra. Templated self-assembly of DNA into custom two-dimensional shapes on the megadalton scale has been demonstrated previously with a multiple-kilobase 'scaffold strand' that is folded into a flat array of antiparallel helices by interactions with hundreds of oligonucleotide 'staple strands'. Here we extend this method to building custom three-dimensional shapes formed as pleated layers of helices constrained to a honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate the design and assembly of nanostructures approximating six shapes-monolith, square nut, railed bridge, genie bottle, stacked cross, slotted cross-with precisely controlled dimensions ranging from 10 to 100 nm. We also show hierarchical assembly of structures such as homomultimeric linear tracks and heterotrimeric wireframe icosahedra. Proper assembly requires week-long folding times and calibrated monovalent and divalent cation concentrations. We anticipate that our strategy for self-assembling custom three-dimensional shapes will provide a general route to the manufacture of sophisticated devices bearing features on the nanometre scale.},

abstract = {Salmonid fishes (trout, salmon and relatives) have served as a model system for study of the mechanics of aquatic animal locomotion, yet little is known about the function of non-axial propulsors in this major taxonomic group. In this study we examine the behavioral and hydromechanical repertoire of the paired pectoral fins of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, performing both steady rectilinear swimming and unsteady maneuvering locomotion. A combination of kinematic analysis and quantitative flow visualization (using digital particle image velocimetry) enables identification of the propulsive roles played by pectoral fin motions. During constant-speed swimming (0.5 and 1.0 body length s–1), the pectoral fins remain adducted against the body. These fins are actively recruited, however, for a variety of maneuvering behaviors, including station holding in still water (hovering), low-speed (i.e. non-fast-start) turning, and rapid deceleration of the body during braking. Despite having a shallow pectoral-fin base orientation (the plesiomorphic teleost condition), trout are capable of rotating the fin base over 30° during maneuvering, which affords the fin an impressive degree of kinematic versatility. When hovering, the pectoral fins are depressed$\$r$\$nbeneath the body and twisted along their long axes to allow anteroposterior sculling. During turning and braking, the fins undergo spanwise rotation in the opposite direction and exhibit mediolateral and dorsoventral excursions. Water velocity fields and calculated momentum flows in the wake of the pectoral fins reveal that positive thrust is not generated during maneuvering, except during the retraction half-stroke of hovering. Relatively large laterally directed fluid force (mean 2.7mN) is developed during turning, whose reaction powers yawing rotation of the body (4–41 ° s–1). During deceleration, the wake-force line of action falls below the center of mass of the body, and this result supports a long- standing mechanical model of braking by fishes with ventrally positioned paired fins. Despite its traditional categorization as a propulsor of limited functional importance, the salmoniform pectoral fin exhibits a diverse locomotor repertoire comparable to that of higher teleostean fishes.},

abstract = {Quantifying the locomotor forces experienced by swimming fishes represents a significant challenge because direct measurements of force applied to the aquatic medium are not feasible. However, using the technique of digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), it is possible to quantify the effect of fish fins on water movement and hence to estimate momentum transfer from the animal to the fluid. We used DPIV to visualize water flow in the wake of the pectoral fins of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) swimming at speeds of 0.5-1.5 L s-1, where L is total body length. Velocity fields quantified in three perpendicular planes in the wake of the fins allowed three-dimensional reconstruction of downstream vortex structures. At low swimming speed (0.5 L s-1), vorticity is shed by each fin during the downstroke and stroke reversal to generate discrete, roughly symmetrical, vortex rings of near-uniform circulation with a central jet of high-velocity flow. At and above the maximum sustainable labriform swimming speed of 1.0 L s-1, additional vorticity appears on the upstroke, indicating the production of linked pairs of rings by each fin. Fluid velocity measured in the vicinity of the fin indicates that substantial spanwise flow during the downstroke may occur as vortex rings are formed. The forces exerted by the fins on the water in three dimensions were calculated from vortex ring orientation and momentum. Mean wake-derived thrust (11.1 mN) and lift (3.2 mN) forces produced by both fins per stride at 0.5 L s-1 were found to match closely empirically determined counter-forces of body drag and weight. Medially directed reaction forces were unexpectedly large, averaging 125% of the thrust force for each fin. Such large inward forces and a deep body that isolates left- and right-side vortex rings are predicted to aid maneuverability. The observed force balance indicates that DPIV can be used to measure accurately large-scale vorticity in the wake of swimming fishes and is therefore a valuable means of studying unsteady flows produced by animals moving through fluids.},

abstract = {Two methods have been used extensively to model resting contact for rigid body simulation. The first approach, the penalty method, applies virtual springs to surfaces in contact to minimize interpenetration. This method, as typically implemented, results in oscillatory behavior and considerable penetration. The second approach, based on formulating resting contact as a linear complementarity problem, determines the resting contact forces analytically to prevent interpenetration. The analytical method exhibits expected-case polynomial complexity in the number of contact points, and may fail to find a solution in polynomial time when friction is modeled. We present a fast penalty method that minimizes oscillatory behavior and leads to little penetration during resting contact; our method compares favorably to the analytical method with regard to these two measures, while exhibiting much faster performance both asymptotically and empirically.},

abstract = {In subterranean species where excavation is energetically expensive, efficient spatial navigation is vital to reducing the costs of locating important resources such as food and mates. While spatial navigational ability is positively correlated with sociality in subterranean mammals, we have a less clear understanding of the role of habitat complexity on navigational ability. We tested spatial navigational ability and memory in 12-18-month captive Natal mole-rats (Cryptomys hottentotus natalensis) maintained in a simple environment with no environmental enrichment and newly captured wild individuals from natural, complex burrow systems. In maze trials, mole-rats captured freshly from the wild made significantly fewer navigational errors, were more likely to successfully navigate the maze, travelled shorter distances and as a consequence, completed the maze in less time. Male mole-rats from both experimental treatments were more likely to complete the maze than females. Memory retention of the maze was tested on day two, seven, 30 and 60, respectively. The results were variable, although both groups showed a significant memory retention 60 days after testing. Our results highlight the potential importance of the environment (microhabitat complexity) on spatial cognitive performance in mole-rats.},

abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is the process of 3D printing objects from melted plastic filament. The hot plastic exits a nozzle and fuses with the part just below, adding a layer of material to the object being formed. However, filament can only be deposited on top of an existing surface. Therefore, overhangs require a disposable support structure to be printed, temporarily supporting the threads of plastic that would otherwise hang in empty space. Existing techniques for support generation fall into two categories: The first allow for very reliable prints by enclosing the bottom of the object in a dense structure, at the expense of increased material usage and build times. The second generate thin hierarchical structures connecting to the surface in a sparse number of points. This uses less material, at the expense of reliability: the part might become unstable, the structure itself may become difficult to print, the bottom surface quality degrades. The user therefore has to correct the structure and its parameters for each new object. We propose to exploit the ability of FFF printers to print bridges across gaps. Since bridges are always supported by pillars at their extremities, they are both stronger and more stable than hierarchical tree structures. Our technique first selects the points to support based on overhang and part stability during the entire print process. It then optimizes for a printable scaffolding composed of bridges and vertical pillars, supporting all points. The result is an automated support generation technique using little material while ensuring fine surface quality and stability during the printing process.},

The central contribution of this work is the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM), computed in real-time, in the control algorithm. The FEM based simulation computes the nonlinear deformations of the robots at interactive rates. The model is completed by Lagrange multipliers at the actuation zones and at the end-effector position. A reduced compliance matrix is built in order to deal with the necessary inversion of the model. Then, an iterative algorithm uses this compliance matrix to find the contribution of the actuators (force and/or position) that will deform the structure so that the terminal end of the robot follows a given position. Additional constraints, like rigid or deformable obstacles, or the internal characteristics of the actuators are integrated in the control algorithm. We illustrate our method using simulated examples of both serial and parallel structures and we validate it on a real 3D soft robot made of silicone.},

Three actuators independently control the top knuckle of each finger. The lower knuckles of the finger are passively coupled to the top knuckle. We place a pair of torsion springs between the motor housing and the hand chassis. By measuring the deflection of these springs, we can determine the acting force of the actuator. The springs also provide compliance in the finger and protect the motor gearbox from high impact shocks. Our novel actuators, combined with embedded control electronics, allow for a compact and dexterous hand design that is well suited to humanoid manipulation research. 1},

This paper presents a pseudo-rigid-body model for initially curved pinned-pinned segments that undergo large, nonlinear deflections. The model approximates the segment as three rigid members joined by pin joints. Torsional springs placed at the joints model the segment's stiffness. This model has been validated by fabricating several such segments from a variety of different materials. Testing of the force-deflection behavior of these segments verified the accuracy of the model.},

abstract = {Understanding the prevalence of disability is important for public health programs to be able to address the needs of persons with disabilities. Beginning in 2013, to measure disability prevalence by functional type, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), added five questions to identify disability in vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent living. CDC analyzed data from the 2013 BRFSS to assess overall prevalence of any disability, as well as specific types of disability among noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. Across all states, disabilities in mobility and cognition were the most frequently reported types. State-level prevalence of each disability type ranged from 2.7% to 8.1% (vision); 6.9% to 16.8% (cognition); 8.5% to 20.7% (mobility); 1.9% to 6.2% (self-care) and 4.2% to 10.8% (independent living). A higher prevalence of any disability was generally seen among adults living in states in the South and among women (24.4%) compared with men (19.8%). Prevalences of any disability and disability in mobility were higher among older age groups. These are the first data on functional disability types available in a state-based health survey. This information can help public health programs identify the prevalence of and demographic characteristics associated with different disability types among U.S. adults and better target appropriate interventions to reduce health disparities.},

abstract = {A full derivation is presented for the vortex theory of hovering flight outlined in preliminary reports. The theory relates the lift produced by flapping wings to the induced velocity and power of the wake. Suitable forms of the momentum theory are combined with the vortex approach to reduce the mathematical complexity as much as possible. Vorticity is continuously shed from the wings in sympathy with changes in wing circulation. The vortex sheet shed during a half-stroke convects downwards with the induced velocity field, and should be approximately planar at the end of a half-stroke. Vorticity within the sheet will roll up into complicated vortex rings, but the rate of this process is unknown. The exact state of the sheet is not crucial to the theory, however, since the impulse and energy of the vortex sheet do not change as it rolls up, and the theory is derived on the assumption that the extent of roll-up is negligible. The force impulse required to generate the sheet is derived from the vorticity of the sheet, and the mean wing lift is equal to that impulse divided by the period of generation. This method of calculating the mean lift is suitable for unsteady aerodynamic lift mechanisms as well as the quasi-steady mechanism. The relation between the mean lift and the impulse of the resulting vortex sheet is used to develop a conceptual artifice - a pulsed actuator disc - that approximates closely the net effect of the complicated lift forces produced in hovering. T he disc periodically applies a pressure impulse over some defined area, and is a generalized form of the Froude actuator disc from propeller theory. The pulsed disc provides a convenient link between circulatory lift and the powerful momentum and vortex analyses of the wake. The induced velocity and power of the wake are derived in stages, starting with the simple Rankine-Froude theory for the wake produced by a Froude disc applying a uniform, continuous pressure to the air. The wake model is then improved by considering a ‘modified' Froude disc exerting a continuous, but non-uniform pressure. This step provides a spatial correction factor for the Rankine-Froude theory, by taking into account variations in pressure and circulation over the disc area. Finally, the wake produced by a pulsed Froude disc is analysed, and a temporal correction factor is derived for the periodic application of spatially uniform pressures. Both correction factors are generally small, and can be treated as independent perturbations of the Rankine-Froude model. Thus the corrections can be added linearly to obtain the total correction for the general case of a pulsed actuator disc with spatial and temporal pressure variations. The theory is compared with Rayner's vortex theory for hovering flight. Under identical test conditions, numerical results from the two theories agree to within 3%. Rayner presented approximations from his results to be used when applying his theory to hovering animals. These approximations are not consistent with my theory or with classical propeller theory, and reasons for the discrepancy are suggested.},

abstract = {The nature of manual manipulation of objects is discussed. It is argued that a functional distinction should be made between palmar grips which immobilise an object in the hand, and digital patterns which permit manipulation. Such a distinction is separate from any anatomically defined power and precision configurations. Manipulative hand movements may be grouped into three classes, based on differences between sequenced patterns of movement and synergies, the latter being further subdivided into simple and reciprocal patterns. Within each of the three classes, a number of individual movement patterns are described. These differ mainly in the number of digits involved and the way in which the thumb is employed. The classification is concerned with movements of the digits directed at manipulating an object within the hand. It is not concerned with movements of the hand as a whole, using the wrist or more proximal joints, while holding an immobilised object.},

abstract = {Shape change is a prevalent function apparent in a diverse set of natural structures, including seed dispersal units, climbing plants and carnivorous plants. Many of these natural materials change shape by using cellulose microfibrils at specific orientations to anisotropically restrict the swelling/shrinkage of their organic matrices upon external stimuli. This is in contrast to the material-specific mechanisms found in synthetic shape-memory systems. Here we propose a robust and universal method to replicate this unusual shape-changing mechanism of natural systems in artificial bioinspired composites. The technique is based upon the remote control of the orientation of reinforcing inorganic particles within the composite using a weak external magnetic field. Combining this reinforcement orientational control with swellable/shrinkable polymer matrices enables the creation of composites whose shape change can be programmed into the material's microstructure rather than externally imposed. Such bioinspired approach can generate composites with unusual reversibility, twisting effects and site-specific programmable shape changes.},

The study focuses on the conditions at the tunnel face that determine particle removal methods, digging rate, the development of branches, and tun- neling patterns. Analytical and numerical models provide particle-level insight into the experimental observations and help identify the causal links that relate ants digging perfor- mance and nest geometric patterns with the properties of the granular medium such as grain size, moisture, and packing density. Results highlight ants' exceptional ability to sense the prevailing geomechanical conditions in tunnels, and to adapt excavation strategies, transportmethods and tunneling patterns to those conditions, within their inherent size and strength limitations. The resulting tunnel structure emerges as a mechanically-convenient and energy-efficient topology based on local information gather by ants along the tunnel and at the tunnel face.},

abstract = {We designed a robotic fish caudal fin with six individually moveable fin rays based on the tail of the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Previous fish robotic tail designs have loosely resembled the caudal fin of fishes, but have not incorporated key biomechanical components such as fin rays that can be controlled to generate complex tail conformations and motion programs similar to those seen in the locomotor repertoire of live fishes. We used this robotic caudal fin to test for the effects of fin ray stiffness, frequency and motion program on the generation of thrust and lift forces. Five different sets of fin rays were constructed to be from 150 to 2000 times the stiffness of biological fin rays, appropriately scaled for the robotic caudal fin, which had linear dimensions approximately four times larger than those of adult bluegill sunfish. Five caudal fin motion programs were identified as kinematic features of swimming behaviors in live bluegill sunfish, and were used to program the kinematic repertoire: flat movement of the entire fin, cupping of the fin, W-shaped fin motion, fin undulation and rolling movements. The robotic fin was flapped at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 Hz. All fin motions produced force in the thrust direction, and the cupping motion produced the most thrust in almost all cases. Only the undulatory motion produced lift force of similar magnitude to the thrust force. More compliant fin rays produced lower peak magnitude forces than the stiffer fin rays at the same frequency. Thrust and lift forces increased with increasing flapping frequency; thrust was maximized by the 500× stiffness fin rays and lift was maximized by the 1000× stiffness fin rays.},

There are notable differences among the three locomotor modes with respect to mid-air postures and aerodynamics, yet it is unclear whether variation should also be expected during the launch phase of locomotion. To address this question, launch kinematic profiles were compared in leaping (Tamias striatus), parachuting (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and gliding (Glaucomys volans) squirrels. Animals were filmed launching to the ground from a platform using high-speed video. Statistical comparisons among taxa indicated that only six out of 23 variables were significantly different among the three species. Two were associated with tail kinematics and were a consequence of tail morphology. Two were forelimb-related and discriminated gliding from non-gliding taxa. The remaining two variables were performance attributes, indicating significant variation among the species in take-off velocity and horizontal range. The absence of significant differences in hindlimb kinematics indicates that propulsion is essentially identical in leaping, parachuting and gliding squirrels.},

abstract = {Trotting and hopping animals use muscles, tendons and ligaments to store and return elastic energy as they bounce along the ground. We examine how the musculoskeletal spring system operates at different speeds and in animals of different sizes. We model trotting and hopping as a simple spring-mass system which consists of a leg spring and a mass. We find that the stiffness of the leg spring (k(leg)) is nearly independent of speed in dogs, goats, horses and red kangaroos. As these animals trot or hop faster, the leg spring sweeps a greater angle during the stance phase, and the vertical excursion of the center of mass during the ground contact phase decreases. The combination of these changes to the spring system causes animals to bounce off the ground more quickly at higher speeds. Analysis of a wide size range of animals (0.1-140 kg) at equivalent speeds reveals that larger animals have stiffer leg springs (k(leg) [symbol: see text] M0.67, where M is body mass), but that the angle swept by the leg spring is nearly independent of body mass. As a result, the resonant period of vertical vibration of the spring-mass system is longer in larger animals. The length of time that the feet are in contact with the ground increases with body mass in nearly the same way as the resonant period of vertical vibration.},

abstract = {Lizards bend their trunks laterally with each step of locomotion and, as a result, their locomotion appears to be fundamentally different from mammalian locomotion. The goal of the present study was to determine whether lizards use the same two basic gaits as other legged animals or whether they use a mechanically unique gait due to lateral trunk bending. Force platform and kinematic measurements revealed that two species of lizards, Coleonyx variegatus and Eumeces skiltonianus, used two basic gaits similar to mammalian walking and trotting gaits. In both gaits, the kinetic energy fluctuations due to lateral movements of the center of mass were less than 5% of the total external mechanical energy fluctuations. In the walking gait, both species vaulted over their stance limbs like inverted pendulums. The fluctuations in kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of the center of mass were approximately 180°out of phase. The lizards conserved as much as 51% of the external mechanical energy required for locomotion by the inverted pendulum mechanism. Both species also used a bouncing gait, similar to mammalian trotting, in which the fluctuations in kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of the center of mass were nearly exactly in phase. The mass-specific external mechanical work required to travel 1 m (1.5Jkg-1) was similar to that for other legged animals. Thus, in spite of marked lateral bending of the trunk, the mechanics of lizard locomotion is similar to the mechanics of locomotion in other legged animals.},

The grasp information acquired through these two sources is useful for both sensing the errors and controlling the fingers.

abstract = {In the Cobotic Hand Controller, we have introduced an admittance display that can render very high impedances (up to its own structural stiffness). This is due to its use of infinitely variable transmissions. While admittance displays typically excel at rendering high impedances, the incorporation of infinitely variable transmissions in the Cobotic Hand Controller allows the stable display of a wide dynamic range, including low impedances. The existence of a display that excels at rendering high-impedance constraints, but has high-fidelity control of low impedances tangent to those constraints, has led us to describe an admittance control architecture not often examined in the haptics community. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive approach that enables rendering of rigid motion constraints while simultaneously preserving the physical integrity of the intended inertial dynamics tangent to those constraints. This is in contrast to conventional impedance-control algorithms that focus primarily on rendering reaction forces along contact normals with constraints. We present this algorithm here, which is general to all admittance displays, and report on its implementation with the Cobotic Hand Controller. We offer examples of rigid bodies and linkages subject to holonomic and/or nonholonomic constraints},

The method is applicable to open-loop kinematic chains containing revolute and prismatic joints. The algorithm is based on recursive formulas involving quantities called articulated-body inertias, which represent the inertia properties of collections of rigid bodies connected together by joints allowing constrained relative motion between the bodies. A new, matrix-based notation is introduced to represent articulated-body inertias and other spatial quantities. This notation is used to develop the algorithm, and results in a compact representation of the equations. The new algorithm has a computational requirement that varies linearly with the number of joints, and its efficiency is compared with other published algorithms.},

abstract = {Deficiencies in engineering education have been exhaustively enumerated in recent years. Engineering schools and professors have been told by countless panels and blue-ribbon commissions and, in the United States, by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology that we must strengthen our coverage of fundamentals; teach more about " real-world " engineering design and operations, including quality management; cover more material in frontier areas of engineering; offer more and better instruction in both oral and written communication skills and teamwork skills; provide training in critical and creative thinking skills and problem-solving methods; produce graduates who are conversant with engineering ethics and the connections between technology and society; and reduce the number of hours in the engineering curriculum so that the average student can complete it in four years. 1 This is an impressive wish list—especially when the last item is included—that cannot possibly be fulfilled using the approach to educating engineers that has predominated in the past 50 years. If, for example, courses continue to be confined to single subjects (heat transfer in one course, thermodynamics in another, environmental engineering in another, technical writing in another, etc.) it will take a six-or seven-year curriculum to produce engineers who have the desired proficiency in the fundamentals and are conversant with methods of modern engineering practice, culturally literate, and skilled in communication. Moreover, if students are assigned only well-defined convergent problems, they will never gain the skills needed to tackle and solve challenging multidisciplinary problems that call for critical judgment and creativity. Finally, even if nothing new is added to the existing curriculum, confining it to four years will be almost impossible unless more efficient and effective ways to cover the material can be found. The reality is that better teaching methods exist. The literature in general education, technical education, and educational psychology is replete with methods that have been shown to facilitate learning more effectively than the traditional single-discipline lecturing approach. Unfortunately, these developments have so far had relatively little impact on mainstream engineering education. Although their content has changed in some ways and the students use calculators and computers instead of slide rules, many engineering classes in 1999 are taught in exactly the same way that engineering classes in 1959 were taught.},

Felton et al. made complex self-folding robots from flat templates. Such robots could potentially be sent through a collapsed building or tunnels and then assemble themselves autonomously into their final functional form. Silverberg et al. created a mechanical metamaterial that was folded into a tessellated pattern of unit cells. These cells reversibly switched between soft and stiff states, causing large, controllable changes to the way the material responded to being squashed. Science, this issue p. 644, p. 647; see also p. 623 Origami can turn a sheet of paper into complex three-dimensional shapes, and similar folding techniques can produce structures and mechanisms. To demonstrate the application of these techniques to the fabrication of machines, we developed a crawling robot that folds itself. The robot starts as a flat sheet with embedded electronics, and transforms autonomously into a functional machine. To accomplish this, we developed shape-memory composites that fold themselves along embedded hinges. We used these composites to recreate fundamental folded patterns, derived from computational origami, that can be extrapolated to a wide range of geometries and mechanisms. This origami-inspired robot can fold itself in 4 minutes and walk away without human intervention, demonstrating the potential both for complex self-folding machines and autonomous, self-controlled assembly. Origami techniques are used to develop crawling robots that self-fold from flat-pack designs. Origami techniques are used to develop crawling robots that self-fold from flat-pack designs.},

abstract = {Transmissions play a vital role in machines by transforming the torque and speed of a motor into a desired output. They are often necessary for operating a motor at peak efficiency or power. The majority of variable transmissions are mechanically complex, large, and expensive, which limits scalability and is often cost prohibitive. As an alternative, we propose an origami-wheel design that is capable of varying its own transmission ratio between motor torque and ground reaction force, effectively creating a passive, continuously variable transmission. The wheel responds to an increase in torque by reducing its radius through the spring-like properties of the origami structure, increasing the force applied by the wheel to the ground. We demonstrate that the wheel is able to match the speed of a 55 mm fixed-radius wheel when unloaded, and can also tow loads as high as a 25 mm wheel without stalling. This design could be used to provide smaller, cheaper robots with an effective means to vary their output while maintaining motor efficiency.},

@article{Fernandes2012,
abstract = {Self-folding broadly refers to self-assembly processes wherein thin films or interconnected planar templates curve, roll-up or fold into three dimensional (3D) structures such as cylindrical tubes, spirals, corrugated sheets or polyhedra. The process has been demonstrated with metallic, semiconducting and polymeric films and has been used to curve tubes with diameters as small as 2. nm and fold polyhedra as small as 100. nm, with a surface patterning resolution of 15. nm. Self-folding methods are important for drug delivery applications since they provide a means to realize 3D, biocompatible, all-polymeric containers with well-tailored composition, size, shape, wall thickness, porosity, surface patterns and chemistry. Self-folding is also a highly parallel process, and it is possible to encapsulate or self-load therapeutic cargo during assembly. A variety of therapeutic cargos such as small molecules, peptides, proteins, bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells have been encapsulated in self-folded polymeric containers. In this review, we focus on self-folding of all-polymeric containers. We discuss the mechanistic aspects of self-folding of polymeric containers driven by differential stresses or surface tension forces, the applications of self-folding polymers in drug delivery and we outline future challenges. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {When mammals run, the overall musculoskeletal system behaves as a single linear "leg spring". We used force platform and kinematic measurements to determine whether leg spring stiffness (k(leg)) is adjusted to accommodate changes in surface stiffness (ksurf) when humans hoop in place, a good experimental model for examining adjustments to k(leg) in bouncing gaits. We found that k(leg) was greatly increased to accommodate surfaces of lower stiffnesses. The series combination of k(leg) and ksurf [total stiffness (ktot)] was independent of ksurf at a given hopping frequency. For example, when humans hopped at a frequency of 2 Hz, they tripled their k(leg) on the least stiff surface (ksurf = 26.1 kN/m; k(leg) = 53.3 kN/m) compared with the most stiff surface (ksurf = 35,000 kN/m; k(leg) = 17.8 kN/m). Values for ktot were not significantly different on the least stiff surface (16.7 kN/m) and the most stiff surface (17.8 kN/m). Because of the k(leg) adjustment, many aspects of the hopping mechanics (e.g., ground-contact time and center of mass vertical displacement) remained remarkably similar despite a >1,000-fold change in ksurf. This study provides insight into how k(leg) adjustments can allow similar locomotion mechanics on the variety of terrains encountered by runners in the natural world.},

abstract = {The theory of cortical localization of function holds that different cerebral cortical territories serve different functions, such as vision and language. This theory began to be entertained in the mid-1700s, but it had no impact until Gall made it central to his thinking in the early 1800s. Gall's organology, with its emphasis on cranial bumps, soon fell into disrepute, but in the decades that followed Bouillaud, Aubertin, and Broca advanced the concept by turning to clinical cases of speech loss, and in 1870 Fritsch and Hitzig demonstrated its validity, studying motor functions with animals. The theory of cortical localization of function served as a guiding factor in changing the practice of neurology, and clinicians encountered new material supportive of the doctrine. Surgical neurology, anatomy, and physiology also supported the new way of thinking, contributing to a better understanding of the functional organization of the cerebral cortex and to clinical neurology.},

abstract = {Various robotic applications including surgical instruments, wearable robots and autonomous mobile robots are often constrained with strict design requirements on high degrees of freedom (DoF) and minimal volume and weight. An intuitive design to meet these contradictory requirements is to embed locking mechanism in under actuated robotic manipulators to direct the actuation from a single and remote source to drive different joints on demand. Mechanical clutches do serve such purposes but often are bulky and require auxiliary mechanism making it difficult to justify the high cost adding the additional DoF, especially in cm scale. Here, we introduce an under-actuated robotic arm with shape memory polymer (SMP) joints. Through controlling the temperature, the stiffness of the joints can be adjusted and selected joints will be activated while the rest are fixed in their position. The presented prototype can control the joints independently with a coupled actuation from two stepper motors. Since we have redundant DoFs in the arm, there can be more than one configuration to reach a given position. We use a probabilistic technique to determine the optimum configuration with the minimum number of active joints that can yield the desired posture. In this paper, we report on the performance of the proposed design for the hardware and the configuration planner.},

The unique hardware of the Robogami and its submillimeter thick construction enable diverse transformations as those achievable by the paper origami. The presented Robogami shows the first fully integrated version that has all the essential components including its controller within a thin sheet. Construction of this robot is possible via precise, repeatable, and low cost planar fabrication methods often reserved for microscale fabrications.

Here, we propose a compact origami-based design in which we can modulate the material stiffness of the joints and thereby control the stable configurations and the overall stiffness in an underactuated robot. The robotic origami, robogami, design uses multiple functional layers in nominally two-dimensional robots to achieve the desired functionality. To control the stiffness of the structure, we adjust the elastic modulus of a shape memory polymer using an embedded customized stretchable heater. We study the actuation of a robogami finger with three joints and determine its stable configurations and contact forces at different stiffness settings. We monitor the configuration of the finger using feedback from customized curvature sensors embedded in each joint. A scaled down version of the design is used in a two-fingered gripper and different grasp modes are achieved by activating different sets of joints. &copy; 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design of a 21 degree-of-freedom, nine degree-of-actuation, gas-actuated arm prosthesis for transhumeral amputees. The arm incorporates a direct-drive elbow and three degree-of-freedom wrist, in addition to a 17 degree-of-freedom underactuated hand effected by five actuators. The anthropomorphic device includes full position and force sensing capability for each actuated degree of freedom and integrates a monopropellant-powered gas generator to provide on-board power for untethered operation. Design considerations addressed in this paper include the sizing of pneumatic actuators based on the requisite output energy at each joint; the development of small low-power servovalves for use with hot/cold gases; the design of compact joints with integrated position sensing; and the packaging of the actuators, on-board power, and skeletal structure within the volumetric envelope of a normal human forearm and elbow. The resulting arm prototype approaches the dexterous manipulation capabilities of its anatomical counterpart while delivering approximately 50% of the force and power output of an average human arm.},

abstract = {Evolutionary patterns of intrinsic caudal musculature in ray-finned fishes show that fine control of the dorsal lobe of the tail evolved first, followed by the ability to control the ventral lobe. This progression of increasing differentiation of musculature suggests specialization of caudal muscle roles. Fine control of fin elements is probably responsible for the range of fin conformations observed during different maneuvering behaviors. Here, we examine the kinematics of the caudal fin and the motor activity of the intrinsic caudal musculature during kick-and-glide, braking and backing maneuvers, and compare these data with our previous work on the function of the caudal fin during steady swimming. Kick-and-glide maneuvers consisted of large-amplitude, rapid lateral excursion of the tail fin, followed by forward movement of the fish with the caudal fin rays adducted to reduce surface area and with the tail held in line with the body. Just before the kick, the flexors dorsalis and ventralis, hypochordal longitudinalis, infracarinalis and supracarinalis showed strong activity. During braking, the dorsal and ventral lobes of the tail moved in opposite directions, forming an ;S'-shape, accompanied by strong activity in the interradialis muscles. During backing up, the ventral lobe initiated a dorsally directed wave along the distal edge of the caudal fin. The relative timing of the intrinsic caudal muscles varied between maneuvers, and their activation was independent of the activity of the red muscle of the axial myomeres in the caudal region. There was no coupling of muscle activity duration and electromyographic burst intensity in the intrinsic caudal muscles during maneuvers, as was observed in previous work on steady swimming. Principal-component analysis produced four components that cumulatively explained 73.6% of the variance and segregated kick-and-glide, braking and backing maneuvers from each other and from steady swimming. The activity patterns of the intrinsic caudal muscles during maneuvering suggest motor control independent from myotomal musculature, and specialization of individual muscles for specific kinematic roles.},

We argue that robots generate valuable insight into the function of nervous systems, which is intimately linked to behaviour and embodiment, and that brain-inspired algorithms and devices give robots life-like capabilities.},

abstract = {— This paper introduces a novel robot which can run on the surface of water in a manner similar to basilisk lizards. Previous studies on the lizards themselves have characterized their method of propulsion and their means of staying afloat. By slapping and stroking their feet into the water, the lizard effects a momentum transfer which provides both forward thrust and lift. The design of a biomimetic robot utilizing similar principles is discussed, modeled, and prototyped. Functionally, the robot uses a pair of identical four bar mechanisms, with a 180 o phase shift to achieve bipedal locomotion on the water's surface. Computational and experimental results are presented and reviewed with the focus being a maximization of the lift to power ratio. After optimization, two legged models can experimentally provide 12-15 g/W of lift while four legged models can provide 50 g/W of lift. This work opens the door for bipedal and quadrupedal robots to become ambulatory over both land and water, and represents a first step toward studies in amphibious stride patterns; step motions equally conducive to propulsion on water and land.},

abstract = {Beyond the Net, say Foster, Kesselman, and a host of impressive contributors, lies the Grid. While the Net allows users everywhere to share information, the Grid will allow users to share raw computing power. The goal is to put full supercomputing capabilities into the hands of anyone who needs it while providing for more efficient use of the supercomputers of tomorrow. The potential benefits to science, government, and business may well be beyond imagination. Foster and Kesselman have gathered together essays, proposals, and ruminations of more than 30 distinguished stars of the high-speed computing and networking world in order to do four things: make the case for developing computational grids, provide ideas on how such grids may be designed, demonstrate how the grids might be used, and point out the research still needed to make it happen. While the book was written to serve as a possible textbook in advanced networking, it makes fascinating reading for anyone interested in the future of network computing. The text covers Grid applications, the programming tools required, the services that will be provided, and an examination of Grid infrastructure. Despite being the work of so many authors, the chapters are logically arranged so that the knowledge needed to understand one chapter is provided by those that precede it. -Elizabeth Lewis The grid promises to fundamentally change the way we think about and use computing. This infrastructure will connect multiple regional and national computational grids, creating a universal source of pervasive and dependable computing power that supports dramatically new classes of applications. The Grid provides a clear vision of what computational grids are, why we need them, who will use them, and how they will be programmed.Inside The Grid Written by over 30 distinguished experts in high-performance computing and networking, including Francine Berman, Tom DeFanti, Jack Dongarra, Dennis Gannon, Roch Guerin, Ken Kennedy, Miron Livny, Paul Messina, Reagan Moore, Clifford Neuman, Larry Peterson, Jon Postel, and Daniel Reed. Edited by the winners of the prestigious 1998 Global Information Infrastructure Next Generation awards program characterized by U.S. Vice President Al Gore as "confirming our brightest hopes: that the positive uses of high technology will truly open up new opportunities for all Americans and improve our quality of life."

abstract = {With particular interest on total hip arthroplasty (THA), optimization of orthopedic prostheses is employed in this work to minimize the probability of implant failure or maximize prosthesis reliability. This goal is often identified with the reduction of stress concentrations at the interface between bone and these devices. However, aseptic loosening of the implant is mainly influenced by bone resorption phenomena revealed in some regions of the femur when a prosthesis is introduced. As a consequence, bone resorption appears due to stress shielding, that is to say the decrease of the stress level in the implanted femur caused by the significant load carrying of the prosthesis due to its higher stiffness.A maximum stiffness topological optimization-based (TO) strategy is utilized for non-linear static finite element (FE) analyses of the femurimplant assembly, with the goal of reducing stress shielding in the femur and to furnish guidelines for re-designing hip prostheses. This is accomplished by employing an extreme accuracy for both the three-dimensional reconstruction of the femur geometry and the material properties maps assigned as explicit functions of the local densities. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research was to improve body powered, voluntary closing (VC) prosthetic prehension. A prototype prehensor with variable mechanical advantage was fabricated and tested. The device operates at low mechanical advantage during sizing of an object to reduce cable excursion requirements. It shifts to high mechanical advantage during gripping to allow high prehensile forces to be generated with reduced cable tension. The prototype provides a mechanical advantage of 2.4, nearly five times that of conventional VC devices. The prototype also acts as a holding assist; after grip forces are applied, they can be maintained with a cable tension of only 3 lb (13.34N). Field testing indicated that the device performs well in many tasks. The mechanism allows greater range of motion while an object is grasped than standard voluntary closing prehensors. However, the device performed poorly in grasping very compliant objects. To address this problem, a switch has been incorporated into the prototype to allow it to be used in a free-wheel mode.},

The task has redundancies at many levels, allowing many possibilities for the selection of grasp points, the orientation and posture of the hand, the forces to be applied at each fingertip and the impedance properties of the hand. Despite this inherent complexity, humans perform object manipulation nearly effortlessly. This article presents experimental findings of how humans grasp and manipulate objects, and examines the compatibility of grasps selected for specific tasks. This is accomplished by looking at the velocity transmission and force transmission ellipsoids, which represent the transmission ratios of the corresponding quantity from the joints to the object, as well as the stiffness ellipsoid which represents the directional stiffness of the grasp. These ellipsoids allow visualization of the grasp Jacobian and grasp stiffness matrices. The results show that the orientation of the ellipsoids can be related to salient task requirements.},

abstract = {Single cycles of hopping and climbing were investigated in Japanese Pygmy Woodpeckers Picoides kizuki using motion analyses on video. Body movements on substrate angled from 0-90 degrees were compared for every 10 degrees. The body was inclined forward during stance phase for both small and large substrate angles, and the inclination amplitude increased when the substrate angle increased. The tail was bent ventrally almost simultaneously to this body inclination, and its amplitude was apparently high at large substrate angles. Most of the gait parameters changed when the stride length increased. The minimum body-tail angle and most of the parameters representing body movements during stance phase changed when the substrate angle increased, probably because gravity pulled the birds further backward when they were moving on a steeper slope. These parameters showed a clear difference between the data on substrate steeper than 40 degrees and lower than 30 degrees. The abrupt changes in these parameters most likely mean that the motor pattern changed from hopping to climbing between these angles.},

abstract = {Many-legged animals, such as crabs and cockroaches, utilize whole-body mechanics similar to that observed for running bipeds and trotting quadrupedal mammals. Despite the diversity in morphology, two legs in a quadrupedal mammal, three legs in an insect and four legs in a crab can function in the same way as one leg of a biped during ground contact. To explain how diverse leg designs can result in common whole-body dynamics, we used a miniature force platform to measure the ground reaction forces produced by individual legs of the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis. Hexapedal runners were not like quadrupeds with an additional set of legs. In trotting quadrupedal mammals each leg develops a similar ground reaction force pattern that sums to produce the whole-body pattern. At a constant average velocity, each leg pair of the cockroach was characterized by a unique ground reaction force pattern. The first leg decelerated the center of mass in the horizontal direction, whereas the third leg was used to accelerate the body. The second leg did both, much like legs in bipedal runners and quadrupedal trotters. Vertical force peaks for each leg were equal in magnitude. In general, peak ground reaction force vectors minimized joint moments and muscle forces by being oriented towards the coxal joints, which articulate with the body. Locomotion with a sprawled posture does not necessarily result in large moments around joints. Calculations on B. discoidalis showed that deviations from the minimum moments may be explained by considering the minimization of the summed muscle forces in more than one leg. Production of horizontal forces that account for most of the mechanical energy generated during locomotion can actually reduce total muscle force by directing the ground reaction forces through the leg joints. Whole-body dynamics common to two-, four-, six- and eight-legged runners is produced in six-legged runners by three pairs of legs that differ in orientation with respect to the body, generate unique ground reaction force patterns, but combine to function in the same way as one leg of a biped.},

abstract = {Locomotion results from complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamically coupled interactions between an organism and its environment. Fortunately, simple models we call templates have been and can be made to resolve the redundancy of multiple legs, joints and muscles by seeking synergies and symmetries. A template is the simplest model (least number of variables and parameters) that exhibits a targeted behavior. For example, diverse species that differ in skeletal type, leg number and posture run in a stable manner like sagittal- and horizontal-plane spring-mass systems. Templates suggest control strategies that can be tested against empirical data. Templates must be grounded in more detailed morphological and physiological models to ask specific questions about multiple legs, the joint torques that actuate them, the recruitment of muscles that produce those torques and the neural networks that activate the ensemble. We term these more elaborate models anchors. They introduce representations of specific biological details whose mechanism of coordination is of interest. Since mechanisms require controls, anchors incorporate specific hypotheses concerning the manner in which unnecessary motion or energy from legs, joints and muscles is removed, leaving behind the behavior of the body in the low-degree-of-freedom template. Locating the origin of control is a challenge because neural and mechanical systems are dynamically coupled and both play a role. The control of slow, variable-frequency locomotion appears to be dominated by the nervous system, whereas during rapid, rhythmic locomotion, the control may reside more within the mechanical system. Anchored templates of many-legged, sprawled-postured animals suggest that passive, dynamic self-stabilization from a feedforward, tuned mechanical system can reject rapid perturbations and simplify control. Future progress would benefit from the creation of a field embracing comparative neuromechanics.},

abstract = {Six-legged pedestrians, cockroaches, use a running gait during locomotion. The gait was defined by measuring ground reaction forces and mechanical energy fluctuations of the center of mass in Blaberus discoidalis (Serville) as they travelled over a miniature force platform. These six-legged animals produce horizontal and vertical ground-reaction patterns of force similar to those found in two-, four- and eight-legged runners. Lateral forces were less than half the vertical force fluctuations. At speeds between 0.08 and 0.66 ms-1, horizontal kinetic and gravitational potential energy changes were in phase. This pattern of energy fluctuation characterizes the bouncing gaits used by other animals that run. Blaberus discoidalis attained a maximum sustainable stride frequency of 13 Hz at 0.35 ms-1, the same speed and frequency predicted for a mammal of the same mass. Despite differences in body form, the mass-specific energy used to move the center of mass a given distance (0.9 J kg-1m-1) was the same for cockroaches, ghost crabs, mammals, and birds. Similarities in force production, stride frequency and mechanical energy production during locomotion suggest that there may be common design constraints in terrestrial locomotion which scale with body mass and are relatively independent of body form, leg number and skeletal type.},

From 0.44-1.0 ms-1, P. americana used an alternating tripod stepping pattern. Fluctuations in gravitational potential energy and horizontal kinetic energy of the center of mass were nearly in phase, characteristic of a running or bouncing gait. Aerial phases were observed as vertical ground reaction force approached zero at speeds above 1 ms-1. At the highest speeds (1.0-1.5 ms-1 or 50 body lengths per second), P. americana switched to quadrupedal and bipedal running. Stride frequency approached the wing beat frequencies used during flight (27 Hz). High speeds were attained by increasing stride length, whereas stride frequency showed little increase with speed. The mechanical power used to accelerate the center of mass increased curvilinearly with speed. The mass-specific mechanical energy used to move the center of mass a given distance was similar to that measured for animals five orders of magnitude larger in mass, but was only one-hundredth of the metabolic cost.},

abstract = {Integrating studies of mechanics, neural control and isolated muscle function are possible using arthropod legs. To evaluate leg performance, we measured the ground reaction forces generated by individual legs of the six-legged cockroach Blaberus discoidalis (3.1 g), during an emergency behavior, righting or over-turning. We used a photoelastic method to measure the forces generated by individual legs simultaneously. A gelatin track placed between crossed polarizing filters was illuminated from below, and a high-speed video camera recorded the stress-induced optical signals from above. The size and skew of the optical patterns were found to be related to the magnitude and direction of the force. We discovered that the ground reaction forces generated during the righting behavior of the death-head cockroach were eight times greater than those observed during high-speed running, supporting the possibility that relative leg forces (leg force per unit body weight) during running and maximal leg activity differ more in small arthropods than in larger vertebrates. Non-geometric scaling of relative leg force (i.e. scaling to less than body mass-0.33), along with the reduced force-generating ability of a single leg in animals with many legs, may help to explain why the maximum relative leg force production by six-legged cockroaches, as well as by some other small insects, can be similar to the relative single leg forces produced by two- and four-legged vertebrates that are almost 1000 times more massive. Leg number and body mass alone, however, appear to be insufficient to explain the variation observed in relative leg force production at a given body mass, because enormous diversity in musculo-skeletal parameters exists. The maximal relative leg force of the cockroach B. discoidalis during righting was at the low end of a 100-fold variation observed for smaller insects wedging (pushing through a small crevice) and pulling loads. Thus, this cockroach can be characterized as a moderately strong insect with the capacity for relatively high speed. Results from the present study question the predictive strength of the simple geometric scaling arguments involving a strength:weight ratio as they are applied to small arthropods and encourage further consideration of the importance of leg number, muscle force production and mechanical advantage in the derivation of general principles of leg performance.},

abstract = {Creating an autonomous flying vehicle the size of a honeybee presents a number of technical challenges because of its small scale. As vehicle wingspan diminishes, angular acceleration rates increase, necessitating sensing and control sys- tems with high bandwidth. Hovering demonstra- tions have so far required feedback from high- speedmotion capture cameras to estimate the an- gular velocity, attitude, and position of the ve- hicle to provide the continuous corrective feed- back necessary to avoid tumbling. To achieve autonomous flight, it will be necessary to incor- porate a suite of sensors carried onboard. Here we present a step in this direction by integrating a MEMS gyroscope onto an 80 mg flapping-wing micro air vehicle to provide attitude feedback in flight. This enables 2–5 s hovering flights in which the motion capture system provides only position feedback. Our vehicle, and likely oth- ers in the future of similar scale, is propelled by flapping wings that generate vibration. Our results indicate that the resulting accelerations, measured as high as 5 g by the sensor's ac- celerometer, significantly distort readings from the the accelerometer but not the gyroscope.},

abstract = {Dexterous use of the hand represents a sophisticated sensorimotor function. In behaviors such as playing the piano, it can involve strong temporal and spatial constraints. The purpose of this study was to determine fundamental patterns of covariation of motion across joints and digits of the human hand. Joint motion was recorded while 5 expert pianists played 30 excerpts from musical pieces, which featured ∼50 different tone sequences and fingering. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis using an expectation-maximization algorithm revealed that joint velocities could be categorized into several patterns, which help to simplify the description of the movements of the multiple degrees of freedom of the hand. For the thumb keystroke, two distinct patterns of joint movement covariation emerged and they depended on the spatiotemporal patterns of the task. For example, the thumb-under maneuver was clearly separated into two clusters based on the direction of hand translation along the keyboard. While the pattern of the thumb joint velocities differed between these clusters, the motions at the metacarpo-phalangeal and proximal-phalangeal joints of the four fingers were more consistent. For a keystroke executed with one of the fingers, there were three distinct patterns of joint rotations, across which motion at the striking finger was fairly consistent, but motion of the other fingers was more variable. Furthermore, the amount of movement spillover of the striking finger to the adjacent fingers was small irrespective of the finger used for the keystroke. These findings describe an unparalleled amount of independent motion of the fingers.},

Using a composite laminate batch fabrication process with biocompatible constituent materials, we have fabricated a fully-integrated, 10×10 mm three-axis force sensor with up to 5 V/N sensitivity and RMS noise on the order of ∼1.6 mN, operational over a range of -500 to 500 mN in the x- and y-axes, and -2.5 to 2.5 N in the z-axis. Custom foil-based strain sensors were fabricated in parallel with the mechanical structure, obviating the need for post-manufacturing alignment and assembly. The sensor and its custom-fabricated signal conditioning circuitry fit within a 1×1×2 cm volume to realize a fully-integrated force transduction platform with potential haptics and control applications in minimally-invasive surgical tools. The form factor, biocompatibility, and cost of the sensor and signal conditioning makes this method ideal for rapid-prototyping low-cost, mm-scale distal force sensors. Sensor performance is validated in a simulated tissue palpation task using a robotic master-slave platform.},

abstract = {The small scale of minimally-invasive surgery (MIS) presents significant challenges to developing robust, smart, and dexterous tools for manipulating millimeter and sub-millimeter anatomical structures (vessels, nerves) and surgical equipment (sutures, staples). Robotic MIS systems offer the potential to transform this medical field by enabling precise repair of these miniature tissue structures through the use of teleoperation and haptic feedback. However, this effort is currently limited by the inability to make robust and accurate MIS end effectors with integrated force and contact sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the novel Pop-Up Book MEMS manufacturing method to fabricate the mechanical and sensing elements of an instrumented MIS grasper. A custom thin-foil strain gage was manufactured in parallel with the mechanical components of the grasper to realize a fully-integrated electromechanical system in a single manufacturing step, removing the need for manual assembly, bonding and alignment. In preliminary experiments, the integrated grasper is capable of resolving forces as low as 30 mN, with a sensitivity of approximately 408 mV/N. This level of performance will enable robotic surgical systems that can handle delicate tissue structures and perform dexterous procedures through the use of haptic feedback guidance. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper details the design, analysis, fabrication, and validation of a deployable, atraumatic grasper intended for retraction and manipulation tasks in manual and robotic minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures. Fabricated using a combination of shape deposition manufacturing (SDM) and 3D printing, the device (which acts as a deployable end-effector for robotic platforms) has the potential to reduce the risk of intraoperative hemorrhage by providing a soft, compliant interface between delicate tissue structures and the metal laparoscopic forceps and graspers that are currently used to manipulate and retract these structures on an ad hoc basis. This paper introduces a general analytical framework for designing SDM fingers where the desire is to predict the shape and the transmission ratio, and this framework was used to design a multijointed grasper that relies on geometric trapping to manipulate tissue, rather than friction or pinching, to provide a safe, stable, adaptive, and conformable means for manipulation. Passive structural compliance, coupled with active grip force monitoring enabled by embedded pressure sensors, helps to reduce the cognitive load on the surgeon. Initial manipulation tasks in a simulated environment have demonstrated that the device can be deployed though a 15 mm trocar and develop a stable grasp using Intuitive Surgical's daVinci robotic platform to deftly manipulate a tissue analog.},

abstract = {Recent advances in medical robotics have initiated a transition from rigid serial manipulators to flexible or continuum robots capable of navigating to confined anatomy within the body. A desire for further procedure minimization is a key accelerator for the development of these flexible systems where the end goal is to provide access to the previously inaccessible anatomical workspaces and enable new minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures. While sophisticated navigation and control capabilities have been demonstrated for such systems, existing manufacturing approaches have limited the capabilities of millimeter-scale end-effectors for these flexible systems to date and, to achieve next generation highly functional end-effectors for surgical robots, advanced manufacturing approaches are required. We address this challenge by utilizing a disruptive 2D layerby-layer precision fabrication process (inspired by printed circuit board manufacturing) that can create functional 3D mechanisms by folding 2D layers of materials which may be structural, flexible, adhesive, or conductive. Such an approach enables actuation, sensing, circuitry to be directly integrated with the articulating features by selecting the appropriate materials during the layer-by-layer manufacturing process. To demonstrate the efficacy of this technology, we use it to fabricate three modular robotic components at the millimeter-scale: (1) sensors, (2) mechanisms, (3) actuators. These modules could potentially be implemented into transendoscopic systems, enabling bilateral grasping, retraction and cutting, could potentially mitigate challenging MIS interventions performed via endoscopy or flexible means. This research lays the ground work for new mechanism, sensor and actuation technologies that can be readily integrated via new millimeter-scale layer-by-layer manufacturing approaches.},

Existing solutions for deep sea robotic manipulation have historically been driven by the oil industry, resulting in destructive interactions with undersea life. Soft material robotics relies on compliant materials that are inherently impedance matched to natural environments and to soft or fragile organisms. We demonstrate design principles for soft robot end effectors, bench-top characterization of their grasping performance, and conclude by describing in situ testing at mesophotic depths. The result is the first use of soft robotics in the deep sea for the nondestructive sampling of benthic fauna.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel compliant robotic gripper with three variable stiffness fingers. While the shape morphing of the grippers is cable-driven, the stiffness variation is enabled by layer jamming. The inherent flexibility makes compliant grippers suitable for tasks such as grasping soft and irregular objects. However, their relatively low load capacity due to low structural stiffness limits their applications. Variable stiffness robotic grippers have the potential to address this challenge as their stiffness can be tuned on demand based on the needs of tasks. Layer jamming is an emerging method for variable stiffness due to its advantages of light weight, simple and quick actuation. In our design, the compliant backbone of the fingers is made of 3d printed PLA material. Four thin film materials are attached to each side of the skeleton. The working process of the robotic gripper follows two basic steps. First, the compliant skeleton is bent to a desired shape by actuating a tension cable via a servo motor. Second, upon application of a negative pressure by a vacuum pump, the finger is stiffened up owing to the increasing of the friction between contact surfaces of layers preventing their relative movement. Since the structural stiffness of the fingers is increased, their load capacity will be increased proportionally. When the air pressure is sufficiently large, the morphed shape can even be locked (no slipping). Test for stiffness of individual finger and load capacity of the robotic gripper are conducted to validate capability of the design. The results showed a 69-fold increase in stiffness of individual finger and a 30-fold increase in gripper's load capacity.},

abstract = {Plausible poses were identified for the hind limb of Tyrannosaurus rex and three other non-avian theropod dinosaurs at mid-stance of locomotion using constraint-based exclusion. This new method, validated by analysis of two species of birds, involves applying demonstrably realistic geometric and kinetic (force-based) constraints from extant animals to exclude, rather than include, potential poses. Starting with a "configuration space" of millions of candidate poses, we used a step-wise series of criteria to constrict the volume to a small subset of solutions, which can serve as starting points for reconstructing complete stride cycles. It was found that the maximum relative mid-stance limb force, as well as the relative number of configurations at lower forces, decreased with increasing body size. Constraint-based exclusion restricted Tyrannosaurus to a narrow region of neither very columnar nor very flexed poses that may have allowed relatively slow running, but no reasonable combinations of input parameters and pose produce forces large enough for high speeds. This analysis shows that skeletal information alone has limited value for discerning mid-stance poses. Despite additional assumptions, unpreserved parameters such as masses, forces, and moments are required to study a fossil as a functioning animal, rather than as a moving set of bones. Constraint-based exclusion is a transparent, reproducible framework for evaluating functional hypotheses in dinosaurs and other taxa.},

abstract = {Symbolic equations of motion (EOMs) for multibody systems are desirable for simulation, stability analyses, control system design, and parameter studies. Despite this, the majority of engineering software designed to analyze multibody systems are numeric in nature (or present a purely numeric user interface). To our knowledge, none of the existing software packages are 1) fully symbolic, 2) open source, and 3) implemented in a popular, general, purpose high level programming language. In response, we extended SymPy (an existing computer algebra system implemented in Python) with functionality for derivation of symbolic EOMs for constrained multibody systems with many degrees of freedom. We present the design and implementation of the software and cover the basic usage and workflow for solving and analyzing problems. The intended audience is the academic research community, graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and those in industry analyzing multibody systems. We demonstrate the software by deriving the EOMs of a N-link pendulum, show its capabilities for LATEX output, and how it integrates with other Python scientific libraries - allowing for numerical simulation, publication quality plotting, animation, and online notebooks designed for sharing results. This software fills a unique role in dynamics and is attractive to academics and industry because of its BSD open source license which permits open source or commercial use of the code.

abstract = {The basic mechanics of human locomotion are associated with vaulting over stiff legs in walking and rebounding on compliant legs in running. However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring–mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.},

abstract = {Many arthropods are known to achieve dynamic stability during rapid locomotion on rough terrains despite the absence of an elaborate nervous system. While muscle viscoelasticity and its inherent friction have been thought to cause this passive absorption of energy, the role of embedded microstructures in muscles and muscle joints has not yet been investigated. Inspired by the soft and flexible hinge joints present in many of these animals, we have carried out displacement-controlled bending of thin elastic slabs embedded with fluid-filled microchannels. During loading, the slab bends uniformly to a critical curvature, beyond which the skin covering the channel buckles with a catastrophic decrease in load. In the reverse cycle, the buckled skin straightens out but at a significantly lower load. In such a loading-unloading cycle, this localized buckling phenomenon results in a dynamic change in the geometry of the joint, which leads to a significant hysteresis in elastic energy. The hysteresis varies nonlinearly with channel diameters and thicknesses of the slab, which is captured by a simple scaling analysis of the phenomenon.},

@article{Giandolini2016,
abstract = {Scientific experiments on running mainly consider level running. However, the magnitude and etiology of fatigue depend on the exercise under consideration, particularly the predominant type of contraction, which differs between level, uphill, and downhill running. The purpose of this review is to comprehensively summarize the neurophysiological and biomechanical changes due to fatigue in graded running. When comparing prolonged hilly running (i.e., a combination of uphill and downhill running) to level running, it is found that (1) the general shape of the neuromuscular fatigue-exercise duration curve as well as the etiology of fatigue in knee extensor and plantar flexor muscles are similar and (2) the biomechanical consequences are also relatively comparable, suggesting that duration rather than elevation changes affects neuromuscular function and running patterns. However, 'pure' uphill or downhill running has several fatigue-related intrinsic features compared with the level running. Downhill running induces severe lower limb tissue damage, indirectly evidenced by massive increases in plasma creatine kinase/myoglobin concentration or inflammatory markers. In addition, low-frequency fatigue (i.e., excitation-contraction coupling failure) is systematically observed after downhill running, although it has also been found in high-intensity uphill running for different reasons. Indeed, low-frequency fatigue in downhill running is attributed to mechanical stress at the interface sarcoplasmic reticulum/T-tubule, while the inorganic phosphate accumulation probably plays a central role in intense uphill running. Other fatigue-related specificities of graded running such as strategies to minimize the deleterious effects of downhill running on muscle function, the difference of energy cost versus heat storage or muscle activity changes in downhill, level, and uphill running are also discussed.},

In the present paper a method for the production of gradient structures with extrusion-type 3D Printing is discussed. The method involves three main steps: defining the geometry and material distribution of each layer in the form of a grayscale image, generating a set of points distributed according to the gray tone of the image and constructing a continuous path through the points for guiding material deposition by the 3D printer. In order to better present and test the method, two test cases of gradient structures are examined.},

abstract = {The design of a general-purpose multibody simulator that runs in real-time and features haptic display is presented. The repertoire of this simulator includes systems subject to holonomic constraints, nonholonomic constraints, and notably, systems subject to changing constraints. In contrast to the use of generic equations of motion, Kane's method is used by a computerized symbolic manipulator to produce custom-built, compact, and computationally efficient ordinary differential equations for each virtual system to be simulated. A method is presented whereby new equations, reflecting the presence of a transient constraint, may be formulated on-line by a recombination of terms comprising the nominal equations. This paper also serves as a tutorial introduction to Kane's method and includes a detailed derivation of Kane's equations with a geometric interpretation. An illustrative example featuring changing constraint conditions is developed in the body of the paper while two more examples, chosen to highlight certain features within Kane's method, are presented at the conclusion. 1},

However, when an object is not fully in view it can be difficult to form an accurate estimate of the object's shape and pose, particularly when the object deforms. In this paper we describe a generative model of object geometry based on Mardia and Dryden's "Probabilistic Procrustean Shape", which captures both non-rigid deformations and object variability in a class. We extend their shape model to the setting where point correspondences are unknown using Scott and Nowak's COPAP framework. We use this model to recognize objects in a cluttered image and to infer their complete two-dimensional boundaries with a novel algorithm called OSIRIS. We show examples of learned models from image data and demonstrate how the models can be used by a manipulation planner to grasp objects  in cluttered visual scenes.},

abstract = {This paper presents a critical review on the calculation of the mobility, the main structural and kinematic parameter of a mechanism. We focus on a brief presentation and a critical analysis of various methods presented in the literature in the last 150 years, to clearly situate the different contributions to this very important subject of the theory of mechanisms. Thirty five approaches/formulas for mobility calculation are presented and their genesis, similarities and limitations are investigated. The various methods proposed in the literature for mobility calculation are grouped in two categories: approaches based on setting up the kinematic constraint equations and their rank calculation and formulas for a quick calculation of mobility without need to develop the constraint equations. We emphasize on the limits of formulas for quick calculation of mobility by applying them to a parallel robot with elementary legs and ascertaining that the results are erroneous. In fact, the formulas for quick calculation of mobility known in the literature do not fit for many classical or modern mechanisms. We explain why these formulas do not work for certain mechanisms and we propose a new formula for quick mobility calculation of parallel mechanisms with elementary legs. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Six different gaits are run on HAMR to validate the experimental setup and establish baseline performance. Furthermore, HAMR is compared with the cockroach, Blaberus Discoidalis, and with other legged robots.

abstract = {Rapid, vertically climbing cockroaches produced climbing dynamics similar to geckos, despite differences in attachment mechanism, ;foot or toe' morphology and leg number. Given the common pattern in such diverse species, we propose the first template for the dynamics of rapid, legged climbing analogous to the spring-loaded, inverted pendulum used to characterize level running in a diversity of pedestrians. We measured single leg wall reaction forces and center of mass dynamics in death-head cockroaches Blaberus discoidalis, as they ascended a three-axis force plate oriented vertically and coated with glass beads to aid attachment. Cockroaches used an alternating tripod gait during climbs at 19.5+/-4.2 cm s(-1), approximately 5 body lengths s(-1). Single-leg force patterns differed significantly from level running. During vertical climbing, all legs generated forces to pull the animal up the plate. Front and middle legs pulled laterally toward the midline. Front legs pulled the head toward the wall, while hind legs pushed the abdomen away. These single-leg force patterns summed to generate dynamics of the whole animal in the frontal plane such that the center of mass cyclically accelerated up the wall in synchrony with cyclical side-to-side motion that resulted from alternating net lateral pulling forces. The general force patterns used by cockroaches and geckos have provided biological inspiration for the design of a climbing robot named RiSE (Robots in Scansorial Environments).},

abstract = {As animals develop, tissue bending contributes to shape the organs into complex three-dimensional structures. However, the architecture and packing of curved epithelia remains largely unknown. Here we show by means of mathematical modelling that cells in bent epithelia can undergo intercalations along the apico-basal axis. This phenomenon forces cells to have different neighbours in their basal and apical surfaces. As a consequence, epithelial cells adopt a novel shape that we term “scutoid”. The detailed analysis of diverse tissues confirms that generation of apico-basal intercalations between cells is a common feature during morphogenesis. Using biophysical arguments, we propose that scutoids make possible the minimization of the tissue energy and stabilize three-dimensional packing. Hence, we conclude that scutoids are one of nature's solutions to achieve epithelial bending. Our findings pave the way to understand the three-dimensional organization of epithelial organs.},

abstract = {We report on the development of a knowledge representation model, which is based on the SHARED object model reported in Shared Workspaces for Computer-Aided Collaborative Engineering (Wong, A. and Sriram, D., Technical Report, IESL 93-06, Intelligent Engineering Systems Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, MIT, March, 1993) and Research in Engineering Design (Wong, A. and Sriram, D., SHARED: An Information Model for Cooperative Product Development, 1993, Fall, 21-39). Our current model is implemented as a layered scheme, that incorporates both an evolving artifact and its associated design process. To represent artifacts as they evolve, we define objects recursively without a pre-defined granularity on this recursive decomposition. This eliminates the need for translations between levels of abstraction in the design process. The SHARED model extends traditional OOP in three ways: (1) by allowing explicit relationship classes with inheritance hierarchies; (2) by permitting constraints to be associated with objects and relationships; and (3) by comparing 'similar' objects at three different levels (form, function and behavior). Five primitive objects define the design process: goal, plan, specification, decision and context. Goal objects achieve function, introduce constraints, introduce new artifacts or modify existing ones, and create subgoals. Plan objects order goals and link a product hierarchy to a process hierarchy. Specification objects define user inputs as constraints. Decision objects relate goals to user decisions and context objects describe the design context. Operators that are applied to design objects collectively form a representation of the design process for a given context. The representation is robust enough to effectively model four design paradigms [described in Journal of CAD (Gorti, S. and Sriram, R. D., Symbol to Form Mapping: a Framework for Conceptual Design, 1996, 28(11), 853-870)]: top-down decomposition, stepwise refinement, bottom-up composition and constraint propagation. To demonstrate this, we represent the designs of two TV remote controllers in the SHARED architecture. The example reveals that certain aspects of artifact knowledge are essentially contextindependent and that this representation can be a foundation for robust knowledge-based systems in design.

abstract = {Obtaining an accurate mechanical model of a soft deformable robot compatible with the computation time imposed by robotic applications is often considered an unattainable goal. This paper should invert this idea. The proposed methodology offers the possibility to dramatically reduce the size and the online computation time of a finite element model (FEM) of a soft robot. After a set of expensive offline simulations based on the whole model, we apply snapshot-proper orthogonal decomposition to sharply reduce the number of state variables of the soft-robot model. To keep the computational efficiency, hyperreduction is used to perform the integration on a reduced domain. The method allows to tune the error during the two main steps of complexity reduction. The method handles external loads (contact, friction, gravity, etc.) with precision as long as they are tested during the offline simulations. The method is validated on two very different examples of FEMs of soft robots and on one real soft robot. It enables acceleration factors of more than 100, while saving accuracy, in particular compared to coarsely meshed FEMs and provides a generic way to control soft robots.},

abstract = {For aerial robots, maintaining a high vantage point for an extended time is crucial in many applications. However, available on-board power and mechanical fatigue constrain their flight time, especially for smaller, battery-powered aircraft. Perching on elevated structures is a biologically inspired approach to overcome these limitations. Previous perching robots have required specific material properties for the landing sites, such as surface asperities for spines, or ferromagnetism. We describe a switchable electroadhesive that enables controlled perching and detachment on nearly any material while requiring approximately three orders of magnitude less power than required to sustain flight. These electroadhesives are designed, characterized, and used to demonstrate a flying robotic insect able to robustly perch on a wide range of materials, including glass, wood, and a natural leaf.},

abstract = {Locomotion emerges from effective interactions of an individual with its environment. Principles of biological terrestrial locomotion have been discovered on unconfined vertical and horizontal substrates. However, a diversity of organisms construct, inhabit, and move within confined spaces. Such animals are faced with locomotor challenges including limited limb range of motion, crowding, and visual sensory deprivation. Little is known about how these organisms accomplish their locomotor tasks, and such environments challenge human-made devices. To gain insight into how animals move within confined spaces, we study the locomotion of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, which constructs subterranean tunnel networks (nests). Laboratory experiments reveal that ants construct tunnels with diameter, D, comparable to body length, L = 3.5 ± 0.5 mm. Ants can move rapidly (> 9 bodylengths per s) within these environments; their tunnels allow for effective limb, body, and antennae interaction with walls, which facilitate rapid slip-recovery during ascending and descending climbs. To examine the limits of slip-recovery in artificial tunnels, we perform perturbations consisting of rapid downward accelerations of the tunnels, which induce falls. Below a critical tunnel diameter, Ds = 1.31 ± 0.02 L, falls are always arrested through rapid interaction of appendages and antennae with tunnel walls to jam the falls. Ds is comparable to the size of incipient nest tunnels (D = 1.06 ± 0.23 L), supporting our hypothesis that fire ants construct environments that simplify their control task when moving through the nest, likely without need for rapid nervous system intervention.},

abstract = {The design of flapping wing robots and the study of flapping wing flyers requires a detailed knowledge of how wings interact with the surrounding fluid. However, the un- steady nature of fluid-structure interactions during flapping wing flight render analytical design of wing shapes and motion kinematics difficult.We propose that flapping wing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) design will benefit from a complimentary, data- driven approach in which wing shape, material properties, and stroke-kinematics may be varied rapidly. Here, we present a high-throughput experimental apparatus for fabrication and optimization of MAV wings for flapping flight. This apparatus incorporates the collection and analysis of multiple sensor modalities including force, electrical power, resultant fluid flow, and wing kinematics into the experiment control loop. This “analysis-in-the-loop” methodology enables multivariate optimization routines for flapping flight of unmanned aerial vehicles. We demonstrate the validity of this approach through optimization experiments on wing kinematics, fluid flow, lift and power consumption. I.},

abstract = {Geckos owe their remarkable stickiness to millions of dry, hard setae on their toes. In this study, we discovered that gecko setae stick more strongly the faster they slide, and do not wear out after 30,000 cycles. This is surprising because friction between dry, hard, macroscopic materials typically decreases at the onset of sliding, and as velocity increases, friction continues to decrease because of a reduction in the number of interfacial contacts, due in part to wear. Gecko setae did not exhibit the decrease in adhesion or friction characteristic of a transition from static to kinetic contact mechanics. Instead, friction and adhesion forces increased at the onset of sliding and continued to increase with shear speed from 500 nm s(-1) to 158 mm s(-1). To explain how apparently fluid-like, wear-free dynamic friction and adhesion occur macroscopically in a dry, hard solid, we proposed a model based on a population of nanoscopic stick-slip events. In the model, contact elements are either in static contact or in the process of slipping to a new static contact. If stick-slip events are uncorrelated, the model further predicted that contact forces should increase to a critical velocity (V*) and then decrease at velocities greater than V*. We hypothesized that, like natural gecko setae, but unlike any conventional adhesive, gecko-like synthetic adhesives (GSAs) could adhere while sliding. To test the generality of our results and the validity of our model, we fabricated a GSA using a hard silicone polymer. While sliding, the GSA exhibited steady-state adhesion and velocity dependence similar to that of gecko setae. Observations at the interface indicated that macroscopically smooth sliding of the GSA emerged from randomly occurring stick-slip events in the population of flexible fibrils, confirming our model predictions.},

abstract = {Unlike other amphibians, frogs often use their forelimbs to capture and transport prey. In the present study, high-speed videography was used to observe forelimb use during feeding in a diverse group of anurans in order to determine the evolution of forelimb movement patterns among anuran taxa. Data were gathered from 488 individuals representing 104 species, 55 genera, and 16 families. Five distinct behavior patterns were identified: scooping entails using the back of the hand to push prey into the mouth; wiping involves the use of the palm of the hand to push prey, protruding laterally from the mouth, toward the midline; during prey stretching, one end of the prey is held in a stationary position by the hands while the other end is pulled upward by the jaws; in grasping, the palms face the midline or the substrate as the fingers are wrapped around the prey; grasping with wrist rotation is similar to grasping, but the wrists rotate inward as the hands grasp the prey so that the palms face the mouth. The distribution of these behavior patterns was mapped onto the most recent phylogenetic hypothesis for anurans. Maximum parsimony analyses suggest that scooping and wiping are primitive and have been retained by many frog lineages. Wiping was not observed in the pipids, which are the only anurans that lack tongues and use hydraulic transport. Prey stretching appears to have evolved several times in unrelated taxa. Grasping and grasping with wrist rotation appear to have evolved only in arboreal groups, suggesting that the ability to climb is a preadaptation for the ability to grasp prey. Several species were observed using grasping motions in place of the tongue to capture prey.},

abstract = {Physical human–robot interaction implies the intersection of human and robot workspaces and intrinsically favors collision. The robustness of the most exposed parts, such as the hands, is crucial for effective and complete task execution of a robot. Considering the scales, we think that the robustness can only be achieved by the use of energy storage mechanisms, e.g. in elastic elements. The use of variable stiffness drives provides a low-pass filtering of impacts and allows stiffness adjustments depending on the task. However, using these drive principles does not guarantee the safety of the human due to the dramatically increased dynamics of such system. The design methodology of an antagonistically tendon-driven hand is explained. The resulting hand, very close to its human archetype in terms of size, weight, and, in particular, grasping performance, robustness, and dynamics, is presented. The hyper-actuated hand is a research platform that will also be used to investigate the importance of mechanical couplings and, in future projects, be the basis of a simplified hand that would still perform daily manipulation tasks.},

abstract = {Pigeons made 10 flights to a novel perch. Kinematic measurements of these flights were obtained from video recordings, and the forces exerted on the perch on each landing were measured. There was wide variation (20-fold range) in the kinetic energy of the pigeons just before landing, arising almost entirely from variation in horizontal velocity. The maximum force exerted on the perch varied in magnitude from approximately twice to eight times the pigeons' body weight, and in direction from 40 to 90 below the horizontal. In landings with high final kinetic energy, the maximum force exerted on the perch was larger and was applied at a shallower angle than in those with low final kinetic energy. Landing flights with high final kinetic energy showed straighter trajectories and a larger peak deceleration during the last 300 ms of approach flight than those with low final kinetic energy, which had downward-curving trajectories and a more prolonged and steady pattern of deceleration. Mean final kinetic energy was lower in the first two landings made on the perch than in subsequent landings, indicating that pigeons are more likely to adopt a slow, downward-curving approach to a novel perch and a fast, straight approach to a familiar one.},

abstract = {— We describe a new series pneumatic artificial muscle (sPAM) and its application as an actuator for a soft continuum robot. The robot consists of three sPAMs arranged radially around a tubular pneumatic backbone. Analogous to tendons, the sPAMs exert a tension force on the robot's pneu-matic backbone, causing bending that is approximately constant curvature. Unlike a traditional tendon driven continuum robot, the robot is entirely soft and contains no hard components, making it safer for human interaction. Models of both the sPAM and soft continuum robot kinematics are presented and experimentally verified. We found a mean position accuracy of 5.5 cm for predicting the end-effector position of a 42 cm long robot with the kinematic model. Finally, closed-loop control is demonstrated using an eye-in-hand visual servo control law which provides a simple interface for operation by a human. The soft continuum robot with closed-loop control was found to have a step-response rise time and settling time of less than two seconds.},

abstract = {We studied nine adult horses spanning an eightfold range in body mass (M(b)) (90-720 kg) and a twofold range in leg length (L) (0.7-1.4 m). We measured the horses' walk-trot transition speeds using step-wise speed increments as they locomoted on a motorized treadmill. We then measured their rates of oxygen consumption over a wide range of walking and trotting speeds. We interpreted the transition speed results using a simple inverted-pendulum model of walking in which gravity provides the centripetal force necessary to keep the leg in contact with the ground. By studying a large size range of horses, we were naturally able to vary the absolute walking speed that would produce the same ratio of centripetal to gravitational forces. This ratio, (M(b)v2/L)/(M(b)g), reduces to the dimensionless Froude number (v2/gL), where v is forward speed, L is leg length and g is gravitational acceleration. We found that the absolute walk-trot transition speed increased with size from 1.6 to 2.3 m s(-1), but it occurred at nearly the same Froude number (0.35). In addition, horses spontaneously switched between gaits in a narrow range of speeds that corresponded to the metabolically optimal transition speed. These results support the hypotheses that the walk-trot transition is triggered by inverted-pendulum dynamics and occurs at the speed that maximizes metabolic economy.},

In order to mimic the capabilities of an able-bodied, a powered prosthetic ankle for walking and running was designed. A powered system has the potential to reduce the limitations in range of motion and positive work output of passive walking and running feet. Methods: To perform the experiments a controller capable of transitions between standing, walking, and running with speed adaptations was developed. In the first case study the system was mounted on an ankle bypass in parallel with the foot of a non-amputee subject. By this method the functionality of hardware and controller was proven. Results: The Walk-Run ankle was capable of mimicking desired torque and angle trajectories in walking and running up to 2.6 m/s. At 4 m/s running, ankle angle could be matched while ankle torque could not. Limited ankle output power resulting from a suboptimal spring stiffness value was identified as a main reason. Conclusions: Further studies have to show to what extent the findings can be transferred to amputees.},

A second purpose is to inspire the development of new feedback control algorithms for running on level surfaces and walking on rough terrain.

abstract = {Birds still share many traits with their dinosaur ancestors, making them the best living group to reconstruct certain aspects of non-avian theropod biology. Bipedal, digitigrade locomotion and parasagittal hindlimb movement are some of those inherited traits. Living birds, however, maintain an unusually crouched hindlimb posture and locomotion powered by knee flexion, in contrast to the inferred primitive condition of non-avian theropods: more upright posture and limb movement powered by femur retraction. Such functional differences, which are associated with a gradual, anterior shift of the centre of mass in theropods along the bird line, make the use of extant birds to study non-avian theropod locomotion problematic. Here we show that, by experimentally manipulating the location of the centre of mass in living birds, it is possible to recreate limb posture and kinematics inferred for extinct bipedal dinosaurs. Chickens raised wearing artificial tails, and consequently with more posteriorly located centre of mass, showed a more vertical orientation of the femur during standing and increased femoral displacement during locomotion. Our results support the hypothesis that gradual changes in the location of the centre of mass resulted in more crouched hindlimb postures and a shift from hip-driven to knee-driven limb movements through theropod evolution. This study suggests that, through careful experimental manipulations during the growth phase of ontogeny, extant birds can potentially be used to gain important insights into previously unexplored aspects of bipedal non-avian theropod locomotion.

abstract = {A major benefit of educational robotics is its hands-on nature. This makes the learning process more com- pelling for most students, and underscores the con- nection between science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) theory and physical reality. Educational haptics takes this premise a step further: haptic devices that provide force and tactile feedback to the student are programmed to generate physical interactions that improve student intuition for STEM subjects. Haptic devices also emphasize the need for interdisciplinary robotics education, and can inspire even very young stu- dents to enter STEM fields. In this paper, a variety of methods used by Johns Hopkins University researchers to incorporate haptic devices and simulations into un- dergraduate, graduate, and grade school curricula are reported.

abstract = {An analysis of force distributions for grasping by robot hands requires determination of contact forces between the fingers and the grasped object. This topic has been extensively investigated for fingertip grasps under the assumption that the fingers have enough joints so that contact forces can be actively controlled. This assumption is, however, not valid in power grasps for which the internal forces may have uncontrollable components. To ensure that the contact forces can be obtained by controlling the joint torques, the uncontrollable components must be separated from the internal forces. In this paper, a method is obtained to identify those power grasps for which the internal forces have uncontrollable components. A new formulation of contact forces is developed for the general solution to the force distribution of power grasps and provides a framework for optimization. The advantage of the approach is that the joint torques are explicitly considered, and, therefore, optimal contact forces can be achieved by modifying the joint torques},

In this paper we present the results of our work on modeling and examining patterns of student behavior with parameterized exercises using the Problem Solving Genome, a compact encapsulation of individual behavior patterns. We started with micro-patterns (genes) that describe small chunks of repetitive behavior and constructed individual genomes as frequency profiles that show the dominance of each gene in individual behavior. The exploration of student genomes revealed the individual genome is considerably stable, distinguishing students from their peers. Using the genome, we were able to analyze student behavior on the group level and identify genes associated with good and poor learning performance.},

The conventional CAD modeling approaches only provide geometry and topology of the object, but do not contain any information with regard to the materials of the object and so can not be used for the fabrication of heterogeneous objects (HO) through rapid prototyping. Current research focuses on computer-aided design issues in heterogeneous object design. A new CAD modeling approach is proposed to integrate the material information into geometric regions thus model the material distributions in the heterogeneous object. The gradient references are used to represent the complex geometry heterogeneous objects which have simultaneous geometry intricacies and accurate material distributions. The gradient references helps in flexible manipulability and control to heterogeneous objects, which guarantees the local control over gradient regions of developed heterogeneous objects. A systematic approach on data flow, processing, computer visualization, and slicing of heterogeneous objects for rapid prototyping is also presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents two planning methods for generating fast walking gaits for the quadruped robot RoboSimian and analyzes their feasibility and performance as a function of joint velocity limits. One approach uses a two-at-a-time swing leg motion gait, generated using preview control of the zero moment point (ZMP) on a narrow, double-support base of support. The second method uses a one-at-a-time swing leg crawl gait. We employ and compare both value iteration and gradient descent methods to generate the motions of the swing leg through free space for the crawl gait. For this gait, our optimization strategies exploit redundant degrees of freedom in the limb, which proves to increase walking speed significantly. By contrast, the ZMP-based gait requires nearly symmetric motions of the (fixed) stance legs and (free) swing legs with respect to the body, resulting in limited ability to improve the joint trajectories of the limbs through clever planning, and so an inverse kinematics (IK) table solution is used for all limb kinematics here. Our ZMP-based planning is only feasible if joint velocity limits are sufficiently large. Also, both the overall step size and speed of this gait vary nonlinearly as velocity limits increase. Lastly, comparing the two methods, we show that walking speed is faster using two-at-a-time swing leg motions when the joint velocity limit is between 1.62 and 3.62 rad/sec and that the crawl gait is optimal otherwise.},

abstract = {In robotic excavation, hybrid position/force control has been proposed for bucket digging trajectory following. In hybrid position/force control, the control mode is required to switch between position- and force-control depending on whether the bucket is in free space or in contact with the soil during the process. Alternatively, impedance control can be applied such that one control mode is employed in both free and constrained motion. This paper presents a robust sliding controller that implements impedance control for a backhoe excavator. The control law consists of three components: an equivalent control, a switching control and a tuning control. Given an excavation task in world space, inverse kinematic and dynamic models are used to convert the task into a desired digging trajectory in joint space. The proposed controller is applied to provide good tracking performance with attenuated vibration at bucket-soil contact points. From the control signals and the joint angles of the excavator, the piston position and ram force of each hydraulic cylinder for the axis control of the boom, arm, and bucket can be determined. The problem is then how to find the control voltage applied to each servovalve to achieve force and position tracking of each electrohydraulic system for the axis motion of the boom, arm, and bucket. With an observer-based compensation for disturbance force including hydraulic friction, tracking of the piston ram force and position is guaranteed using robust sliding control. High performance and strong robustness can be obtained as demonstrated by simulation and experiments performed on a hydraulically actuated robotic excavator. The results obtained suggest that the proposed control technique can provide robust performance when employed in autonomous excavation with soil contact considerations.},

Our framework takes as input a parameterized robot design and a motion plan consisting of trajectories for end-effectors, as well as optionally, for its body. The algorithm we propose is used to optimize design parameters, namely link lengths and the placement of actuators, while concurrently adjusting motion parameters such as joint trajectories, actuator inputs, and contact forces. Our key insight is that the complex relationship between design and motion parameters can be established via sensitivity analysis if the robot's movements are modeled as spatio-temporal solutions to optimal control problems. This relationship between form and function allows us to automatically optimize robot designs based on specifications expressed as a function of range of motion or actuator forces. We evaluate our model by computationally optimizing two simulated robots that employ linear actuators: a manipulator and a large quadruped. We further validate our framework by optimizing the design of a small quadrupedal robot and testing its performance using a hardware implementation.},

To confirm this explanation, we constructed a simple, single-joint robot that emulates the human drumming technique. McKibben “artificial muscle” pneumatic actuators were paired in an agonist-antagonist configuration, resulting in a slow robot with variable passive impedance. The robot can execute drum rolls across a frequency range comparable to human drumming (bounce interval=40-160 ms). The results demonstrate that modulation of passive impedance can permit a low bandwidth robot to execute certain types of fast manipulation tasks},

abstract = {The X2-VelociRoACH is a 54 gram experimental legged robot which was developed to test hypotheses about running with unnaturally high stride frequencies. It is capable of running at stride frequencies up to 45 Hz, and velocities up to 4.9 m/s, making it the fastest legged robot relative to size. The top speed of the robot was limited by structural failure. We present new methods and materials to make more robust folded robotic structures. High-frequency running experiments with the robot shows that the power required to cycle its running appendages increase cubically with the stride rate. Our findings show that although it is possible to further increase the maximum velocity of a legged robot with the simple strategy of increasing stride frequency, considerations must be made for the energetic demands of high stride rates.},

abstract = {As we seek to develop more maneuverable legged robots, we need to understand the dynamics of legged turning in an approachable fashion. In this work, we analyze the dynamic turning motion of a dynamic hexapedal millirobot. We explore a family of phase locked turning gaits where all legs of the robot move at the same speed. These gaits are highly periodic, allowing the vertical height and roll angle of the robot to be approximated by single harmonic sinusoidal functions. We demonstrate that oscillations in height and roll angle determine the robot's turning behavior. The phase between these oscillations (and therefore the turning behavior) was modulated by the phase between the left and right sets of legs. A simple model using compliant leg forces was shown to match turning behavior for a range of 5Hz turning gaits. Based on the finding that roll oscillations are major determinants of turning behavior, we modified the robot to create a new high speed turning gait (forward velocity: 0.4 m/s, turn rate 206°/s).},

In addition, we demonstrate that rotational dynamics become critical for stability as the scale of a robotic system is reduced. We present a new method of experimental dynamic tuning for legged millirobots, aimed at finding stable limit cycles with minimal rotational energy. By implementing an aerodynamic rotational damper, we further reduced the rotational energy in the system, and demonstrated that stable limit cycles with lower rotational energy are more robust to disturbances.

abstract = {Several arboreal mammals have the ability to rapidly and repeatedly jump vertical distances of 2 m, starting from rest. We characterize this performance by a metric we call vertical jumping agility. Through basic kinetic relations, we show that this agility metric is fundamentally constrained by available actuator power. Although rapid high jumping is an important performance characteristic, the ability to control forces during stance also appears critical for sophisticated behaviors. The animal with the highest vertical jumping agility, the galago (Galago senegalensis), is known to use a power-modulating strategy to obtain higher peak power than that of muscle alone. Few previous robots have used series-elastic power modulation (achieved by combining series-elastic actuation with variable mechanical advantage), and because of motor power limits, the best current robot has a vertical jumping agility of only 55% of a galago. Through use of a specialized leg mechanism designed to enhance power modulation, we constructed a jumping robot that achieved 78% of the vertical jumping agility of a galago. Agile robots can explore venues of locomotion that were not previously attainable. We demonstrate this with a wall jump, where the robot leaps from the floor to a wall and then springs off the wall to reach a net height that is greater than that accessible by a single jump. Our results show that series-elastic power modulation is an actuation strategy that enables a clade of vertically agile robots.},

abstract = {New work in robotics targets the development of controllable agile motions such as leaping. In this work, we examine animal and robotic systems on the metric of jumping agility and find that animals can outperform the most agile robots by a factor of two. These specially adapted animals use a jumping strategy we term power modulation to generate more peak power for jumping than otherwise possible. A novel eight-bar revolute mechanism designed with a new linkage synthesis approach encodes the properties for power modulation as well as constraints which assure rotation-free jumping motion. We fabricate an 85 gram prototype and demonstrate that it can perform a range of jumps while constrained by a linear slide. The prototype can deliver 3.63 times more peak jumping power than the maximum its motor can produce. A simulation matched to the physical parameters of the prototype predicts that the robot can attain an agility exceeding that of the most agile animals if the actuator power is increased to 15W.},

Materials chemists can harness these amazing structures as ready-made scaffolds on which to grow inorganic phases which replicate the underlying complexity, thereby producing materials with greatly enhanced physical properties. This book comprehensively describes the entire range of natural materials that have been used in this way and the inorganic phases which result from them. The book covers simple molecules such as cellulose and chitin, to large biological constructs such as bacterial proteins, viruses and pollen. Practically every inorganic material has been synthesized using biotemplating methods and the book reflects this, ranging from simple oxides and carbonates such as silica and calcite, to complex semi- and superconducting materials. The book also discusses the formation of these materials from a mechanistic point of view, thereby enabling the reader to better understand the processes involved in biotemplated mineralization.Contents: Simple Mono- and OligosaccharidesComplex PolysaccharidesHydrocolloidsChitin/ChitosanProteins and LipidsViruses and BacteriaComplex Biostructures as TemplatesInto the Future — Genetic Engineering and BeyondReadership: Postgraduates in chemistry and materials science; academics, researchers.Keywords:Biotemplating;Bioceramics;Chemistry;Materials Science;BiomimeticsKey Features:Unlike previous books, Biotemplating describes a variety of state-of-the-art methods for converting biogenic templates into functional inorganic materials while preserving the morphologies of the biogenic templatesThe text is accessible to specialists and non-specialists alikeWhile there are other books covering the general subject areas of biomimetics and biomineralization, there are no other books emphasising solely on biotemplating},

abstract = {Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), based on already well-researched Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), has been under vigorous scrutiny since recent developments in robot technology. Robots may be more successful in establishing common ground in project-based education or foreign language learning for children than in traditional media. Backed by its strong IT environment and advances in robot technology, Korea has developed the world's first available e-Learning home robot. This has demonstrated the potential for robots to be used as a new educational media - robot-learning, referred to as ‘r-Learning'. Robot technology is expected to become more interactive and user-friendly than computers. Also, robots can exhibit various forms of communication such as gestures, motions and facial expressions. This study compared the effects of non-computer based (NCB) media (using a book with audiotape) and Web-Based Instruction (WBI), with the effects of Home Robot-Assisted Learning (HRL) for children. The robot gestured and spoke in English, and children could touch its monitor if it did not recognize their voice command. Compared to other learning programs, the HRL was superior in promoting and improving children's concentration, interest, and academic achievement. In addition, the children felt that a home robot was friendlier than other types of instructional media. The HRL group had longer concentration spans than the other groups, and the p-value demonstrated a significant difference in concentration among the groups. In regard to the children's interest in learning, the HRL group showed the highest level of interest, the NCB group and the WBI group came next in order. Also, academic achievement was the highest in the HRL group, followed by the WBI group and the NCB group respectively. However, a significant difference was also found in the children's academic achievement among the groups. These results suggest that home robots are more effective as regards children's learning concentration, learning interest and academic achievement than other types of instructional media (such as: books with audiotape and WBI) for English as a foreign language.

abstract = {This paper presents quantification of multidimensional ankle stability in relation to mechanical environments having different levels of stability. This study, for the first time, explores the range of stiffness-defined haptic environments over which young healthy individuals can maintain stability despite aggressive perturbation. Ankle stability was quantified in 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) of the ankle, in both the sagittal and frontal planes. Importantly, the magnitude of negative environmental stiffness that the subjects could maintain stability is 4 times as great in the sagittal plane as in the frontal plane. In addition to managing a wider range of unstable environments in the sagittal plane, subjects were also more efficient at regaining stability after perturbation and less sensitive to changes in the environmental stiffness. Outcomes of this study would be beneficial to the design and control of robots physically interacting with human lower extremities, such as lower-limb exoskeletons and powered ankle-foot orthoses.},

abstract = {Soft robotic technologies have been widely used in the fields like bio-robotics, wearable devices, and industrial manipulations. However, existing soft robots usually require multiple pneumatic/fluidic channels for pressurizing soft material segments in series or in parallel to achieve multiple mechanical degrees of freedom. In this study, we demonstrated a soft actuator embedded with Low-Melting-Point Alloy (LMPA), with which the mechanical degrees and stiffness can be selectively controlled. The LMPA was embedded in the bottom of the actuator, with the Ni-Cr wires serpentining under different positions of the LMPA layer. Through a reheating- recrystallizing circle, the actuator can self-heal and recover from the crack state. The melting process of the LMPA under different currents and different sections, the variable stiffness, the self-healing properties, and the programmable mechanical freedom of the actuator was explored through experiments. The results showed that the LMPA could be melted about 10, s under the current of 0.7, A. With the LMPA, the bending force and the elasticity modulus of the actuator could be enhanced up to 16 times and 4,000 times separately. Moreover, up to six motion patterns could be achieved under the same air pressure inflated to a typical single-chamber soft actuator. The combination of Low-Melting-Point Alloy and the soft actuators may open up a diversity of applications for future soft robotics.},

abstract = {The monkey premotor cortex contains neurons that discharge during action execution and during observation of actions made by others. Transcranial magnetic stimulation experiments suggest that a similar observation/execution matching system also is present in humans. We recorded neuromagnetic oscillatory activity of the human precentral cortex from 10 healthy volunteers while (i) they had no task to perform, (ii) they were manipulating a small object, and (iii) they were observing another individual performing the same task. The left and right median nerves were stimulated alternately (interstimulus interval, 1.5 s) at intensities exceeding motor threshold, and the poststimulus rebound of the rolandic 15- to 25-Hz activity was quantified. In agreement with previous studies, the rebound was strongly suppressed bilaterally during object manipulation. Most interestingly, the rebound also was significantly diminished during action observation (31-46% of the suppression during object manipulation). Control experiments, in which subjects were instructed to observe stationary or moving stimuli, confirmed the specificity of the suppression effect. Because the recorded 15- to 25-Hz activity is known to originate mainly in the precentral motor cortex, we concluded that the human primary motor cortex is activated during observation as well as execution of motor tasks. These findings have implications for a better understanding of the machinery underlying action recognition in humans.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art robotic perception systems have achieved sufficiently good performance using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), cameras, and nonlinear optimization techniques, that they are now being deployed as technologies. However, many of these methods rely significantly on vision and often fail when visual tracking is lost due to lighting or scarcity of features. This paper presents a state-estimation technique for legged robots that takes into account the robot's kinematic model as well as its contact with the environment. We introduce forward kinematic factors and preintegrated contact factors into a factor graph framework that can be incrementally solved in real-time. The forward kinematic factor relates the robot's base pose to a contact frame through noisy encoder measurements. The preintegrated contact factor provides odometry measurements of this contact frame while accounting for possible foot slippage. Together, the two developed factors constrain the graph optimization problem allowing the robot's trajectory to be estimated. The paper evaluates the method using simulated and real sensory IMU and kinematic data from experiments with a Cassie-series robot designed by Agility Robotics. These preliminary experiments show that using the proposed method in addition to IMU decreases drift and improves localization accuracy, suggesting that its use can enable successful recovery from a loss of visual tracking.},

First, d.tools introduces a statechart-based visual design tool that provides a low threshold for early-stage prototyping, extensible through code for higher-fidelity prototypes. Second, our research introduces three important types of hardware extensibility - at the hardware-to-PC interface, the intra-hardware communication level, and the circuit level. Third, d.tools integrates design, test, and analysis of information appliances. We have evaluated d.tools through three studies: a laboratory study with thirteen participants; rebuilding prototypes of existing and emerging devices; and by observing seven student teams who built prototypes with d.tools.},

However, the control algorithms are difficult to be used for human-carrying biped walking robots because of modeling errors. In this paper, a landing pattern modification method is proposed which based on nonlinear compliance control. Theoretical compliance displacements calculated from a walking pattern are compared with the actual compliance displacements, while a robot's foot touches slightly uneven terrain. In result, the height of landing terrain is detected, and the preset walking pattern is modified. Using this method, a human-carrying biped robot would be able to walk stably on uneven terrain. This pattern modification method does not need any special sensors except force sensors. Through various walking experiments, the effectiveness of the method is confirmed},

In doing so, they provide powerful, intuitive representations of the bounds on a system's locomotion capabilities and the forms of its optimal strokes or gaits. While this approach has been successful for finding net rotations, noncommutativity concerns have prevented it from working for net translations. Our recent results on other locomoting systems have shown that the degree of this noncommutativity is dependent on the coordinates used to describe the problem and that it can be greatly mitigated by an optimal choice of coordinates. Here, we extend the benefits of this optimal-coordinate approach to the analysis of swimming at the extremes of low and high Reynolds numbers. {\textcopyright} 2004-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we explore how ideas from cartography can be used to identify system parameterizations that better reflect the effort costs of changing configuration.

abstract = {In robotics, controlling the stiffness of the joints that contribute to the robots' degree of freedom dictates the adaptability, versatility, and safety of the whole system. We can achieve variable stiffness or impedance in a robotic system purely by the control or by introducing new material or mechanisms to address cases that require innate safety through system compliancy. This paper presents JammJoint, a compliant and flexible wearable robot, which uses jamming of granular media to vary its stiffness. It consists of a silicone sleeve with hollow sections that are filled with cubic rubber granules and subjected to different levels of vacuum pressure. Unlike contemporary vacuum-based actuators or systems, JammJoint is wearable, portable, and autonomous: It uses a powerful miniature vacuum pump, a small battery, and bluetooth-enabled electronics. Experiments revolving around bending and torsional stiffness show that the system is able to achieve up to a fourfold increase in spring stiffness. Further measurements of individual variable stiffness structures indicate that for other modes of deformation, including simply supported bending or compression for alternative linear applications, higher changes in stiffness over a factor of seven are possible. These aspects make mobile jamming-based stiffness variation as wearable joint assistance promising for future applications such as rehabilitation after injuries and joint support in challenging working conditions.},

abstract = {Programmable matter is a material whose properties can be programmed to achieve specific shapes or stiffnesses upon command. This concept requires constituent elements to interact and rearrange intelligently in order to meet the goal. This paper considers achieving programmable sheets that can form themselves in different shapes autonomously by folding. Past approaches to creating transforming machines have been limited by the small feature sizes, the large number of components, and the associated complexity of communication among the units. We seek to mitigate these difficulties through the unique concept of self-folding origami with universal crease patterns. This approach exploits a single sheet composed of interconnected triangular sections. The sheet is able to fold into a set of predetermined shapes using embedded actuation. To implement this self-folding origami concept, we have developed a scalable end-to-end planning and fabrication process. Given a set of desired objects, the system computes an optimized design for a single sheet and multiple controllers to achieve each of the desired objects. The material, called programmable matter by folding, is an example of a system capable of achieving multiple shapes for multiple functions.},

abstract = {Wings have long been regarded as a hallmark of evolutionary innovation, allowing insects, birds, and bats to radiate into aerial environments. For many groups, our intuitive and colloquial perspective is that wings function for aerial activities, and legs for terrestrial, in a relatively independent manner. However, insects and birds often engage their wings and legs cooperatively. In addition, the degree of autonomy between wings and legs may be constrained by tradeoffs, between allocating resources to wings versus legs during development, or between wing versus leg investment and performance (because legs must be carried as baggage by wings during flight and vice versa). Such tradeoffs would profoundly affect the development and evolution of locomotor strategies, and many related aspects of animal ecology. Here, we provide the first evaluation of wing versus leg investment, performance and relative use, in birds—both across species, and during ontogeny in three precocial species with different ecologies. Our results suggest that tradeoffs between wing and leg modules help shape ontogenetic and evolutionary trajectories, but can be offset by recruiting modules cooperatively. These findings offer a new paradigm for exploring locomotor strategies of flying organisms and their extinct precursors, and thereby elucidating some of the most spectacular diversity in animal history.},

Design/methodology/approach A series of simple models are proposed which capture the dynamics of an idealized running system with an active tail. These models suggest that the overall control problem can be simplified and effectively decoupled via a proper tail design. This design principle is further explored in simulation using trajectory optimization. The results are then validated in hardware using a one degree-of-freedom active tail mounted on the quadruped robot Cheetah-Cub. Findings The results of this paper show that an active tail can greatly improve both forward velocity and reduce body-pitch per stride while adding minimal complexity. Further, the results validate the design principle of using long, light tails compared to shorter heavier ones. Originality/value This paper builds...},

Plausible answers to these questions are investigated and reviewed,\nnotions and concepts to be used or to be taken into account are developed and\nsome challenging questions are posed as open problems.

abstract = {Although the effects of body size on mammalian locomotion are well documented, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we present a computational model of the mechanics, control and energetics that unifies some well-known scale effects in running quadrupeds. The model consists of dynamic, physics-based simulations of six running mammals ranging in size from a chipmunk to a horse (0.115-676 kg). The 'virtual animals' are made up of rigid segments (head, trunk and four legs) linked by joints and are similar in morphology to particular species. In the model, each stance limb acts as a spring operating within a narrow range of stiffness, forward motion is powered and controlled by active hip and shoulder torques, and metabolic cost is predicted from the time course of supporting body weight. Model parameters that are important for stability (joint stiffnesses, limb-retraction times and target positions and velocities of the limbs) are selected such that (i) running kinematics (aerial height, forward speed and body pitch) is smooth and periodic and (ii) overall leg stiffness is in agreement with published data. Both trotting and galloping gaits are modeled, and comparisons across size are made at speeds that are physiologically similar among species. Model predictions are in agreement with data on vertical stiffness, limb angles, metabolic cost of transport, stride frequency, peak force and duty factor. This work supports the idea that a single, integrative model can predict important features of running across size by employing simple strategies to control overall leg stiffness. More broadly, the model provides a quantitative framework for testing hypotheses that relate limb control, stability and metabolic cost.},

abstract = {There remains a need for rapid, specific and sensitive assays for the detection of bacterial indicators for water quality monitoring. In this study, a strategy for rapid detection of Escherichia coli in drinking water has been developed. This strategy is based on the use of the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-$\beta$- d-glucuronide (MUG), which is hydrolyzed rapidly by the action of E. coli $\beta$- d-glucuronidase (GUD) enzyme to yield a fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) product that can be quantified and related to the number of E. coli cells present in water samples. In this study, the detection time required for the biosensor response ranged between 20 and 120. min, depending on the number of bacteria in the sample. This approach does not need extensive sample processing with a rapid detection capability. The specificity of the MUG substrate was examined in both, pure cultures of non-target bacterial genera such as Klebsiella, Salmonella, Enterobacter and Bacillus. Non-target substrates that included 4-methylumbelliferyl-$\beta$- d-galactopyranoside (MUGal) and l-leucine $\beta$-naphthylamide aminopeptidase (LL$\beta$-N) were also investigated to identify nonspecific patterns of enzymatic activities in E. coli. GUD activity was found to be specific for E. coli and no further enzymatic activity was detected by other species. In addition, fluorescence assays were performed for the detection of E. coli to generate standard curves; and the sensitivity of the GUD enzymatic response was measured and repeatedly determined to be less than 10 E. coli cells in a reaction vial. The applicability of the method was tested by performing multiple fluorescence assays under pure and mixed bacterial flora in environmental samples. The results of this study showed that the fluorescence signals generated in samples using specific substrate molecules can be utilized to develop a bio-sensing platform for the detection of E. coli in drinking water. Furthermore, this system can be applied independently or in conjunction with other methods as a part of an array of biochemical assays in order to reliably detect E. coli in water.},

Subterranean rodents representing four genera from three families (East-Mediterranean Spalax, African Cryptomys and Heterocephalus, and South American Spalacopus), tested in T-mazes filled with soil in which edible plants either had or had not been growing, used odours to discriminate between the soils and chose to dig in the soil containing odorous substances (kairomones) released from roots of growing plants. Such discriminations could enable them to orienttheir digging toward food sources in the field and thus to improve their foraging efficiency. Spalax blind mole-rats also discriminated between the odours from soil in which edible as opposed to poisonous plants had been growing. These species evolved independently on three continents; thus their abilities probably are characteristic of subterranean rodents in general.},

abstract = {The advent of multi-material freeform fabrication technologies has exponentially increased the mechanical design space available to engineers. The feature-based paradigm of traditional CAD software is insufficient to take advantage of the freedom of internal material distribution and gradients. Here we present a flexible evolutionary design algorithm for 3D multi-material structures that fully utilizes this expanded design space. The material distribution is optimized subject to high level functional constraints, or simple constraints such as maximizing stiffness per weight. The algorithm is inherently capable of shape optimization, or can simply optimize material distribution within a given geometry. We demonstrate autonomous design of freeform shapes, 3D non-uniform structures, and 3D compliant actuators.},

abstract = {This paper describes a 2D and 3D simulation engine that quantitatively models the statics, dynamics, and non-linear deformation of heterogeneous soft bodies in a computationally efficient manner. There is a large body of work simulating compliant mechanisms. These normally assume small deformations with homogeneous material properties actuated with external forces. There is also a large body of research on physically-based deformable objects for applications in computer graphics with the purpose of generating realistic appearances at the expense of accuracy. Here we present a simulation framework in which an object may be composed of any number of interspersed materials with varying properties (stiffness, density, etc.) to enable true heterogeneous multi-material simulation. Collisions are handled to prevent self-penetration due to large deformation, which also allows multiple bodies to interact. A volumetric actuation method is implemented to impart motion to the structures which opens the door to the design of novel structures and mechanisms. The simulator was implemented efficiently such that objects with thousands of degrees of freedom can be simulated at suitable framerates for user interaction using a single thread of a typical desktop computer. The code is written in platform agnostic C++ and is fully open source. This research opens the door to the dynamic simulation of freeform 3D multi-material mechanisms and objects in a manner suitable for design automation.},

abstract = {Purpose – Virtual voxels (3D pixels) have traditionally been used as a graphical data structure for representing 3D geometry. The purpose of this paper is to study the use of pre-existing physical voxels as a material building-block for layered manufacturing and present the theoretical underpinnings for a fundamentally new massively parallel additive fabrication process in which 3D matter is digital. The paper also seeks to explore the unique possibilities enabled by this paradigm. Design/methodology/approach – Digital RP is a process whereby a physical 3D object is made of many digital units (voxels) arranged selectively in a 3D lattice, as opposed to analog (continuous) material commonly used in conventional rapid prototyping. The paper draws from fundamentals of 3D space-filling shapes, large-scale numerical simulation, and a survey of modern technology to reach conclusions on the feasibility of a fabricator for digital matter. Findings – Design criteria and appropriate 3D voxel geometries are presented that self-align and are suitable for rapid parallel assembly and economical manufacturing. Theory and numerical simulation predict dimensional accuracy to scale favorably as the number of voxels increases. Current technology will enable rapid parallel assembly of billions of microscale voxels. Research limitations/implications – Many novel voxel functions could be realized in the electromechanical and microfluidic domains, enabling inexpensive prototyping of complex 3D integrated systems. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of a 3D digital fabricator, but an instantiation is out of scope and left to future work. Practical implications – Digital manufacturing offers the possibility of desktop fabrication of perfectly repeatable, precise, multi-material objects with microscale accuracy. Originality/value – The paper constitutes a comprehensive review of physical voxel-based manufacturing and presents the groundwork for an emerging new field of additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {Purpose – Digital materials are composed of many discrete voxels placed in a massively parallel layer deposition process, as opposed to continuous (analog) deposition techniques. The purpose of this paper is to explore the wide range of material properties attainable using a voxel-based freeform fabrication process, and demonstrate in simulation the versatility of fabricating with multiple materials in this manner. Design/methodology/approach – A representative interlocking voxel geometry was selected, and a nonlinear physics simulator was implemented to perform virtual tensile tests on blocks of assembled voxels of varying materials. Surface contact between tiles, plastic deformation of the individual voxels, and varying manufacturing precision were all modeled. Findings – By varying the precision, geometry, and material of the individual voxels, continuous control over the density, elastic modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, ductility, and failure mode of the material is obtained. Also, the effects of several hierarchical voxel “microstructures” are demonstrated, resulting in interesting properties such as negative Poisson's ratio. Research limitations/implications – This analysis is a case study of a specific voxel geometry, which is representative of 2.5D interlocking shapes but not necessarily all types of interlocking voxels. Practical implications – The results imply that digital materials can exhibit widely varying and tunable properties in a single desktop fabrication process. Originality/value – The paper explores the vast potential of tunable materials, especially using the concept of voxel microstructure, applicable primarily to 3D voxel printers but also to other multi-material freeform fabrication processes.},

Recent advances in multimaterial fabrication techniques enable continuous shapes to be fabricated with unprecedented fidelity unhindered by spatial constraints and homogeneous materials. We address the challenges of exploitation of the freedom of this vast new design space using evolutionary algorithms. We first show a set of cantilever beams automatically designed to deflect in arbitrary static profiles using hard and soft materials. These beams were automatically fabricated, and their physical performance was confirmed within 0.5-7.6% accuracy. We then demonstrate the automatic design of freeform soft robots for forward locomotion using soft volumetrically expanding actuator materials. One robot was fabricated automatically and assembled, and its performance was confirmed with 15% error. We suggest that this approach to design automation opens the door to leveraging the full potential of the freeform multimaterial design space to generate novel mechanisms and deformable robots.},

abstract = {Figure 1. DextrES is a flexible and thin form-factor haptic feedback mechanism for precise manipulation of virtual objects in VR and AR. a) Our approach provides kinesthetic feedback via electrostatic brakes and piezoelectric actuators for cutaneous feedback. b) We experimentally show that DextrES improves precision of virtual object manipulations in VR across c) a number of different types of grasps, each affording different hand poses. ABSTRACT We introduce DextrES, a flexible and wearable haptic glove which integrates both kinesthetic and cutaneous feedback in a thin and light form factor (weight is less than 8g). Our approach is based on an electrostatic clutch generating up to 20 N of holding force on each finger by modulating the electro-static attraction between flexible elastic metal strips to generate an electrically-controlled friction force. We harness the resulting braking force to rapidly render on-demand kines-thetic feedback. The electrostatic brake is mounted onto the the index finger and thumb via modular 3D printed articulated guides which allow the metal strips to glide smoothly. Cuta-neous feedback is provided via piezo actuators at the fingertips. We demonstrate that our approach can provide rich hap-tic feedback under dexterous articulation of the user's hands and provides effective haptic feedback across a variety of different grasps. A controlled experiment indicates that Dex-trES improves the grasping precision for different types of virtual objects. Finally, we report on results of a psycho-physical study which identifies discrimination thresholds for different levels of holding force. † Authors contributed equally to this work.},

abstract = {This paper describes a miniature robot finger which uses shape memory alloy as the actuator. Aiming at developing robot hands to perform human work instead of men, numerous researches have been conducted. By miniaturizing robot hands, execution of more detailed work becomes possible. In developing miniature robot hands for dexterous manipulation, it is necessary to consider miniaturizing and simplification. The miniature robot finger proposed in this paper is driven by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. The structure of the robot finger imitates the musculoskeletal system of humans, since SMA wires exhibit nonlinear features similar to human muscles. Highly precise position control of fingertip is performable by using SMA owing to its shape memory effect. Force control of the fingertip is performed by measuring the tension of the SMA wire. We used strain gages to measure tension. We confirmed that stiffness control of the finger joint can be conducted by controlling tension of the SMA simultaneously.},

Combined with continuous powerplant development, the structures of " flying machines " have changed significantly. The key discovery that " lift " could be created by passing air over the top of a curved surface set the development of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft in motion. George Cayley developed an efficient cambered airfoil in the early 1800s, as well as successful manned gliders later in that century. He established the principles of flight, including the existence of lift, weight, thrust, and drag. It was Cayley who first stacked wings and created a tri-wing glider that flew a man in 1853.},

abstract = {Body undulation used by snakes and the physical architecture of a snake body may offer significant benefits over typical legged or wheeled locomotion designs in certain types of scenarios. A large number of research groups have developed snake-inspired robots to exploit these benefits. The purpose of this review is to report different types of snake-inspired robot designs and categorize them based on their main characteristics. For each category, we discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages. This review will assist in familiarizing a newcomer to the field with the existing designs and their distinguishing features. We hope that by studying existing robots, future designers will be able to create new designs by adopting features from successful robots. The review also summarizes the design challenges associated with the further advancement of the field and deploying snake-inspired robots in practice.},

@article{Hoque2013,
abstract = {The main contribution of the work is to develop an intelligent system for manufacturing features in the area of CAD/CAM. It brings the design and manufacturing phase together in design stage and provides an intelligent interface between design and manufacturing data by developing a library of features. The library is called manufacturing feature library which is linked with commercial CAD/CAM software package named Creo Elements/Pro by toolkit. Inside the library, manufacturing features are organised hierarchically. A systematic database system also have been developed and analysed for each feature consists of parameterised geometry, manufacturing information (including machine tool, cutting tools, cutting conditions, cutting fluids and recommended tolerances and surface finishing values, etc.), design limitations, functionality guidelines, and Design-for-manufacture guidelines. The approach has been applied in two case studies in which a rotational part (shaft) and a non-rotational part are designed through manufacturing features. Therefore, from manufacturing feature library a design can compose entirely in a bottom-up manner using manufacturable entities in the same way as they would be produced during the manufacturing phase. Upon insertion of a feature, the system ensures that no functionality or manufacturing guidelines are violated. The designers are warned if they attempt to include features that violate Design-for- manufacture and Design functionality guidelines. If a feature is modified, the system validates the feature by making sure that it remains consistent with its original functionality and Design-for-manufacture guidelines are re-applied. The system will be helped the process planner/manufacturing engineer by automatically creating work-piece data structure. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Hornby2003,
abstract = { The field of evolutionary robotics has demonstrated the ability to automatically design the morphology and controller of simple physical robots through synthetic evolutionary processes. However, it is not clear if variation-based search processes can attain the complexity of design necessary for practical engineering of robots. Here, we demonstrate an automatic design system that produces complex robots by exploiting the principles of regularity, modularity, hierarchy, and reuse. These techniques are already established principles of scaling in engineering design and have been observed in nature, but have not been broadly used in artificial evolution. We gain these advantages through the use of a generative representation, which combines a programmatic representation with an algorithmic process that compiles the representation into a detailed construction plan. This approach is shown to have two benefits: it can reuse components in regular and hierarchical ways, providing a systematic way to create more complex modules from simpler ones; and the evolved representations can capture intrinsic properties of the design space, so that variations in the representations move through the design space more effectively than equivalent-sized changes in a nongenerative representation. Using this system, we demonstrate for the first time the evolution and construction of modular, three-dimensional, physically locomoting robots, comprising many more components than previous work on body-brain evolution.},

abstract = {An antagonistic muscle mechanism that regulates joint compliance contributes enormously to human dynamic locomotion. Antagonism is considered to be the key for realizing more than one locomotion mode. In this paper, we demonstrate how antagonistic pneumatic actuators can be utilized to achieve three dynamic locomotion modes (walking, jumping, and running) in a biped robot. Firstly, we discuss the contribution of joint compliance to dynamic locomotion, which highlights the importance of tunable compliance. Secondly, we introduce the design of a biped robot powered by antagonistic pneumatic actuators. Lastly, we apply simple feedforward controllers for realizing walking, jumping, and running and confirm the contribution of joint compliance to such multimodal dynamic locomotion. Based on the results, we can conclude that the antagonistic pneumatic actuators are superior candidates for constructing a human-like dynamic locomotor. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Although Denis Healey's famous adage (Metcalfe 2007) may offer sound advice for politicians, it is less relevant to worms, clams, and other higher organisms that rely on their digging ability for survival. In this article, we review recent work on the development of simple models that elucidate the fundamental principles underlying digging and burrowing strategies employed by biological systems. Four digging regimes are identified based on dimensionless digger size and the dimensionless inertial number. We select biological organisms to represent three of the four regimes: razor clams, sandfish, and nematodes. Models for all three diggers are derived and discussed, and analogies are drawn to low?Reynolds number swimmers.},

abstract = {Are the different energy-conserving mechanics (i.e., pendulum and spring) used in different gaits reflected in differences in energetics and/or stride parameters? The analysis included published data from several species and new data from horses. When changing from pendulum to spring mechanics, there is a change in the slope of metabolic rate (MR) vs. speed in all species, in birds and quadrupeds there is no step increase, and in humans there are conflicting reports. At the trot-gallop transition, where quadrupeds are hypothesized to change from spring mechanics to some combination of spring and pendulum mechanics, there is a change in slope of MR vs. speed in horses but not in other species. Stride frequency (SF) is a logarithmic function of walking speed in all species, a linear function of trotting/running speed, and nearly independent of speed in galloping. In humans and horses there is a discontinuity in SF at the walk-trot (run) transition but not in birds. The slope of time of contact vs. speed does not change with mechanics in most species, but it does in humans. In horses and humans, there is a discontinuity at the walk-trot (run) transition and data for other species do not permit generalization. Duty factor (DF) in humans is greater than 0.5 in walking (pendulum mechanics) and less than 0.5 when running (spring mechanics). However, this is not true in many species that have DF>0.5 at the lowest speeds where they use spring mechanics. When trotting at low speeds, horses use forelimb DF>0.5 and hind limb DF<0.5. Thus, it is confusing to distinguish between walking and running by DF.},

The motion of a rigid body in general consists of translation and orientation. The former is described by a space curve in three-dimensional Euclidean space while the latter is represented by a curve in the unit quaternion space. By adopting the geometric approach, the smoothness of both translation data and orientation data is measured from the strain energy perspective and a nonlinear optimization problem is formulated that aims to minimize the weighted sum of the strain-energy and the sum of the squared errors. A hybrid algorithm that combines genetic algorithms and local search schemes is deployed to solve this optimization problem and the experiments show that both smoothness and shape preservation of the resulting motion can be achieved by the proposed algorithm. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The method converts the related CPG parameters into dynamic systems that evolve as part of the CPG network dynamics. The frequency, amplitude, and phase relations of teaching signals can be encoded by the CPG network with the proposed learning rules. The ability of the method to learn instructed locomotor pattern is proven with simulations. Application of the proposed method to online gait synthesis of a robotic fish is also presented.},

We further investigate a decentralized control method in target-tracking and collision-avoidance task for two autonomous robotic fish. Most of previous work on the task strategies of autonomous robots is focused on terrestrial robots and seldom deals with underwater applications due to the uncertainties and complexity in a hydroenvironment. To address this challenge in such an underwater task, a situated-behavior-based decentralized control is employed on each robotic fish according to its visual data. On dealing with motion planning of the fish during target tracking and collision avoidance, a control law by a combination of an attractive force toward a target and a repulsive force for collision avoidance is utilized. Experimental results of the task performed by two autonomous robotic fish validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

However, owing to the current limitations in simulation, design and control of soft robots often involve a painstaking trial. With the ultimate goal of a computational framework for soft robotic engineering, here we introduce a numerical simulation tool for limbed soft robots that draws inspiration from discrete differential geometry based simulation of slender structures. The simulation incorporates an implicit treatment of the elasticity of the limbs, inelastic collision between a soft body and rigid surface, and unilateral contact and Coulombic friction with an uneven surface. The computational efficiency of the numerical method enables it to run faster than real-time on a desktop processor. Our experiments and simulations show quantitative agreement and indicate the potential role of predictive simulations for soft robot design.},

We outline the mechanisms and design choices necessary to meet these speciﬁcations, particularly ATRIAS' four-bar series-elastic leg design. We experimentally demonstrate the following robot capabilities, which are characteristics of the target model. 1) We present the robot's physical capability for both grounded and aerial gaits, including planar walking and sustained hopping, while being more efﬁcient than similarly gait-versatile bipeds. 2) The robot can be controlled by enforcing quantities derived from the simpler spring-mass model, such as leg angles and leg forces. 3) ATRIAS replicates the center-of-mass dynamics of human hopping and (novelly) walking, a key spring-mass model feature. Lastly, we present dynamically stable stepping in 3D without external support, demonstrating that this theoretical model has practical potential for real-world locomotion.},

abstract = {The concept of isogeometric analysis is proposed. Basis functions generated from NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are employed to construct an exact geometric model. For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection-diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Hurst2008,
abstract = {Many robots excel at precise positioning and trajectory tracking using software control, and most successful robotic applications utilize this ability-examples include CNC machining, robotic welding, painting, and pick-and-place circuit board assembly. The mechanical design of these robots focuses on rigid transmissions and minimizing compliance in the structure, so the software controller can accurately track a desired position as a function of time, regardless of any disturbance forces. However, there is a class of tasks for which rigid actuation is not ideal: physical interaction with the world, especially interaction that involves an impact or kinetic energy transfer. Animals tend to excel at these tasks, and far outperform the best robots. Examples include walking, running, catching a ball, gripping a piece of fruit firmly but without causing damage, and many types of assembly tasks. For dynamic behaviors such as running, the performance limitations of a robot are often due to limitations of the mechanical design. A robot is an integrated system of electronics, software, and mechanism, and each part of the system limits or enables the behavior of the whole. While some behaviors can easily be implemented through simple actuators and direct software control, a running machine requires mechanical design that is specialized for the task. Among other things, physical springs are essential for a robust and efficient running gait, to store energy, provide high mechanical power, and overcome bandwidth limitations of traditional actuators. An ideal kinematic design, where the joints and links are perfectly sized and placed for the desired task, and motors that exceed the force and speed requirements of the task are not sufficient for successful dynamic interactions. Inertia, transmission friction, and other dynamic effects have a significant role in the behavior of a robot. We are building running and walking machines with a focus on mechanical design to enable efficient and robust gaits. The defining characteristic of a running gait is spring-like behavior; all running animals, from small insects to large mammals, exhibit a center-of-mass motion that resembles a bouncing ball or a pogo stick. The spring-like behavior is implemented with the assistance of physical springy elements, such as tendons, and not entirely through software or neural control. Energy cycles back and forth between the ballistic trajectory of the body and the compression of the leg spring. To exhibit this behavior, our robots incorporate a mechanical spring that is tuned to absorb and release the energy of a running gait at the appropriate frequency. Electric motors act in series with this spring to add or remove energy from the cycle to modify or control the running gait. Our first prototype machine is a single actuator mounted to a bench, called the Actuator with Mechanically Adjustable Series Compliance, or AMASC. The stiffness and the no-load position of the joint are mechanical configurations that can be independently adjusted using two separate motors, and it is a test platform to verify and refine several design ideas for leg joints of running and walking robots. After significant testing and design, revision, we incorporated the ideas behind the AMASC into the design of a full bipedal robot, the Biped with Mechanically Adjustable Series Compliance, or BiMASC. A single leg prototype of the BiMASC was constructed and tested, and after some final revisions, we have built the Electric Cable Differential (ECD) Leg. The ECD Leg derives its name from the construction-using electric motors, cable drives, and mechanical differentials to actuate the system. One ECD Leg, named Thumper, is assembled as a monopod and installed in our laboratory at the Robotics Institute to study the role of compliance in running gaits. Two ECD Legs are assembled as a biped named MABEL, which is installed in Professor Jessy Grizzle's Laboratory at the University of Michigan and will serve as a platform to explore novel control ideas. In this thesis, we demonstrate that physical springs are extremely important for supporting a running gait. Additionally, through experiments on the ECD Leg, we demonstrate that there is an energetically optimal leg stiffness. The design and construction of the robots in this thesis are an exploration of methods for adjusting the leg stiffness to obtain the optimal stiffness for a running gait. The AMASC and BiMASC utilize co-contraction of antagonistic springs to tune the stiffness to a desired value. The ECD leg, in contrast, utilizes both active control of the motor and kinematic adjustments to control the stiffness behavior of the leg. We suggest that that co-contraction of antagonistic springs is energetically expensive, and that active control of a leg to modify its inherent stiffness might be energetically cheaper, with the same functionality. The ECD leg successfully hopped in place, as well as at speed. Thumper and MABEL demonstrate, for the first time, a cable drive paired with series elasticity for a running machine. The AMASC is the first demonstration of series elasticity implemented via a mechanical differential, and the BIMASC, Thumper, and MABEL all utilize this same concept. The mechanical design of the ECD leg contains many novel ideas that will be utilized in future walking and running machines.},

abstract = {I used a simple mathematical model of the inverse dynamics of locomotion to estimate the minimum muscle masses required to maintain quasi-static equilibrium about the four main limb joints at mid-stance of fast running. Models of 10 extant taxa (a human, a kangaroo, two lizards, an alligator, and five birds) were analyzed in various bipedal poses to examine how anatomy, size, limb orientation, and other model parameters influence running ability. I examined how the muscle masses required for fast running compare to the muscle masses that are actually able to exert moments about the hip, knee, ankle, and toe joints, to see how support ability varies across the limb. I discuss the assumptions and limitations of the models, using sensitivity analysis to see how widely the results differed with feasible parameter input values. Even with a wide range of input values, the models validated the analysis procedure. Animals that are known to run bipedally were calculated as able to preserve quasi-static equilibrium about their hindlimb joints at mid-stance, whereas non-bipedal runners (iguanas and alligators) were recognized as having too little muscle mass to run quickly in bipedal poses. Thus, this modeling approach should be reliable for reconstructing running ability in extinct bipeds such as nonavian dinosaurs. The models also elucidated how key features are important for bipedal running capacity, such as limb orientation, muscle moment arms, muscle fascicle lengths, and body size. None of the animals modeled had extensor muscle masses acting about any one joint that were 7% or more of their body mass, which provides a reasonable limit for how much muscle mass is normally apportioned within a limb to act about a particular joint. The models consistently showed that a key biomechanical limit on running ability is the capacity of ankle extensors to generate sufficiently large joint moments. Additionally, the analysis reveals how large ratite birds remain excellent runners despite their larger size; they have apomorphically large extensor muscles with relatively high effective mechanical advantage. Finally, I reconstructed the evolution of running ability in the clade Reptilia, showing that the ancestors of extant birds likely were quite capable runners, even though they had already reduced key hip extensors such as M. caudofemoralis longus.},

Recently, mouldless manufacturing techniques, known as solid free-form fabrication (SFF), or rapid prototyping, have been successfully used to fabricate complex scaffolds. Similarly, to achieve simultaneous addition of cells during the scaffold fabrication, novel robotic assembly and automated 3D cell encapsulation techniques are being developed. As a result of these technologies, tissue-engineered constructs can be prepared that contain a controlled spatial distribution of cells and growth factors, as well as engineered gradients of scaffold materials with a predicted microstructure. Here, we review the application, advancement and future directions of SFF techniques in the design and creation of scaffolds for use in clinically driven tissue engineering.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.This paper presents a demonstration of the trot-to-gallop transition and subsequent stable gallop in a robotic quadruped. The MIT Cheetah I, a planar quadruped platform for high-speed running, achieves these tasks with a speed of 3.2 m/s (Froude number of 2.1) on a treadmill. The controller benefits from clues from biological findings and it incorporates (1) a gait pattern modulation that imposes predefined gait patterns with a proprioceptive touchdown feedback, (2) tunable equilibrium-point foot-end trajectories for four limbs that intentionally modulate ground reaction forces, and (3) programmable leg compliance that provides instantaneous reflexes to leg-ground interaction. An inertial measurement unit sensor is integrated with the controller in order to regulate leg angles of attack at touchdown. We reduce the dimension of the control parameters which describe temporal/spatial characteristics of quadruped locomotion, and the values are tuned via dynamic simulation and then experiment. Given a pre-defined virtual leg compliance and a desired angle of attack of legs, the equilibrium-point foot-end trajectories and phase relationships between four legs for stable trot and gallop gaits are found independently. We propose a simple throw-and-catch gait transition strategy which connects two stable limit cycles, the trot and the gallop, by linearly varying control parameters during the transition period. Successful gait transition is achieved in both simulation and experiment. Comprehensive analysis on the characteristics of the MIT Cheetah I experimental trot-to-gallop transition is provided. The phase portraits imply that stable limit cycles are achieved with the proposed controller in both trot and gallop, which enables the trot-to-gallop gait transition at high speed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.This paper presents implementation of a highly dynamic running gait with a hierarchical controller on the MIT Cheetah. The developed controller enables high-speed running of up to 6m/s (Froude number of Fr ≈ 7.34) incorporating proprioceptive feedback and programmable virtual leg compliance of the MIT Cheetah. To achieve a stable and fast trot gait, we applied three control strategies: (a) programmable virtual leg compliance that provides instantaneous reflexes to external disturbance and facilitates the self-stabilizing shown in the passive dynamics of locomotion; (b) tunable stance-trajectory design, intended to adjust impulse at each foot-end in the stance phase in a high speed trot-running according to the equilibrium-point hypothesis; and (c) a gait-pattern modulation that imposes a desired cyclic gait-pattern taking cues from proprioceptive TD feedback. Based on three strategies, the controller is hierarchically structured. The control parameters for forward speeds, a specific gait-pattern, and desired leg trajectories are managed by a high-level controller. It consists of both a gait-pattern modulator with proprioceptive leg TD detection and a leg-trajectory generator using a B{\`{e}}zier curve and a tunable amplitude sinusoidal wave. Instead of employing physical spring/dampers in the robot's leg, the programmable virtual leg compliance is realized using proprioceptive impedance control in individual low-level leg controllers.To verify the developed controller, a robot dynamic simulator is constructed based on the model parameters of the MIT Cheetah. The controller parameters are tuned with the simulator to achieve self-stability, and then applied to the MIT Cheetah in an experimental environment. Using leg kinematics and applied motor current feedbacks, the MIT Cheetah achieved a stable trot-running gait in the sagittal plane.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a 3-D dynamic simulation of a previously developed basilisk lizard inspired quadruped robot, which is capable of locomotion on the surface of water. Using this 3-D simulation along with several 1-D and 2-D models, stability in terms of robot elevation from the water surface and robot rolling are examined. Analysis of the lifting force shows the robot is capable of running on water using viscous drag forces. Using this analysis, a criterion for convergence to a steady state distance from the water is presented. It is determined that 7-12 Hz is an appropriate running frequency range for the robot to lift its weight. Compliant footpads are found to be beneficial in reducing the force associated with pulling out of the water. Further, from the roll motion analysis, previous designs result in instability along the roll axis. By comparing leg running frequency to the bodypsilas roll frequency, the minimum required roll moment of inertia for stable roll motion can be determined.},

The model is evaluated in simulation and a physical robotic platform by analyzing the kinematics and ground reaction force. The experimental results show that, with a proper leg design of passive dynamics and elasticity, an attractor state of human-like walking gait patterns can be achieved through extremely simple control without sensory feedback.

In particular, we can expect that the robotic systems could achieve high maneuverability by flexibly storing and releasing energy through the motor control of the physical interaction between the body and the environment. This paper presents a minimalistic optimization strategy of motor control policy for underactuated legged robotic systems. Based on a reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose an optimization scheme, with which the robot can exploit passive elasticity for hopping forward while maintaining the stability of locomotion process in the environment with a series of large changes of ground surface. We show a case study of a simple one-legged robot which consists of a servomotor and a passive elastic joint. The dynamics and learning performance of the robot model are tested in simulation, and then transferred the results to the real-world robot.},

abstract = {Close physical interaction between robots and humans is a particularly challenging aspect of robot development. For successful interaction and cooperation, the robot must have the ability to adapt its behavior to the human counterpart. Based on our earlier work, we present and evaluate a computationally efficient machine learning algorithm that is well suited for such close-contact interaction scenarios. We show that this algorithm helps to improve the quality of the interaction between a robot and a human caregiver. To this end, we present two human-in-the-loop learning scenarios that are inspired by human parenting behavior, namely, an assisted standing-up task and an assisted walking task. {\textcopyright} 1994-2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {A properly designed elastic actuation can increase the jumping height that a legged robot can reach. In this paper we compare the two most popular conceptual soft actuator designs, parallel elastic (PEA) and series elastic (SEA), in the task of maximizing the jumping height. Such task is translated into an optimal control problem. For a simplified version of the problem an analytical solution is provided, while a problem with more realistic constraints (e.g. the linear torque-speed motor characteristic is taken into account) is stated as a convex optimization problem and numerically solved. The results show that: (i) given the power of the motor there exists an optimal constant stiffness that maximizes the performance for both the SEA and the PEA; (ii) the optimal stiffness depends on the task terminal time, the inertial parameters of the system and the reduction ratio of the motor; (iii) in the condition considered the SEA behaves better than the PEA.},

This paper examines whether it would theoretically be possible to use the same method to dig into dry soil. The stress state of the soil around the contracting robot was analyzed, and a target zero-stress state for dry soil digging was found. Then, the two possible modes of soil collapse were investigated and used to determine how quickly the robot would have to contract to achieve the target zero-stress state. It was found that for most dry soils, a RoboClam-like device would have to contract in 0.02 s, a speed slightly faster than the current robot is capable of, but still within the realm of possibility for a similar machine. These results suggest that the biomimetic approach successfully used by RoboClam to dig into submerged soil could feasibly be used to dig into dry soil as well.},

abstract = {The objective of articulating sustainability visions through modeling is to enhance the outcomes and process of visioning in order to successfully move the system toward a desired state. Models emphasize approaches to develop visions that are viable and resilient and are crafted to adhere to sustainability principles. This approach is largely assembled from visioning processes (resulting in descriptions of desirable future states generated from stakeholder values and preferences) and participatory modeling processes (resulting in systems-based representations of future states co-produced by experts and stakeholders). Vision modeling is distinct from normative scenarios and backcasting processes in that the structure and function of the future desirable state is explicitly articulated as a systems model. Crafting, representing and evaluating the future desirable state as a systems model in participatory settings is intended to support compliance with sustainability visioning quality criteria (visionary, sustainable, systemic, coherent, plausible, tangible, relevant, nuanced, motivational and shared) in order to develop rigorous and operationalizable visions. We provide two empirical examples to demonstrate the incorporation of vision modeling in research practice and education settings. In both settings, vision modeling was used to develop, represent, simulate and evaluate future desirable states. This allowed participants to better identify, explore and scrutinize sustainability solutions.},

abstract = {Hierarchically organized myosin and actin filaments found in biological systems exhibit contraction and expansion behaviours that produce work and force by consuming chemical energy. Inspired by these naturally occurring examples, we have developed photoresponsive wet- and dry-type molecular actuators built from rotaxane-based compounds known as [c2]daisy chains (specifically, [c2]AzoCD2 hydrogel and [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel). These actuators were prepared via polycondensation between four-armed poly(ethylene glycol) and a [c2]daisy chain based on $\alpha{\$}-cyclodextrin as the host component and azobenzene as a photoresponsive guest component. The light-induced actuation arises from the sliding motion of the [c2]daisy chain unit. Ultraviolet irradiation caused the gels to bend towards the light source. The response of the [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel, even under dry conditions, is very fast (7° every second), which is 10,800 times faster than the [c2]AzoCD2 hydrogel (7° every 3 h). In addition, the [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel was used as a crane arm to lift an object using ultraviolet irradiation to produce mechanical work.},

abstract = {Engineering career interest, especially that of young women, declines as they approach high-school graduation. We used expectancy-value theory, which emphasizes expectations for success and subjective value of experiences as antecedent factors to choice, as a framework for investigating new 9th grade soft robot design lessons. Compared to traditional robotics, the nature of soft robotics—materially embedded safety and an emerging technology with significant social implications—positions it to be favorable for growing students' perceptions of success and value. To gauge the impact of the lessons following the first year of implementation, we use multilevel and ANOVA models to predict changes in three student perceptions following the lessons: self-efficacy (related to expectations of success), and situational motivation and career interest (both related to subjective value). Survey responses and demographic information were collected from 431 students, before and after both the soft robotics treatment lessons and the traditional robotics comparison lessons. Analysis of the results indicates that changes in perception were negligible for both lesson types and genders. These comparable findings between the lesson types indicate the feasibility of incorporating soft robotics into high-school classrooms. While not noticeably better, the soft robotics lessons expose students to an emerging field of engineering situated in a socially meaningful context that is theoretically aligned with career choices. Moreover, challenges that occurred during the first-year implementation suggest possible refinements which may improve students' experiences and perceptions as our research continues.},

Emerging from collaboration between researchers in the mechanical engineering department and technology and engineering education department at Purdue University, a novel design-based curriculum for student soft robot design has been pilot-tested at high schools this year. The present version of the curriculum materials is the result of previous years of pilot tests and refinement as we adapted laboratory procedures to a design- and inquiry-based lesson appropriate for classroom use. It is currently being implemented by seven high-school teachers using the Engineering byDesign curriculum. This paper will describe the rationale for the project and psychosocial factors underpinning the theorized utility of the experience for promoting student engineering self-efficacy and motivation. Following an overview of theory behind the curriculum, we describe how these principles align with the student experience while fabricating soft robots. Finally, we offer preliminary reports on initial states and changes in student perceptions as they participated in the curriculum.},

In the limit, processes, such as three dimensional (3D) Printing can create parts with composition control on a length scale of 100 $\mu$m. To exploit this potential, new methods to model, exchange, and process parts with Local Composition Control need to be developed. An approach to modeling a part's geometry, topology, and composition is presented. This approach is based on subdividing the solid model into sub-regions and associating analytic composition blending functions with each region. These blending functions define the composition throughout the model as mixtures of the primary materials avialable to the SFF machine. Design tools based upon distance functions are also introduced, such as the specification of composition as a function of the distance from the surface of a part. Finally, the role of design rules restricting maximum and minimum concentrations is discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

In our approach,we combine precision model experiments, scaling analyses, and computer simulations toward developing predictive understanding of the coiling process. Both cases of deposition onto static and moving substrates are considered. We construct phase diagrams for the possible coiling patterns and characterize them as a function of the geometric and material properties of the rod, as well as the height and relative speeds of deployment. The modes selected and their characteristic length scales are found to arise from a complex interplay between gravitational, bending, and twisting energies of the rod, coupled to the geometric nonlinearities intrinsic to the large deformations. We give particular emphasis to the first sinusoidal mode of instability, which we find to be consistent with a Hopf bifurcation, and analyze the meandering wavelength and amplitude. Throughout, we systematically vary natural curvature of the rod as a control parameter,which has a qualitative and quantitative effect on the pattern formation, above a critical value thatwedetermine. The universality conferred by the prominent role of geometry in the deformation modes of the rod suggests using the gained understanding as design guidelines, in the original applications that motivated the study.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. Sensor fabrication for microrobots is challenging due to their small size and low mass. As a potential solution, we present a technique for estimating the velocity of piezoelectric bending bimorph actuators, a popular choice for driving such microscale devices, that requires simple electronics and no additional mechanical components. Our approach relies on the insight that motion of the actuators causes varying strains on the surface on the piezoelectric material, which via the direct piezoelectric effect, results in a current proportional to the actuator velocity. We propose that the actuator be electrically approximated as a parallel combination of a frequency and voltage dependent resistor and capacitor, and a velocity proportional current source. We develop an experimental procedure to measure these quantities, and are able to experimentally determine the actuator tip velocity to within 10% accuracy over a range of voltages (25-200 V) and frequencies (1-2000 Hz, well beyond actuator resonance). We successfully apply this sensing methodology to two microrobots, the RoboBee and the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot (HAMR), to estimate the wing and limb motion respectively. We further use sensor feedback to close the loop on HAMR's leg phase and obtain desired leg trajectories near transmission resonance. The proposed sensor methodology is generic and can be applied to piezoelectric actuators of different geometries and configurations for uses in microrobotic applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study cohesive flocking and formation flocking of multiple robotic fish swimming in the water surface under the guidance of only one leader with zero-value external input. Combining consensus algorithms and attraction/repulsion functions, a distributed flocking algorithm is proposed for the robotic fish system to execute the cohesive flocking task. According to the LaSalle-Krasovskii invariance principle, the proposed algorithm enables followers to asymptotically track the leader's velocity and approach the equilibrium distances with their neighbors, provided that the initial interaction network of the system is a leader-follower connected graph. Furthermore, by adding the information of a desired formation topology to the potential function term, the proposed algorithm can be extended to solve arbitrarily shaped formation flocking problem of multiple robotic fish. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are effective for three robotic fish. Finally, several simulation examples are given to verify the functionality of the proposed approaches for a larger system with ten agents.},

abstract = {Continuum robots that move through undulatory actuation must be composed of body materials that can enable flexible movement yet also provide resistive forces to the surrounding fluid, granular, or solid environments. This need for 'f1exible-yet-stiff' materials is notably important in robot designs that use passive propulsive elements such as tails and wings. Here we explore a laminate design paradigm for 'f1exible-yet-stiff' robotic materials through sliding layer laminates (SLLs). We present design principles motivated by theory and experiment and illustrate a taxonomy of SLL enabled morphable materials capable of up to 7 fold change in stiffness. Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of SLLs to undulatory continuum robots: a swimming robot with a passive tail. We target two desired robot locomotor behaviors: fast open water swimming, and steady swimming through narrow channels emulating underwater caverns and pipes. We demonstrate how tuning the stiffness of the robot tail maximizes thrust generation in these two locomotion modes. Soft tails are optimal in confined swimming because they generate short amplitude high wavenumber oscillations, while stiff tails in confined environments either collide with the walls or do not generate sufficient thrust. However, stiff tails are far better in unconfined environments which enable large stroke amplitudes requiring high stiffness.

abstract = {The morphology of a foldable kirigami structure with modified Miura-ori patterns, which displays curvature during motion, was investigated in this paper. The principle of spherical trigonometry was used to obtain the radius, span, rise, and longitudinal length of the foldable structure during motion. The results show that the radius of curvatures decreases and that the span initially increases and then decreases during the deployment process. Furthermore, there is little change in the span over the greater part of the deployment range. Changing the values for the length, a , and the vertex angle, $\beta$ , demonstrates that the deployment angle at the end of the motion, the span, and the maximal rise increase with the increase in the length a . However, changing these values has no effect on the longitudinal length. At the same time, the effect of the vertex angle $\beta$ on the geometry of the foldable kirigami is not significant.},

To realise fish-like swimming behaviours by a robotic system poses tremendous challenges, especially for the C-shape turning (CST).

abstract = {Remarkable similarities in the vertical plane of forward motion exist among diverse legged runners. The effect of differences in posture may be reflected instead in maneuverability occurring in the horizontal plane. The maneuver we selected was turning during rapid running by the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis, a sprawled-postured arthropod. Executing a turn successfully involves at least two requirements. The animal's mean heading (the direction of the mean velocity vector of the center of mass) must be deflected, and the animal's body must rotate to keep the body axis aligned with the heading. We used two-dimensional kinematics to estimate net forces and rotational torques, and a photoelastic technique to estimate single-leg ground-reaction forces during turning. Stride frequencies and duty factors did not differ among legs during turning. The inside legs ended their steps closer to the body than during straight-ahead running, suggesting that they contributed to turning the body. However, the inside legs did not contribute forces or torques to turning the body, but actively pushed against the turn. Legs farther from the center of rotation on the outside of the turn contributed the majority of force and torque impulse which caused the body to turn. The dynamics of turning could not be predicted from kinematic measurements alone. To interpret the single-leg forces observed during turning, we have developed a general model that relates leg force production and leg position to turning performance. The model predicts that all legs could turn the body. Front legs can contribute most effectively to turning by producing forces nearly perpendicular to the heading, whereas middle and hind legs must produce additional force parallel to the heading. The force production necessary to turn required only minor alterations in the force hexapods generate during dynamically stable, straight-ahead locomotion. A consideration of maneuverability in the horizontal plane revealed that a sprawled-postured, hexapodal body design may provide exceptional performance with simplified control.},

The prototype did not facilitate discussions on the overarching concept of the design, to the same extent as the sketches did, but it did facilitate operational issues. The sketches gave the broadest discussion. The groups also approached the design differently; for example, the system developers constantly returned to a constructional perspective.

@article{Johnston1991,
abstract = {This essay explores how the properties of striated muscles are matched to the tasks they perform during running, swimming and flying. During exercise the major locomotory muscles undergo alternate cycles of lengthening and shortening. Force development is greatly influenced by the timing of stimulation in relation to the length-change cycle and by the nature of elastic structures connecting the muscle fibres to the skeleton. The storage and recovery of elastic strain energy by the tendons (apodema in insects) results in a considerable saving of metabolic energy. Strain is independent of locomotory frequency, body size and muscle temperature. In contrast, the frequency of cycles, and hence strain rate, generally increases with speed and is inversely proportional to body size. The maximum isometric stress (P0) striated muscles can exert is rather similar. During steady running or hopping in mammals the peak muscle stress is around one-third of P0. Behaviours such as vertical jumping impose higher stresses requiring disproportionately larger muscles and tendons, which may limit the storage of elastic strain energy. Muscles of small animals consume significantly more energy per gram than do those of large ones. This may be because they need to activate and deactivate their muscles at a higher rate to move at an equivalent speed. When differences in force production are normalised, by multiplying the energy consumed per stride by stride frequency, similar values for the mass-specific cost of locomotion are found in animals with different leg architectures, numbers of legs, skeletal type, body sizes and muscle temperatures.},

The robot employs a novel jumping module with enhanced energy storing-capacity and a height-adjustable active trigger. To increase the energy-storing capacity, latex rubber and knee-like joints are employed to utilize large displacement of the elastic material. The active trigger is based on a single DC motor and can release stored energy at any state, enabling the robot to control the take-off speed of jumping. The jumping module is integrated with the lightweight Dash crawler. The integrated jumping-crawling robot weighs 59.4 g and controls its moving trajectory by adjusting both its crawling speed and its jumping take-off speed.},

abstract = {Numerous animals live in, and locomote through, subsea soils. To move in a medium dominated by frictional interactions, many of these animals have adopted unique burrowing strategies. This paper presents a burrowing model inspired by the Atlantic razor clam (Ensis directus), which uses deformations of its body to cyclically loosen and re-pack the surrounding soil in order to locally manipulate burrowing drag. The model reveals how an anisotropic body composed of a cylinder and sphere varying sinusoidally in size and relative displacement achieves unidirectional motion through a medium with variable frictional properties. This net displacement is attained even though the body kinematics are reciprocal and inertia of both the model organism and the surrounding medium are negligible. Our results indicate that body aspect ratio has a strong effect on burrowing velocity and efficiency, with a well-defined maximum for given kinematics and soil material properties. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Unlike the falling cat, lizards can right themselves in mid-air by a swing of their large tails in one direction causing the body to rotate in the other. Here, we developed a new three-dimensional analytical model to investigate the effectiveness of tails as inertial appendages that change body orientation. We anchored our model using the morphological parameters of the flat-tailed house gecko Hemidactylus platyurus. The degree of roll in air righting and the amount of yaw in mid-air turning directly measured in house geckos matched the model's results. Our model predicted an increase in body roll and turning as tails increase in length relative to the body. Tails that swung from a near orthogonal plane relative to the body (i.e. 0-30° from vertical) were the most effective at generating body roll, whereas tails operating at steeper angles (i.e. 45-60°) produced only half the rotation. To further test our analytical model's predictions, we built a bio-inspired robot prototype. The robot reinforced how effective attitude control can be attained with simple movements of an inertial appendage.},

abstract = {Geckos are nature's elite climbers. Their remarkable climbing feats have been attributed to specialized feet with hairy toes that uncurl and peel in milliseconds. Here, we report that the secret to the gecko's arboreal acrobatics includes an active tail. We examine the tail's role during rapid climbing, aerial descent, and gliding. We show that a gecko's tail functions as an emergency fifth leg to prevent falling during rapid climbing. A response initiated by slipping causes the tail tip to push against the vertical surface, thereby preventing pitch-back of the head and upper body. When pitch-back cannot be prevented, geckos avoid falling by placing their tail in a posture similar to a bicycle's kickstand. Should a gecko fall with its back to the ground, a swing of its tail induces the most rapid, zero-angular momentum air-righting response yet measured. Once righted to a sprawled gliding posture, circular tail movements control yaw and pitch as the gecko descends. Our results suggest that large, active tails can function as effective control appendages. These results have provided biological inspiration for the design of an active tail on a climbing robot, and we anticipate their use in small, unmanned gliding vehicles and multisegment spacecraft.},

Also, for robots to interact with unknown objects, flexibility is necessary. Backdrivability is effective when both flexibility and high output torque needs to be realized, which were often contradicting requirement. In this paper, backdrivable hydrostatic transmission is proposed to satisfy requirements above. First, development of hydrostatic actuator including conditions of backdrivability is explained. Second design of backdrivable pump, hydraulic motor and manifold design is explained. Next, design of an anthropomorphic robot hand using developed hydrostatic transmission is discussed. Finally, developed hand is presented and experiments on backdrivability, force sensing, and grasping were performed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018. In the multimachine circumstances, it is difficult to analyze the steady state stability of each generator. In previous research, analysis of the steady state stability limit has been carried out but only look at the stability of the overall system. Therefore, to analyze the stability of each generator, the multimachine system must be changed into a Single Machine to Infinite Bus (SMIB) system by collecting all the loads into one central load in the infinite bus. The method to change from the multimachine system to SMIB system is presented in this paper. The multimachine system is converted into an equivalent impedance (req and xeq) and an equivalent load based on losses concept. After req and xeq is calculated, then by using steady state stability limit concept, the value of the maximum generation of each generator units can be determined. By means of maximum generation is the maximum output power limit that can be generated without causing unstability. ETAP simulation is used to validate the calculation results of the proposed method. The method was applied to units generator in Java Bali system 500 kV.},

abstract = {We report a comprehensive scaling law and novel lift generation mechanisms relevant to the aerodynamic functions of structural flexibility in insect flight. Using a Navier-Stokes equation solver, fully coupled to a structural dynamics solver, we consider the hovering motion of a wing of insect size, in which the dynamics of fluid-structure interaction leads to passive wing rotation. Lift generated on the flexible wing scales with the relative shape deformation parameter, whereas the optimal lift is obtained when the wing deformation synchronizes with the imposed translation, consistent with previously reported observations for fruit flies and honeybees. Systematic comparisons with rigid wings illustrate that the nonlinear response in wing motion results in a greater peak angle compared with a simple harmonic motion, yielding higher lift. Moreover, the compliant wing streamlines its shape via camber deformation to mitigate the nonlinear lift-degrading wing-wake interaction to further enhance lift. These bioinspired aeroelastic mechanisms can be used in the development of flapping wing micro-robots.},

abstract = {The modeling of fluid interactions around airfoils is difficult given the complicated, often non-symmetric geometries involved. The complex variable technique of conformal mapping is a useful intermediate step that allows for complicated airfoil flow problems to be solved as problems with simpler geometry. In this paper, we use the conformal mapping technique to model the fluid flow around the NACA 0012, 2215, and 4412 airfoils by using the Joukowsky transformation to link the flow solution for a cylinder to that of an airfoil. The flow around a cylinder was derived with the superposition of ele-mentary potential flows using an inviscid, incompressible fluid model. Lift calculations as a function of angle of attack for each airfoil were obtained using the transformed flow solutions and fundamental theories of aerodynamics. These calculations are compared against lift calculations provided by the thin airfoil method. Lift calculations for the NACA 0012 airfoil match well with expected results, while there is a discrepancy at low angles of attack for the 2215 and 4412 airfoils.},

METHOD: A cylindrical object is held with a power grasp and the contact forces are measured at 20 defined positions. The distributions of contact forces in standard electric prostheses, in a experimental prosthesis with an adaptive grasp, and in human hands as a reference are analysed and compared. Additionally, the joint torques are calculated and compared. RESULTS: Contact forces of up to 24.7 N are applied by the middle and distal phalanges of the index finger, middle finger, and thumb of standard prosthetic hands, whereas forces of up to 3.8 N are measured for human hands. The maximum contact forces measured in a prosthetic hand with an adaptive grasp are 4.7 N. The joint torques of human hands and the adaptive prosthesis are comparable. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of grip force distribution is proposed as an additional parameter to rate the performance of different prosthetic hand designs.},

abstract = {— This paper presents a novel manufacturing paradigm for constructing origami-inspired pop-up robots for future space exploration missions. The new approach uses a textile-enhanced rigid-flex printed circuit board (PCB) to implement a folding robot chassis using robust, spaceflight-tolerant materials, and integrates the robot electronics directly into the chassis for added compactness. The new approach also decouples the mechanical and electrical functions of the chassis flexures for improved kinematics and lifetime. This manufactur-ing paradigm was used to build PUFFER (Pop-Up Flat Folding Explorer Robot), a self-actuated pop-up rover being developed to provide a low-payload-cost mobility enhancement for future NASA missions.},

abstract = {Using simple running models, researchers have argued that swing-leg retraction can improve running robot performance. In this paper, we investigate whether this holds for a more realistic simulation model validated against a physical running robot. We find that swing-leg retraction can improve stability and disturbance rejection. Alternatively, swing-leg retraction can simultaneously reduce touchdown forces, slipping likelihood, and impact energy losses. Surprisingly, swing-leg retraction barely affected net energetic efficiency. The retraction rates at which these effects are the greatest are strongly model-dependent, suggesting that robot designers cannot always rely on simplified models to accurately predict such complex behaviors.},

Team RoboSimian achieved a 5th place finish by achieving 7 points in 47:59 min. We present an architecture that was structured to be adaptable at the lowest level and repeatable at the highest level. The low-level adaptability was achieved by leveraging tactile measurements from force torque sensors in the wrist coupled with whole-body motion primitives. We use the term “behaviors” to conceptualize this low-level adaptability. Each behavior is a contact-triggered state machine that enables execution of short-order manipulation and mobility tasks autonomously. At a high level, we focused on a teach-and-repeat style of development by storing executed behaviors and navigation poses in an object/task frame for recall later. This enabled us to perform tasks with high repeatability on competition day while being robust to task differences from practice to execution.},

abstract = {When an object is made using Laminated Manufacturing (LM), the output is a rectangular block with the required object trapped inside. In order to enable extraction of the object, the remaining sheet in each layer is cut into square grids that grow into tiny tiles. Thus, the remaining stock inside and surrounding the object is in the form of tiled fragments. The operator 'decubes' or removes these tiles using sharp tools and extracts the object. Making use of the remaining stock as support structure and grid cutting to enable extraction of the object are very innovative ideas in the 'paste-and-cut' LM approach. However, this method is very inefficient for two reasons: firstly, cutting efficiency is poor since laser spends most of its time in grid cutting; secondly, decubing takes several hours. In this paper, an efficient method of cutting the remaining stock to extract the object is presented. Extraction of the object from the stock block has analogy with the extraction of casting from its mold - the present and proposed methods respectively being analogous to sand casting and permanent mold casting processes. In the proposed method, rather than fragmenting the remaining stock into tiny tiles, it is segmented into two stock halves that open about a parting surface of minimum area. This optimal parting surface is obtained for the convex hull of the object, rather than for the object itself, due to its complete visibility along any pair opposite directions. The convex hull is further segmented into the object and plugs. The plugs are so shaped that they do not get entangled inside the concave portions of the object. The plugs whose drawing directions coincide with the opening direction of the stock halves are merged with the corresponding stock halves. The object, all the plugs and both the stock halves form the stock block. All these pieces are made together in the LM machine. For disassembly, first the convex hull will be extracted by opening the stock halves. Subsequently the plugs that fill the concave portions of the object will be extracted from the convex hull. Thus, grid cutting and decubing are eliminated in the proposed method resulting in drastic reduction in prototyping time and improved quality of the prototype. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {While CNC machining (subtractive method) is the only option when it comes to high quality components, it demands greater human intervention to generate the CNC programs, making it a slow and costly route. On the other hand, Rapid Prototyping (additive method) is able to convert the design into the physical objects without any human intervention. But its total automation comes with compromises in the qualities of geometry and material. A hybrid layered manufacturing process presented here combines the best features of both these approaches. In this process the near-net shape of the object is first built using weld-deposition; the near-net shape is then finish machined subsequently. Time and cost saving of this process can be attributed to reduction in NC programming effort and elimination of rough machining. It is envisioned as a low cost retro-fitment to any existing CNC machine for making metallic objects without disturbing its original functionalities. Near-net shape building and finish machining happening at the same station is the unique feature of this process. A customized software generates the NC program for near-net shape building. The intricate details of integrating arc welding unit with a CNC milling machine are presented in this paper. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The field of health education provides a vehicle for research; however, it is not the paper's central foci. Of key concern is the development of a critical disposition in students--a disposition geared toward teaching for social equity. Learning of this nature transcends topic domains, and therefore allows for collaboration between academics in different parts of teacher education. Specifically, the paper focuses upon "whiteness" and applies a whiteness lens (a form of critical discourse analysis) to portions of the research data to explore how discourses of race circumscribe the efforts of white students and teachers, often resulting in unintentional "brushes" with whiteness (or reproductions of white race privilege). A collaborative approach that develops racial literacy through direct engagement with racial representations is considered as a way forward.},

abstract = {Closeup exploration of underwater life requires new forms of interaction, using biomimetic creatures that are capable of agile swimming maneuvers, equipped with cameras, and supported by remote human operation. Current robotic prototypes do not provide adequate platforms for studying marine life in their natural habitats. This work presents the design, fabrication, control, and oceanic testing of a soft robotic fish that can swim in three dimensions to continuously record the aquatic life it is following or engaging. Using a miniaturized acoustic communication module, a diver can direct the fish by sending commands such as speed, turning angle, and dynamic vertical diving. This work builds on previous generations of robotic fish that were restricted to one plane in shallow water and lacked remote control. Experimental results gathered from tests along coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean show that the robotic fish can successfully navigate around aquatic life at depths ranging from 0 to 18 meters. Furthermore, our robotic fish exhibits a lifelike undulating tail motion enabled by a soft robotic actuator design that can potentially facilitate a more natural integration into the ocean environment. We believe that our study advances beyond what is currently achievable using traditional thruster-based and tethered autonomous underwater vehicles, demonstrating methods that can be used in the future for studying the interactions of aquatic life and ocean dynamics.},

Prior to developing voxel-based FGM designs using compatible dithering approaches, it is essential to first understand the basic principles of voxelbased digital composite designs. While several research studies exist regarding different representations of composition in voxel-based solid models, there is no extensive research on the material properties of voxel-based digital composite structures. This paper bridges this gap by investigating custom voxel-based designs of digital composite structures. The objective is to determine how the material properties of such structures are impacted by different voxel sizes using the material jetting process. In addition to the material properties, computational time taken to process different voxel sizes is analyzed. By doing so, we gain a better understanding of the relationship between material composition and voxel size in digital composite structures.},

abstract = {This paper reports a study of 66 upper limb amputees in County Funen, Denmark who were visited in their homes by the author. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the consumer concerns about their prostheses and to see if these were related to cessation of prosthetic use. It was also intended to estimate functional levels of both prosthetic users and non-users. The number of amputees investigated corresponds to the annual number of persons becoming upper limb amputees in Denmark. There were 3 prosthetic systems in use, two active systems and one passive system. At review there was a group of 18 amputees which did not use a prosthesis at all. It appeared that active and partially active users are younger persons with a relatively short time-lapse since amputation. Passive users are older persons with a long time-lapse since amputation. Only 4 out of 18 prosthetic non-users stopped prosthetic use as a consequence of prosthetic problems or discomfort. Active prostheses had the highest number of consumer problems. Most problems were concerned with the socket, and for the body powered prostheses also with the suspension and control system. It was shown that an awareness of the amputee's working conditions is important at the fitting stage, especially the daily working situation. As a consequence strictly individual fitting is needed with attention being given to the manner in which the individual will use the prosthesis. This investigation clearly shows that active fitting is a worthy effort. In daily living the active users have a superior performance over the passive and non-users. It was observed that amputees despite many years of training still have problems with activities of daily living, particularly in relation to independent functions.},

The overhand pseudoknot was designed to be noncommutative so that forward folding along the chain results in the correct structure whereas reverse folding does not. The manipulation of nitinol wire structures leads to simple empirical rules for folding for noncommutative pseudoknots.

abstract = {This paper examines the design of a parallel spring-loaded actuated linkage intended for dynamically dexterous legged robotics applications. Targeted at toe placement in the sagittal plane, the mechanism applies two direct-drive brushless dc motors to a symmetric five bar linkage arranged to power free tangential motion and compliant radial motion associated with running, leaping, and related agile locomotion behaviors. Whereas traditional leg design typically decouples the consideration of motor sizing, kinematics and compliance, we examine their conjoined influence on three key characteristics of the legged locomotion cycle: transducing battery energy to body energy during stance; mitigating collision losses upon toe touchdown; and storing and harvesting prior body energy in the spring during stance. This analysis leads to an unconventional design whose “knee” joint rides above the “hip” joint. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting mechanism can deliver more than half again as much kinetic energy to the body (or more than double the kinetic energy if the full workspace is used), and offers a five-fold increase in energy storage and collision efficiency relative to the conventional design.},

We present theory and experiment to show that the instability can be harnessed to achieve giant voltage-triggered deformation. We mount a membrane on a chamber of a suitable volume, pressurize the membrane into a state near the verge of the instability, and apply voltage to trigger the snap without causing electrical breakdown. For an acrylic membrane we demonstrate voltagetriggered expansion of area by 1692%, far beyond the largest value reported in the literature. The large expansion can even be retained after the voltage is switched off.},

abstract = {Mammals use the elastic components in their legs (principally tendons, ligaments, and muscles) to run economically, while maintaining consistent support mechanics across various surfaces. To examine how leg stiffness and metabolic cost are affected by changes in substrate stiffness, we built experimental platforms with adjustable stiffness to fit on a force-plate-fitted treadmill. Eight male subjects [mean body mass: 74.4 +/- 7.1 (SD) kg; leg length: 0.96 +/- 0.05 m] ran at 3.7 m/s over five different surface stiffnesses (75.4, 97.5, 216.8, 454.2, and 945.7 kN/m). Metabolic, ground-reaction force, and kinematic data were collected. The 12.5-fold decrease in surface stiffness resulted in a 12% decrease in the runner's metabolic rate and a 29% increase in their leg stiffness. The runner's support mechanics remained essentially unchanged. These results indicate that surface stiffness affects running economy without affecting running support mechanics. We postulate that an increased energy rebound from the compliant surfaces studied contributes to the enhanced running economy.},

abstract = {Doubt has existed as to whether the tube feet of a starfish in locomotion act as a system of levers or whether they form a traction system, attaching to the substratum and contracting so as to pull the animal along. This problem has been investigated by recording the forces exerted by a single tube foot. The recording apparatus is described. It is shown that both lever and traction methods can be used according to circumstances. When the starfish is walking on a horizontal surface it is shown that the tube feet certainly act as struts and that they probably also act as levers. When the starfish is climbing upon a vertical surface (or meeting with resistance upon a horizontal surface) the tube feet attach themselves to the substratum and form a traction system.},

Analogous to masonry in construction sites, micro-masonry consists of the preparation, manipulation, and binding of microscale units to assemble microcomponents and microsystems. In this paper, for the purpose of demonstration, we used microtipped elastomeric stamps as manipulators and built three dimensional silicon microstructures. Silicon units of varied shapes were fabricated in a suspended format on donors, retrieved, delivered, and placed on a target location on a receiver using microtipped stamps. Annealing of the assembled silicon units permanently bound them and completed the micro-masonry procedure.},

abstract = {Laminate mechanisms are a reliable concept in producing lowcost robots for educational and commercial purposes. These mechanisms are produced using low-cost manufacturing techniques which have improved significantly during recent years and are more accessible to novices and hobbyists. However, iterating through the design space to come up with the best design for a robot is still a time consuming and rather expensive task and therefore, there is still a need for model-based analysis before manufacturing. Until now, there has been no integrated design and analysis software for laminate robots. This paper addresses some of the issues surrounding laminate analysis by introducing a companion to an existing laminate design tool that automates the generation of dynamic equations and produces simulation results via rendered plots and videos. We have validated the accuracy of the software by comparing the position, velocity and acceleration of the simulated mechanisms with the measurements taken from physical laminate prototypes using a motion capture system.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Many highly dynamic novel mobile robots have been developed being inspired by animals. In this study, we are inspired by a basilisk lizard's ability to run and steer on water surface for a hexapedal robot. The robot has an active tail with a circular plate, which the robot rotates to steer on water. We dynamically modeled the platform and conducted simulations and experiments on steering locomotion with a bang-bang controller. The robot can steer on water by rotating the tail, and the controlled steering locomotion is stable. The dynamic modelling approximates the robot's steering locomotion and the trends of the simulations and experiments are similar, although there are errors between the desired and actual angles. The robot's maneuverability on water can be improved through further research.},

abstract = {Electroactive actuators have received enormous interest for a variety of biomimetic technologies ranging from robotics and microsensors to artificial muscles. Major challenges towards practically viable actuators are the achievement of large electromechanical deformation, fast switching response, low operating voltage and durable operation. Here we report a new electroactive actuator composed of self-assembled sulphonated block copolymers and ionic liquids. The new actuator demonstrated improvements in actuation properties over other polymer actuators reported earlier, large generated strain (up to 4%) without any signs of back relaxation. In particular, the millimetre-scale displacements obtained for the actuators, with rapid response (<1 s) at sub-1-V conditions over 13,500 cycles in air, have not been previously reported in the literature. The key to success stems from the evolution of the unique hexagonal structure of the polymer layer with domain size gradients beneath the cathode during actuation, which promotes the bending motion of the actuators.},

Animals exploit soft structures to move effectively in complex natural environments. These capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. The goal is to endow robots with new, bioinspired capabilities that permit adaptive, flexible interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review emerging soft-bodied robotic systems, and in particular recent developments inspired by soft-bodied animals. Incorporating soft technologies can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity involved in robot design. Incorporating soft technologies will also expedite the evolution of robots that can safely interact with humans and natural environments. Finally, soft robotics technology can be combined with tissue engineering to create hybrid systems for medical applications. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Small-port incisions may require both high flexibility of the manipulator for safety purposes, as well as high structural stiffness for operational precision and high payload capability. This paper presents a new hyperredundant tubular manipulator with a variable neutral-line mechanisms and adjustable stiffness. A unique asymmetric arrangement of the tendons and the links realizes both articulation of the manipulator and continuous stiffness modulation. This asymmetric motion of the manipulator is compensated by a novel actuation mechanism without affecting its structural stiffness.

abstract = {A small mobile robot that uses round wheels has a stable ride ability on flat surfaces, but the robot cannot climb an obstacle whose height is greater than the length of its wheel radius. As an alternative, legged-wheel robots have been proposed for their better climbing performance. However, such legged-wheel robots have a poor driving performance on flat surfaces since their center of mass is vertically changed. Transformable wheels are used to make the robot drive with round wheels on flat surfaces and climb an obstacle with legged-wheels. However, the design of previously developed transformable wheels is complicated because it needs actuators for the transformation. Thus, it is not suitable for small robots. In this paper, a simple robot platform called Wheel Transformer that uses a new kind of transformable wheel is described. The transformation process is passively operated by an external frictional force, so it does not need any actuators. We fabricate the transformable wheel as well as the robot platform based on analysis of transformation mechanism. The robot can climb an obstacle whose height is 2.6 times greater than its wheel radius.},

abstract = {Orientation by an animal inhabiting an underground environment must be extremely efficient if it is to contend effectively with the high energetic costs of excavating soil for a tunnel system. We examined, in the field, the ability of a fossorial rodent, the blind mole-rat, Spalax ehrenbergi, to detour different types of obstacles blocking its tunnel and rejoin the disconnected tunnel section. To create obstacles, we dug ditches, which we either left open or filled with stone or wood. Most (77%) mole-rats reconnected the two parts of their tunnel and accurately returned to their orginal path by digging a parallel bypass tunnel around the obstacle at a distance of 10-20 cm from the open ditch boundaries or 3-8 cm from the filled ditch boundaries. When the ditch was placed asymmetrically across the tunnel, the mole-rats detoured around the shorter side. These findings demonstrate that mole-rats seem to be able to assess the nature of an obstacle ahead and their own distance from the obstacle boundaries, as well as the relative location of the far section of disconnected tunnel. We suggest that mole-rats mainly use reverberating self-produced seismic vibrations as a mechanism to determine the size, nature and location of the obstacle, as well as internal self-generated references to determine their location relative to the disconnected tunnel section. {\textcopyright} 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Smooth wrinkles and sharply crumpled regions are familiar motifs in biological or synthetic sheets, such as rapidly growing plant leaves and crushed foils. Previous studies have addressed both morphological types, but the generic route whereby a featureless sheet develops a complex shape remains elusive. Here we show that this route proceeds through an unusual sequence of distinct symmetry-breaking instabilities. The object of our study is an ultrathin circular sheet stretched over a liquid drop. As the curvature is gradually increased, the surface tension stretching the sheet over the drop causes compression along circles of latitude. The compression is relieved first by a transition into a wrinkle pattern, and then into a crumpled state via a continuous transition. Our data provide conclusive evidence that wrinkle patterns in highly bendable sheets are not described by classical buckling methods, but rather by a theory which assumes that wrinkles completely relax the compressive stress. With this understanding we recognize the observed sequence of transitions as distinct symmetry breakings of the shape and the stress field. The axial symmetry of the shape is broken upon wrinkling but the underlying stress field preserves this symmetry. Thus, the wrinkle-to-crumple transition marks symmetry-breaking of the stress in highly bendable sheets. By contrast, other instabilities of sheets, such as blistering and cracking, break the homogeneity of shape and stress simultaneously. The onset of crumpling occurs when the wrinkle pattern grows to half the sheet's radius, suggesting a geometric, material-independent origin for this transition.},

Micro-task markets, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, offer a potential paradigm for engaging a large number of users for low time and monetary costs. Here we investigate the utility of a micro-task market for collecting user input and measurements, and discuss design considerations for developing remote micro user evaluation tasks. Although micro-task markets have great potential for rapidly collecting user measurements at low costs, we found that special care is needed in formulating tasks in order to harness the capabilities of the approach.},

abstract = {1. When a crayfish walks forward, its legs are not loaded equally. The third pair is the one exerting the largest vertically directed force, and the fourth legs produce the major part of the propulsive force. 2. Chronic recordings from a CSD2 nerve were made in crayfish walking on a treadmill. The activity of CSD2 rises during the stance phase. The activity peak at the beginning of the power stroke is especially pronounced in leg 4, which was studied in detail. The average spike frequency of CSD2 recordings during the first part of the power stroke is positively correlated with the initial increase in force produced by the leg. This suggests that CSD2 responds especially well to rapid load changes. 3. When a wire was fixed around a fourth leg such that it depressed the patch of compliant cuticle associated with CSD2, the activity of the sense organ was elevated throughout the entire step cycle, and the time between leg 4 touching the ground and leg 3 lifting off was more variable than in normal walking. Thus, CSD2 seems to be involved in the coordination of the walking legs. 4. Depressing the compliant cuticle of CSD2 elicits reflexes in the flexor muscle and the anterior levator in tethered crayfish. Interleg reflexes were not found.},

abstract = {Our two experiments investigated associations between cognitive representations of objects and hand-shape categories. Hand configurations were partitioned according to prehensility and the size of the contacting surface, resulting in the classes: pinch, poke, palm, and clench. Experiment 1 elicited object names in response to configuration-name cues, provided ratings of the relevance of each configuration to a set of objects, and probed for the functions determining such relevance. Cueing with a configuration class elicited an associated object category with substantial intersubject agreement, and vice versa. Both the object categories and the functions associated with the four hand-configuration classes differed substantially, although the same object could be associated to some extent with multiple configurations, given variations in function. Experiment 2 elicited the names of hand-configuration classes in response to unfamiliar forms, which varied systematically in depth and the size of the projecting picture-plane surface. The modal response, response time, and degree of intersubject agreement were directly related to these variables. These structural variables, however, did not adequately predict shaping responses to real objects, as ascertained from Experiment 1. The results have implications for cognitive representation of motor categories and hand shaping in response to objects.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Controlling the robot with a permanently-updated optimal trajectory, also known as model predictive control, is the Holy Grail of whole-body motion generation. Before obtaining it, several challenges should be faced: computation cost, non-linear local minima, algorithm stability, etc. In this paper, we address the problem of applying the updated optimal control in real-time on the physical robot. In particular, we focus on the problems raised by the delays due to computation and by the differences between the real robot and the simulated model. Based on the optimal-control solver MuJoCo, we implemented a complete model-predictive controller and we applied it in real-time on the physical HRP-2 robot. It is the first time that such a whole-body model predictive controller is applied in real-time on a complex dynamic robot. Aside from the technical contributions cited above, the main contribution of this paper is to report the experimental results of this premi{\`{e}}re implementation.},

abstract = {For maximum maneuverability, terrestrial robots need to be able to turn precisely, quickly, and with a small radius. Previous efforts at turning in legged robots primarily have used leg force or velocity modulation. We developed a palm-sized legged robot, called TAYLRoACH. The tailed robot was able to make rapid, precise turns using only the actuation of a tail appendage. By rapidly rotating the tail as the robot runs forward, the robot was able to make sudden 90° turns at 360 °s-1. Unlike other robots, this is done with almost no change in its running speed. We have also modeled the dynamics of this maneuver, to examine how features, such as tail length and mass, affect the robot's turning ability. This approach has produced turns with a radius of 0.4 body lengths at 3.2 body lengths per second running speed. Using gyro feedback and bang-bang control, we achieve an accuracy of ± 5° for a 60° turn.},

Dynamic running robots have used a variety of steering means, including differential velocity drive [1][2] and actively changing leg kinematics [3][4]. Previous robots have also used tails for various functions, such as turning in an aquatic environment [5], active pitch control [6][7], or stabilization during climbing [8]. The robot discussed here uses a tail to produce a turn on rough or flat ground. This paper examines the way in which this is done, through the use of angular momentum exchange and internal impacts that generate a turning impulse.},

The setup consists of a tank filled with sand and water, plastic models of bivalve shells capable of expelling water and an external actuation mechanism simulating the rocking burrowing motion typically used by these animals. The realistic shell shapes have been realized using three-dimensional plotting techniques allowing testing influences of different shell shapes and surface structures (sculptures) on the burrowing efficiency. Based on the experimental setup, the burrowing process has been reproduced. The results show that this setup can be used to identify correlations in the burrowing process. Further experimental work will investigate the influence of factors such as shell shape and sculpture or the motion sequence on the burrowing performance.},

@article{Kondo2007,
abstract = {Evolutionary Robotics (ER) is one of promising approaches to design robot controllers which essentially have complicated and/or complex properties. In most ER research, the sensory - motor mappings of robots are represented as artificial neural networks, and their connection weights ( and sometimes the structure of the networks) can be optimized in the parameter spaces by using evolutionary computation. However, generally, the evolved neural controllers could be fragile in unexperienced environments, especially in real worlds, because the evolutionary optimization processes would be executed in idealized simulators. This is known as the gap problem between the simulated and real worlds. To overcome this, the author focused on evolving an on-line learning ability instead of weight parameters in a simulated environment. According to recent biological findings, actually, the kinds of on-line adaptation abilities can be found in real nervous systems of insects and crustaceans, and it is also known that a variety of neuromodulators (NMs) play crucial roles to regulate the network characteristics (i.e. activating/ blocking/changing of synaptic connections). Based on this, a neuromodulatory neural network model was proposed and it was utilized as a mobile robot controller. In the paper, the detail behavior analysis of the evolved neuromodulatory neural network is also discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an open-source design for the development of low-complexity, anthropomorphic, underactuated robot hands with a selectively lockable differential mechanism. The differential mechanism used is a variation of the whiffletree (or seesaw) mechanism, which introduces a set of locking buttons that can block the motion of each finger. The proposed design is unique since with a single motor and the proposed differential mechanism the user is able to control each finger independently and switch between different grasping postures in an intuitive manner. Anthropomorphism of robot structure and motion is achieved by employing in the design process an index of anthropomorphism. The proposed robot hands can be easily fabricated using low-cost, off-the-shelf materials and rapid prototyping techniques. The efficacy of the proposed design is validated through different experimental paradigms involving grasping of everyday life objects and execution of daily life activities. The proposed hands can be used as affordable prostheses, helping amputees regain their lost dexterity.},

abstract = {Multicopters stand to revolutionize parcel delivery because of their capability to operate in areas with unsuitable road infrastructure and precisely maneuver in cluttered environments. However, current multicopters for delivery can be dangerous for people, and are difficult to store and transport. Safety issues arise because users are exposed to unshielded spinning propellers. Transportation to the place of deployment and storage is often impaired by the large size that is required for heavy lifting. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing the integration of a quadcopter into a foldable protective cage. The cage provides an all-round protective structure that physically separates the propellers from the environment, ensuring the safety of people. The drone and the cage can be easily folded with a single movement, significantly reducing its size for ease of storage and transportation. This design has been validated with a quadcopter that can lift parcels up to 500 g and reduce its storage volume by 92% when folded.},

abstract = {Many new robotic and teleoperated applications require a high degree of mobility or dexterity that is difficult to achieve with current actuator technology. Natural muscle is an actuator that has many features, including high energy density, fast speed of response, and large stroke, that are desirable for such applications. The electrostriction of polymer dielectrics with compliant electrodes can be used in electrically controllable, muscle-like actuators. These electrostrictive polymer artificial muscle (EPAM) actuators can produce strains of up to 30% and pressures of up to 1.9 MPa. The measured specific energy achieved with polyurethane and silicone polymers exceeds that of electromagnetic, electrostatic, piezoelectric, and magnetostrictive actuators. A simple model using linear elastic theory can predict EPAM actuator performance from mechanical and electrical material properties and load conditions. A spherical joint for a highly articulated (snake-like) manipulator using EPAM actuator elements has been demonstrated. A rotary motor using EPAM actuator elements has been shown to produce a specific torque of 19 mNm/g and a specific power of 0.1 W/g. An improved EPAM motor could produce greater specific power and specific torque than could electric motors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The energy that animals devote to locomotion has been of intense interest to biologists for decades and two basic methodologies have emerged to predict locomotor energy expenditure: those based on metabolic and those based on mechanical energy. Metabolic energy approaches share the perspective that prediction of locomotor energy expenditure should be based on statistically significant proxies of metabolic function, while mechanical energy approaches, which derive from many different perspectives, focus on quantifying the energy of movement. Some controversy exists as to which mechanical perspective is "best", but from first principles all mechanical methods should be equivalent if the inputs to the simulation are of similar quality. Our goals in this paper are 1) to establish the degree to which the various methods of calculating mechanical energy are correlated, and 2) to investigate to what degree the prediction methods explain the variation in energy expenditure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We use modern humans as the model organism in this experiment because their data are readily attainable, but the methodology is appropriate for use in other species. Volumetric oxygen consumption and kinematic and kinetic data were collected on 8 adults while walking at their self-selected slow, normal and fast velocities. Using hierarchical statistical modeling via ordinary least squares and maximum likelihood techniques, the predictive ability of several metabolic and mechanical approaches were assessed. We found that all approaches are correlated and that the mechanical approaches explain similar amounts of the variation in metabolic energy expenditure. Most methods predict the variation within an individual well, but are poor at accounting for variation between individuals. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the choice of predictive method is dependent on the question(s) of interest and the data available for use as inputs. Although we used modern humans as our model organism, these results can be extended to other species.},

abstract = {To explore the role of the mechanical system in control, we designed a two-dimensional, feed-forward, dynamic model of a hexapedal runner (death-head cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis). We chose to model many-legged, sprawled posture animals because of their remarkable stability. Since sprawled posture animals operate more in the horizontal plane than animals with upright postures, we decoupled the vertical and horizontal plane and only modelled the horizontal plane. The model was feed-forward with no equivalent of neural feedback among any of the components. The model was stable and its forward, lateral and rotational velocities were similar to that measured in the animal at its preferred velocity. It also self-stabilized to velocity perturbations. The rate of recovery depended on the type of perturbation. Recovery from rotational velocity perturbations occurred within one step, whereas recovery from lateral perturbations took multiple strides. Recovery from fore-aft velocity perturbations was the slowest. Perturbations were dynamically coupled - alterations in one velocity component necessarily perturbed the others. Perturbations altered the translation and/or rotation of the body which consequently provided 'mechanical feedback' by altering leg moment arms. Self-stabilization by the mechanical system can assist in making the neural contribution of control simpler.},

abstract = {Morphing, understood as the ability to undergo pronounced shape adaptations to optimally respond to a diversity of operational conditions, has been singled out as a future direction in the pursuit of maximised efficiency of lightweight structures. Whereas a certain degree of adaptivity can be accomplished conventionally by means of mechanical systems, compliance allowing for substantial reversible deformability exhibits far more potential as a morphing strategy. A promising solution to the inherent contradiction between high stiffness and reversible deformation capacity posed by morphing is offered by introducing variable stiffness components. This notion indicates the provision of a controllable range of deformation resistance levels in place of fixed properties, as required by real-time shape adaptation dictated by maximum efficiency under changing external conditions. With special emphasis on the morphing context, the current review aims to identify the main tendencies, undertaking a systematic classification of existing approaches involving stiffness variability. Four broad categories in which variable stiffness has been applied to morphing are therefore distinguished and detailed: material engineering, active mechanical design, semi-active techniques and elastic structural behaviour. Adopting a wide perspective, the study highlights key capabilities, limitations and challenges. The need for attention directed to the variable stiffness strategy is recognised and the significance of intensive research activities in a highly integrated and multidisciplinary environment emphasised if higher maturity stages of the concepts are to be reached. Finally, the potential of emerging directions of semi-active design involving electro-bonded laminates and multi-stable structures is brought into focus. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper describes a collection of optimization algorithms for achieving dynamic planning, control, and state estimation for a bipedal robot designed to operate reliably in complex environments. To make challenging locomotion tasks tractable, we describe several novel applications of convex, mixed-integer, and sparse nonlinear optimization to problems ranging from footstep placement to whole-body planning and control. We also present a state estimator formulation that, when combined with our walking controller, permits highly precise execution of extended walking plans over non-flat terrain. We describe our complete system integration and experiments carried out on Atlas, a full-size hydraulic humanoid robot built by Boston Dynamics, Inc.},

The controller solves an optimal control problem using an approximate value function derived from a simple walking model while respecting the dynamic, input, and contact constraints of the full robot dynamics. By exploiting sparsity and temporal structure in the optimization with a custom active-set algorithm, we surpass the performance of the best available off-the-shelf solvers and achieve 1kHz control rates for a 34-DOF humanoid. We describe applications to balancing and walking tasks using the simulated Atlas robot in the DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge.},

abstract = {This work presents halftoning techniques to manufacture 3D objects with the appearance of full grayscale imagery for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers. While droplet-based dithering is a common halftoning technique, this is not applicable to FDM printing, since FDM builds up objects by extruding material in semi-continuous paths. A set of three methods is presented which apply a linear halftoning principle called 'hatching' to horizontal, vertical and diagonal surfaces. These methods are better suited to FDM compared to other halftoning methods: their applicability stands irrespective of the geometry and surface slope and the perceived tone is less sensitive to the viewing angle. Furthermore, the methods have little effect on printing time. Experiments on a dual-nozzle FDM printer show promising results. Future work is required to optimize the interaction between the presented methods.},

These tools take too much time to use and force designers to specify more of the design details than they wish at this early stage. Most interface designers, especially those who have a background in graphic design, prefer to sketch early interface ideas on paper or on a whiteboard. We are developing an interactive tool called SILK that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic pad and stylus. SILK preserves the important properties of pencil and paper: a rough drawing can be produced very quickly and the medium is very flexible. However, unlike a paper sketch, this electronic sketch is interactive and can easily be modified. In addition, our system allows designers to examine, annotate, and edit a complete history of the design. When the designer is satisfied with this early prototype, SILK can transform the sket...},

Abstract Octopuses are molluscs that belong to the group Cephalopoda. They lack joints and rigid links, and as a result, their arms possess virtually limitless freedom of movement. These flexible appendages exhibit peculiar biomechanical features such as stiffness control, compliance, and high flexibility and dexterity. Studying the capabilities of the octopus arm is a complex task that presents a challenge for both biologists and roboticists, the latter of whom draw inspiration from the octopus in designing novel technologies within soft robotics. With this idea in mind, in this study, we used new, purposively developed methods of analysing the octopus arm in vivo to create new biologically inspired design concepts. Our measurements showed that the octopus arm can elongate by 70% in tandem with a 23% diameter reduction and exhibits an average pulling force of 40 N. The arm also exhibited a 20% mean shortening at a rate of 17.1 mm s −1 and a longitudinal stiffening rate as high as 2 N (mm s) −1 . Using histology and ultrasounds, we investigated the functional morphology of the internal tissues, including the sinusoidal arrangement of the nerve cord and the local insertion points of the longitudinal and transverse muscle fibres. The resulting information was used to create novel design principles and specifications that can in turn be used in developing a new soft robotic arm.

A model for sensory-motor coordination derived from studies in humans inspired the development of this scheme. A peculiar feature of this model is the prediction of the tactile image.
The implementation of the proposed scheme is based on a neuro-fuzzy module that, after a learning phase, starting from visual data, calculates the position and orientation of the hand for reaching, selects the best-suited hand configuration, and predicts the tactile feedback. The implementation of the scheme on a humanoid robot allowed experimental validation of its effectiveness in robotics and provided perspectives on applications of sensory predictions in robot motor control.},

abstract = {As a result of years of research on the comparative biomechanics and physiology of moving through water, biologists and engineers have made considerable progress in understanding how animals moving underwater use their muscles to power movement, in describing body and appendage motion during propulsion, and in conducting experimental and computational analyses of fluid movement and attendant forces. But it is clear that substantial future progress in understanding aquatic propulsion will require new lines of attack. Recent years have seen the advent of one such new avenue that promises to greatly broaden the scope of intellectual opportunity available to researchers: the use of biorobotic models. In this paper we discuss, using aquatic propulsion in fishes as our focal example, how using robotic models can lead to new insights in the study of aquatic propulsion. We use two examples: (1) pectoral fin function, and (2) hydrodynamic interactions between dorsal and caudal fins. Pectoral fin function is characterized by considerable deformation of individual fin rays, as well as spanwise (along the length) and chordwise (across the fin) deformation and area change. The pectoral fin can generate thrust on both the outstroke and instroke. A robotic model of the pectoral fin replicates this result, and demonstrates the effect of altering stroke kinematics on the pattern of force production. The soft dorsal fin of fishes sheds a distinct vortex wake that dramatically alters incoming flow to the tail: the dorsal fin and caudal fin act as dual flapping foils in series. This design can be replicated with a dual-foil flapping robotic device that demonstrates this phenomenon and allows examination of regions of the flapping performance space not available to fishes. We show how the robotic flapping foil device can also be used to better understand the significance of flexible propulsive surfaces for locomotor performance. Finally we emphasize the utility of self-propelled robotic devices as a means of understanding how locomotor forces are generated, and review different conceptual designs for robotic models of aquatic propulsion.},

abstract = {A full understanding of the mechanics of locomotion can be achieved by incorporating descriptions of (1) three-dimensional kinematics of propulsor movement, (2) material properties of the propulsor, (3) power input and control and (4) the fluid dynamics effects of propulsor motion into (5) a three-dimensional computational framework that models the complexity of propulsors that deform and change area. In addition, robotic models would allow for further experimental investigation of changes to propulsor design and for testing of hypothesized relationships between movement and force production. Such a comprehensive suite of data is not yet available for any flexible propulsor. In this paper, we summarize our research program with the goal of producing a comprehensive data set for each of the five components noted above through a study of pectoral fin locomotion in one species of fish: the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus. Many fish use pectoral fins exclusively for locomotion, and pectoral fins in most fish are integral to generating force during maneuvering. Pectoral fins are complex structures composed of jointed bony supports that are under active control via pectoral fin musculature. During propulsion in sunfish, the fin deforms considerably, has two leading edges, and sunfish can rotate the whole fin or just control individual sections to vector thrust. Fin material properties vary along the length of fin rays and among rays. Experimental fluid dynamic analysis of sunfish pectoral fin locomotion reveals that the fin generates thrust throughout the fin beat cycle, and that the upper and lower edges each produce distinct simultaneous leading edge vortices. The following companion paper provides data on the computational approach taken to understand locomotion using flexible pectoral fins.},

abstract = {The fins of fishes are remarkable propulsive devices that appear at the origin of fishes about 500 million years ago and have been a key feature of fish evolutionary diversification. Most fish species possess both median (midline) dorsal, anal, and caudal fins as well as paired pectoral and pelvic fins. Fish fins are supported by jointed skeletal elements, fin rays, that in turn support a thin collagenous membrane. Muscles at the base of the fin attach to and actuate each fin ray, and fish fins thus generate their own hydrodynamic wake during locomotion, in addition to fluid motion induced by undulation of the body. In bony fishes, the jointed fin rays can be actively deformed and the fin surface can thus actively resist hydrodynamic loading. Fish fins are highly flexible, exhibit considerable deformation during locomotion, and can interact hydrodynamically during both propulsion and maneuvering. For example, the dorsal and anal fins shed a vortex wake that greatly modifies the flow environment experienced by the tail fin. New experimental kinematic and hydrodynamic data are presented for pectoral fin function in bluegill sunfish. The highly flexible sunfish pectoral fin moves in a complex manner with two leading edges, a spanwise wave of bending, and substantial changes in area through the fin beat cycle. Data from scanning particle image velocimetry (PIV) and time-resolved stereo PIV show that the pectoral fin generates thrust throughout the fin beat cycle, and that there is no time of net drag. Continuous thrust production is due to fin flexibility which enables some part of the fin to generate thrust at all times and to smooth out oscillations that might arise at the transition from outstroke to instroke during the movement cycle. Computational fluid dynamic analyses of sunfish pectoral fin function corroborate this conclusion. Future research on fish fin function will benefit considerably from close integration with studies of robotic model fins. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {SYNOPSIS. Paired fin propulsion in fishes has classically been divided into two categories which represent biomechanical extremes in the use of appendages for propulsion: lift-based and drag-based mechanisms of thrust production. Theoretical models predict that fishes using drag-based propulsion should have wedge-shaped fins with relatively blunt distal edges, a fin beat cycle that is oriented along the anteroposterior (x) axis, feathering of the fin to reduce drag during the protraction phase, and maximal fin area during the retraction phase as the fin sweeps posteriorly perpendicular to the body. In this paper we use a three-dimensional analysis of pectoral fin propulsion in the largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, to (1) evaluate the extent to which bass pectoral fin kinematics fit predictions of drag-based propulsion, and (2) demonstrate the complexity of fin movement when the traditional two-dimensional analysis is extended into three dimensions. We attached small markers to visualize the diaphanous distal fin edge, and we videotaped lateral and ventral views from which we could measure x, y, and z coordinates from the fin and body. We divided the fin into two triangular elements for which we calculated planar (three-dimensional) angles relative to each of three reference planes (XY, YZ, and XZ) during the fin beat cycle. We show how angles of attack based only on two-dimensional data may result in gross errors that severely compromise understanding of the mechanics and hydrodynamics of pectoral propulsion. Furthermore, three-dimensional analysis revealed that bass fin kinematics are much more complex than expected on a rowing model of drag-based propulsion, and that the pectoral fins may produce drag-based thrust even during protraction. Three-dimensional kinematic data are critical to understanding the hydrodynamics of aquatic animal propulsion. Such data are a necessary foundation for reconstructing patterns of movement, modeling (both theoretical and empirical), and for assessing the extent to which motion is under active control or a passive consequence of fluid resistance.},

abstract = {Origami is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. Due to its fascinating properties, several attempts are being actively made to expand applications of origami-inspired designs in engineering. This paper presents the design of a deformable wheel based on an origami structure that was integrated with a small-scale mobile robot. The wheel of the robot employs an origami structure proposed by Guest et al. All segments of the structure are connected by links-i.e., folding lines-and this linked structure provides advantages in terms of maintaining geometry and force transmissibility. These two advantages enable control of the shape or size of the wheel by activating a certain portion of the structure. With this property, the wheel diameter of the robot is reduced from 11 cm to 4 cm by four SMA coil spring actuators. Two plate springs are embedded in the wheel to maintain stiffness and allow the wheel to recover from contraction. With the deformable wheel, the robot can pass through a 5 cm gap despite having an 11 cm wheel in its normal state. This deformable wheel concept can be used to build mobile robots that can move quickly with large wheels and move through small gaps when required.},

abstract = {Quantitative characterization of ankle mechanical impedance is important to understand how the ankle supports lower-extremity functions during interaction with the environment. This paper reports a novel procedure to characterize static multivariable ankle mechanical impedance. An experimental protocol using a wearable therapeutic robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable measurement of torque and angle data in multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously, a combination of inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion. The measured multivariable torque-angle relation was represented as a vector field, and approximated using a method based on thin-plate spline smoothing with generalized cross validation. The vector field enabled assessment of several important characteristics of static ankle mechanical impedance, which are not available from prior single degree of freedom studies: the directional variation of ankle mechanical impedance, the extent to which the ankle behaves as a spring, and evidence of uniquely neural contributions. The method was validated by testing a simple physical "mock-up" consisting of passive elements. Experiments with young unimpaired subjects quantified the behavior of the maximally relaxed human ankle, showing that ankle mechanical impedance is spring-like but strongly direction-dependent, being weakest in inversion. Remarkably, the analysis was sufficiently sensitive to detect a subtle but statistically significant deviation from spring-like behavior if subjects were not fully relaxed. This method may provide new insight about the function of the ankle, both unimpaired and after biomechanical or neurological injury. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This has become more important than ever apace with the increasing demand for robotic technologies in neurorehabilitation. This paper presents a quantitative characterization of passive and nonpassive behavior of the ankle of young healthy subjects, which provides a baseline for future studies in persons with neurological impairments and information for future developments of rehabilitation robots, such as exoskeletal devices and powered prostheses. Measurements using a wearable ankle robot actuating 2 degrees-of-freedom of the ankle combined with curl analysis and passivity analysis enabled characterization of both quasi-static and steady-state dynamic behavior of the ankle, unavailable from single DOF studies. Despite active neuromuscular control over a wide range of muscle activation, in young healthy subjects passive or dissipative ankle behavior predominated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. In human locomotion, we continuously modulate joint mechanical impedance of the lower limb (hip, knee, and ankle) either voluntarily or reflexively to accommodate environmental changes and maintain stable interaction. Ankle mechanical impedance plays a pivotal role at the interface between the neuro-mechanical system and the physical world. This paper reports, for the first time, a characterization of human ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom simultaneously as it varies with time during walking. Ensemble-based linear time-varying system identification methods implemented with a wearable ankle robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable estimation of ankle mechanical impedance from the pre-swing phase through the entire swing phase to the early-stance phase. This included heel-strike and toe-off, key events in the transition from the swing to stance phase or vice versa. Time-varying ankle mechanical impedance was accurately approximated by a second order model consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion directions, as observed in our previous steady-state dynamic studies. We found that viscosity and stiffness of the ankle significantly decreased at the end of the stance phase before toe-off, remained relatively constant across the swing phase, and increased around heel-strike. Closer investigation around heel-strike revealed that viscosity and stiffness in both planes increased before heel-strike occurred. This finding is important evidence of "pretuning" by the central nervous system. In addition, viscosity and stiffness were greater in the sagittal plane than in the frontal plane across all subgait phases, except the early stance phase. Comparison with previous studies and implications for clinical study of neurologically impaired patients are provided.},

abstract = {This paper reports quantification of multivariable static ankle mechanical impedance when muscles were active. Repetitive measurements using a highly backdrivable therapeutic robot combined with robust function approximation methods enabled reliable characterization of the nonlinear torque-angle relation at the ankle in two coupled degrees of freedom simultaneously, a combination of dorsiflexion-plantarflexion and inversion-eversion, and how it varied with muscle activation. Measurements on 10 young healthy seated subjects quantified the behavior of the human ankle when muscles were active at 10% of maximum voluntary contraction. Stiffness, a linear approximation to static ankle mechanical impedance, was estimated from the continuous vector field. As with previous measurements when muscles were maximally relaxed, we found that ankle stiffness was highly direction-dependent, being weakest in inversion/eversion. Predominantly activating a single muscle or co-contracting antagonistic muscles significantly increased ankle stiffness in all directions but it increased more in the sagittal plane than in the frontal plane, accentuating the relative weakness of the ankle in the inversion-eversion direction. Remarkably, the observed increase was not consistent with simple superposition of muscle-generated stiffness, which may be due to the contribution of unmonitored deep ankle muscles. Implications for the assessment of neuro-mechanical disorders are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2001-2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE. The human ankle joint plays a critical role during walking and understanding the biomechanical factors that govern ankle behavior and provides fundamental insight into normal and pathologically altered gait. Previous researchers have comprehensively studied ankle joint kinetics and kinematics during many biomechanical tasks, including locomotion; however, only recently have researchers been able to quantify how the mechanical impedance of the ankle varies during walking. The mechanical impedance describes the dynamic relationship between the joint position and the joint torque during perturbation, and is often represented in terms of stiffness, damping, and inertia. The purpose of this short communication is to unify the results of the first two studies measuring ankle mechanical impedance in the sagittal plane during walking, where each study investigated differing regions of the gait cycle. Rouse et al. measured ankle impedance from late loading response to terminal stance, where Lee et al. quantified ankle impedance from pre-swing to early loading response. While stiffness component of impedance increases significantly as the stance phase of walking progressed, the change in damping during the gait cycle is much less than the changes observed in stiffness. In addition, both stiffness and damping remained low during the swing phase of walking. Future work will focus on quantifying impedance during the 'push off' region of stance phase, as well as measurement of these properties in the coronal plane.},

In this paper we use this architectural advantage as biological inspiration to increase the useful work in pulling a load with a VelociRoACH, a high speed terrestrial robot. These spines exhibit anisotropic properties in the fore-aft and lateral directions, with a 2:1 holding-to-release force ratio on corkboard (0.2 N to 0.1 N). This increase in effective friction coefficient at the foot-to-surface contact points has decreased the Cost of Pulling for the VelociRoACH by ten times, allowing it to transport loads using less energy. The VelociRoACH with spines is able to engage the surface and pull up to 0.36 N whereas without spines it slips while pulling 0.2 N, demonstrating that the robot's performance with spines is now torque limited rather than friction limited. The spines also allow the robot to remain dynamically stable and resist torque disturbances.},

abstract = {— Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is gaining traction for rapid prototyping and custom fabrication. Existing toolpath generation methods for FFF printers take as input a three-dimensional model of the target object and construct a layered toolpath that will fabricate the object in 2D slices of a chosen thickness. While this approach is computationally straightforward, it can produce toolpaths that can contain significant, yet unnecessary, extrusionless travel. In this paper we propose a novel 3D toolpath generation paradigm that leverages local feature independence in the target object. In contrast to existing FFF slicing methods which print an object layer by layer, our algorithm provides a means to print local features of an object without being constrained to a single layer. The key benefit of our approach is a tremendous reduction in " extrusionless travel, " in which the printer must move between features without performing any extrusion. We show on a benchmark of 409 objects that our method can yield substantial savings in extrusionless travel, 34% on average, that can directly translate to a reduction in total manufacturing time.},

abstract = {Gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings, presumably to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance. That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models, which extrapolated the wing's performance envelope from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a semi-empirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts' behavioural envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance-with the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at speeds of 8-10 m s(-1), whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15-25 m s(-1). In fact, swifts spend the night ('roost') in flight at 8-10 m s(-1) (ref. 11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour. Morphing not only adjusts birds' wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control the flight of future aircraft.},

That this was an unacceptable situation was clearly recognized by the Abbott chemists, and the management of the spectroscopy area. This paper discusses the approach used to provide totally automated sample preparation and running of both NMR and mass spectrometric samples. In both cases, systems have been developed by which the chemists log their own samples into a database, and a Zymark robotics system does the entire sample preparation and insertion into the spectrometer. Spectra are plotted directly in the client's lab, and the spectroscopy staff need only provide samples to the robot, fresh supplies (solvents, tubes, etc.) and routine maintenance, but no actual sample handling or spectrometer operation.

Small insects like cockroaches can rapidly right themselves when upside down, yet small fast-running legged robots are much less capable of ground-based self-righting. Inspired by the discoid cockroach that opens its wings to push against the ground to self-right, we designed actuated wings for robot self-righting based on recently-developed rounded shells for obstacle traversal [1]. We measured the self-righting performance of a robot using these actuated wings, and systematically studied the effects and trade-offs of wing opening magnitude, speed, symmetry, and wing geometry. Our study provided a proof-of-concept that robots can take advantage of an existing body structure (rounded shell) in novel ways (as actuated wings) to serve new locomotor functions, analogous to biological exaptations [2]. Our results demonstrated that the robot self-rights dynamically, with active wing pushing followed by passive falling, and benefits from increasing kinetic energy by pushing faster and longer. Our experiments also showed that opening both wings asymmetrically increases righting probability at low wing opening magnitudes.},

The artificial saltatorial leg is designed to imitate the characteristics of a real jumping insect, kinematically and dynamically, and proposed to reduce the contact force at tarsus-ground interface during jumping acceleration thus optimizes the jumping motion by minimizing the risk of both leg ruptures and tarsus slippage. Then by means of high speed camera experiment, the jumping characteristics of the theoretical jumping model, the jumping insect leafhopper and the robot are compared so as to show the dynamic similarity and optimization results among them.

abstract = {Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for myriad common machines and robots. However, the design, fabrication, and implementation of artificial muscles are often limited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles. This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model is developed to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabrication method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost artificial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The artificial muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions including contraction, bending, and torsion. These motions can be aggregated into systems with multiple degrees of freedom, which are able to produce controllable motions at different rates. Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract over 90% of their initial lengths, generate stresses of ∼600 kPa, and produce peak power densities over 2 kW/kg-all equal to, or in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscles opens the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actuation systems for numerous applications at multiple scales, ranging from miniature medical devices to wearable robotic exoskeletons to large deployable structures for space exploration.},

abstract = {Human grasps, especially whole-hand grasps, are difficult to animate because of the high number of degrees of freedom of the hand and the need for the hand to conform naturally to the object surface. Captured human motion data provides us with a rich source of examples of natural grasps. However, for each new object, we are faced with the problem of selecting the best grasp from the database and adapting it to that object. This paper presents a data-driven approach to grasp synthesis. We begin with a database of captured human grasps. To identify candidate grasps for a new object, we introduce a novel shape matching algorithm that matches hand shape to object shape by identifying collections of features having similar relative placements and surface normals. This step returns many grasp candidates, which are clustered and pruned by choosing the grasp best suited for the intended task. For pruning undesirable grasps, we develop an anatomically-based grasp quality measure specific to the human hand. Examples of grasp synthesis are shown for a variety of objects not present in the original database. This algorithm should be useful both as an animator tool for posing the hand and for automatic grasp synthesis in virtual environments.},

Using NVIDIA Flex, a GPU-based physics engine, we show promising speed-ups of learning various continuous-control, locomotion tasks. With one GPU and CPU core, we are able to train the Humanoid running task in less than 20 minutes, using 10-1000x fewer CPU cores than previous works.

abstract = {In 1969, a palaeontologist proposed that theropod dinosaurs used their tails as dynamic stabilizers during rapid or irregular movements, contributing to their depiction as active and agile predators. Since then the inertia of swinging appendages has been implicated in stabilizing human walking, aiding acrobatic manoeuvres by primates and rodents, and enabling cats to balance on branches. Recent studies on geckos suggest that active tail stabilization occurs during climbing, righting and gliding. By contrast, studies on the effect of lizard tail loss show evidence of a decrease, an increase or no change in performance. Application of a control-theoretic framework could advance our general understanding of inertial appendage use in locomotion. Here we report that lizards control the swing of their tails in a measured manner to redirect angular momentum from their bodies to their tails, stabilizing body attitude in the sagittal plane. We video-recorded Red-Headed Agama lizards (Agama agama) leaping towards a vertical surface by first vaulting onto an obstacle with variable traction to induce a range of perturbations in body angular momentum. To examine a known controlled tail response, we built a lizard-sized robot with an active tail that used sensory feedback to stabilize pitch as it drove off a ramp. Our dynamics model revealed that a body swinging its tail experienced less rotation than a body with a rigid tail, a passively compliant tail or no tail. To compare a range of tails, we calculated tail effectiveness as the amount of tailless body rotation a tail could stabilize. A model Velociraptor mongoliensis supported the initial tail stabilization hypothesis, showing as it did a greater tail effectiveness than the Agama lizards. Leaping lizards show that inertial control of body attitude can advance our understanding of appendage evolution and provide biological inspiration for the next generation of manoeuvrable search-and-rescue robots.},

abstract = {We show experimentally that flapping foil kinematics consisting of a power downstroke and a feathering upstroke together with a properly timed in-line motion, similar to those employed in forelimb propulsion of sea turtles, can produce high thrust and be hydrodynamically as efficient as symmetrically flapping foils. The crucial parameter for such asymmetrically flapping foils is a properly sized and timed in-line motion, whose effect is quantified by a new parameter, the advance angle, defined as the angle of the foil trajectory with respect to the horizontal, evaluated at the middle of the power downstroke. We show, in particular, that optimal efficiency in high aspect ratio rigid foils, accompanied by significant thrust production, is obtained for Strouhal numbers in the range 0.2-0.6 for Reynolds number equal to 13,000, and for values of the advance angle around 0.55pi (100 deg.). The optimized kinematics consist of the foil moving back axially during the downstroke, in the direction of the oncoming flow, and rotating with a large pitch angle. This causes the force vector to rotate and become nearly parallel to the steady flow, thus providing a large thrust and a smaller transverse force. During the upstroke, the foil is feathering while it moves axially forward, i.e. away from the vorticity shed during the power stroke; as a result, the transverse force remains relatively small and no large drag force is produced. Observations from turtles confirm qualitatively the findings from the foil experiments.},

@article{Lighthill1970,
abstract = {This paper attempts to emulate the great study by Goldstein (1929) ‘On the vortex wake of a screw propeller', by looking for a dynamical theory of how another type of propulsion system has evolved towards ever higher performance. An ‘undulatory' mode of animal propulsion in water is rather common among invertebrates, and this paper offers a preliminary quantitative analysis of how a series of modifications of that basic undulatory mode, found in the vertebrates (and especially in the fishes), tends to improve speed and hydromechanical efficiency. Posterior lateral compression is the most important of these. It is studied first in ‘pure anguilliform' (eel-like) motion of fishes whose posterior cross-sections are laterally compressed, although maintaining their depth (while the body tapers) by means of long continuous dorsal and ventral fins all the way to a vertical ‘trailing edge'. Lateral motion of such a cross-section produces a large and immediate exchange of momentum with a considerable ‘virtual mass' of water near it. In {\S}2, ‘elongated-body theory' (an extended version of inviscid slender-body theory) is developed in detail for pure anguilliform motion and subjected to several careful checks and critical studies. Provided that longitudinal variation of cross-sectional properties is slow on a scale of the cross-sectional depth s (say, if the wavelength of significant harmonic components of that variation exceeds 5s), the basic approach is applicable and lateral water momentum per unit length is closely proportional to the square of the local cross-section depth. The vertical trailing edge can be thought of as acting with a lateral force on the wake through lateral water momentum shed as the fish moves on. The fish's mean rate of working is the mean product of this lateral force with the lateral component of trailing-edge movement, and is enhanced by the virtual-mass effect, which makes for good correlation between lateral movement and local water momentum. The mean rate of shedding of energy of lateral water motions into the vortex wake represents the wasted element in this mean rate of working, and it is from the difference of these two rates that thrust and efficiency can best be calculated. Section 3, still from the standpoint of inviscid theory, studies the effect of any development of discrete dorsal and ventral fins, through calculations on vortex sheets shed by fins. A multiplicity of discrete dorsal (or ventral) fins might be thought to destroy the slow variation of cross-sectional properties on which elongated-body theory depends, but the vortex sheets filling the gaps between them are shown to maintain continuity rather effectively, avoiding thrust reduction and permitting a slight decrease in drag. Further advantage may accrue from a modification of such a system in which (while essentially anguilliform movement is retained) the anterior dorsal and ventral fins become the only prominent ones. Vortex sheets in the gaps between them and the caudal fin may largely be reabsorbed into the caudal-fin boundary layer, without any significant increase in wasted wake energy. The mean rate of working can be improved, however, because the trailing edges of the dorsal and ventral fins do work that is not cancelled at the caudal fin's leading edge, as phase shifts destroy the correlation of that edge's lateral movement with the vortex-sheet momentum reabsorbed there. Tentative improvements to elongated-body theory through taking into account lateral forces of viscous origin are made in {\S}4. These add to both the momentumandenergyof the water's lateral motions, but mayreduce the efficiencyof anguilliform motion because the extra momentum at the trailing edge, resulting from forces exerted by anterior sections, is badly correlated with that edge's lateral movements. Adoption of the ‘carangiform' mode, in which the amplitude of the basic undulation grows steeply from almost zero over the first half or even two-thirds of a fish's length to a large value at the caudal fin, avoids this difficulty. Any movement which a fish attempts to make, however, is liable to be accompanied by ‘recoil', that is, by extra movements of pure translation and rotation required for overall conservation of momentum and angular momentum. These recoil movements, a potentially serious source of thrust and efficiency loss in carangiform motion, are calculated in {\S}4, which shows how they are minimized with the right distribution of total inertia (the sum of fish mass and the water's virtual mass). It seems to be no coincidence that carangiform motion goes always with a long anterior region of high depth (possessing a substantial moment of total inertia) and a region of greatly reduced depth just before the caudal fin. The theory suggests ({\S}5) that reduction of caudal-fin area in relation to depth by development of a caudal fin into a herring-like ‘pair of highly sweptback wings' should reduce drag without significant loss of thrust. The same effect can be expected (although elongated-body theory ceases to be applicable) from widening of the wing pair (sweepback reduction). That line of development of the carangiform mode in many of the Percomorphi leads towards the lunate tail, a culminating point in the enhancement of speed and propulsive efficiency which has been reached also along some quite different lines of evolution. A beginning in the analysis of its advantages is made here using a ‘twodimensional' linearized theory. Movements of any horizontal section of caudal fin, with yaw angle fluctuating in phase with its velocity of lateral translation, are studied for different positions of the yawing axis. The wasted energy in the wake has a sharp minimum when that axis is at the ‘three-quarter-chord point', but rate of working increases somewhat for axis positions distal to that. Something like an optimum regarding efficiency, thrust and the proportion of thrust derived from suction at the section's rounded leading edge is found when the yawing axis is along the trailing edge. This leads on the present over-simplified theory to the suggestion that a hydromechanically advantageous configuration has the leading edge bowed forward but the trailing edge straight. Finally, there is a brief discussion of possible future work, taking three-dimensional and non-linear effects into account, that might throw light on the commonness of a trailing edge that is itself slightly bowed forward among the fastest marine animals.

abstract = {Various flight navigation strategies for birds have been
identified at the large spatial scales of migratory and homing
behaviours. However, relatively little is known about
close-range obstacle negotiation through cluttered
environments. To examine obstacle flight guidance, we tracked
pigeons (Columba livia) flying through an artificial forest of
vertical poles. Interestingly, pigeons adjusted their flight
path only approximately 1.5 m from the forest entry,
suggesting a reactive mode of path planning. Combining flight
trajectories with obstacle pole positions, we reconstructed
the visual experience of the pigeons throughout obstacle
flights. Assuming proportional-derivative control with a
constant delay, we searched the relevant parameter space of
steering gains and visuomotor delays that best explained the
observed steering. We found that a pigeon's steering resembles
proportional control driven by the error angle between the
flight direction and the desired opening, or gap, between
obstacles. Using this pigeon steering controller, we simulated
obstacle flights and showed that pigeons do not simply steer
to the nearest opening in the direction of flight or
destination. Pigeons bias their flight direction towards
larger visual gaps when making fast steering decisions. The
proposed behavioural modelling method converts the obstacle
avoidance behaviour into a (piecewise) target-aiming
behaviour, which is better defined and understood. This study
demonstrates how such an approach decomposes open-loop
free-flight behaviours into components that can be
independently evaluated.},

abstract = {An image-based method for vehicle speed detection is presented. Conventional speed measurement techniques use radar- or laser-based devices, which are usually more expensive compared to a passive camera system. In this work, a single image captured with vehicle motion is used for speed measurement. Due to the relative motion between the camera and a moving object during the camera exposure time, motion blur occurs in the dynamic region of the image. It provides a visual cue for the speed measurement of a moving object. An approximate target region is first segmented and blur parameters are estimated from the motion blurred subimage. The image is then deblurred and used to derive other parameters. Finally, the vehicle speed is calculated according to the imaging geometry, camera pose, and blur extent in the image. Experiments have shown the estimated speeds within 5% of actual speeds for both local and highway traffic. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Leakage of lead and other heavy metals into drinking water is a significant health risk and one that is not easily detected. We have developed simple sensors containing only platinum electrodes for the detection of heavy metal contamination in drinking water. The two-electrode sensor can identify the existence of a variety of heavy metals in drinking water, and the four-electrode sensor can distinguish lead from other heavy metals in solution. No false-positive response is generated when the sensors are placed in simulated and actual tap water contaminated by heavy metals. Lead detection on the four-electrode sensor is not affected by the presence of common ions in tap water. Experimental results suggest the sensors can be embedded in water service lines for long-time use until lead or other heavy metals are detected. With its low cost (∼$0.10/sensor) and the possibility of long-term operation, the sensors are ideal for heavy metal detection of drinking water.},

abstract = {In this paper a new method for fast visual grasp of unknown  objects is presented. The method is composed of an object surface reconstruction algorithm and of a local grasp planner, evolving in a parallel way. The reconstruction algorithm makes use of images taken by a camera carried by the robot, mounted in an eye-in-hand configuration. An elastic reconstruction sphere, composed by masses interconnected each other by springs, is virtually placed around the object. The sphere is let to evolve dynamically under the action of external forces, which push the masses towards the object centroid. To smoothen the surface evolution, spatial dampers are attached to each mass. The reconstruction surface shrinks toward its center of mass until some pieces of its surface intercept the object visual hull, and thus local rejection forces are generated to push out the reconstruction points until they stay into the visual hull. This process shapes the sphere around the unknown object. Running in parallel to the reconstruction algorithm, the grasp planner moves the fingertips, floating on the current available reconstructed surface, according to suitable quality measures. The fingers keep moving towards local minima depending on the evolution of the reconstruction surface deformation. The process stops when the object has been completely reconstructed and the planner reaches a local minimum. Quality measures considering both hand and grasp proprieties are adopted. Simulations are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The relaxational process iteratively propagates node motions and degrees of freedom throughout a given kinematic mechanism. While relaxation methods were classically used to solve static problems, we show that the propagation of displacements during the calculation process itself reveals the kinematics of the structure. The method is slower than approaches based on solving simultaneous differential equations of motion, but provides several advantages: It achieves a higher level of accuracy, is more robust in handling transient singularities and degeneracies of the mechanism, and can handle more complex compound mechanisms with many links in multiple entangled kinematic chains. It also allows straightforward introduction of linkages with nonlinear behaviors such as wrapping strings, hydraulics, actuators, contacts, and other arbitrary responses. The basic simulation algorithm is presented, and a number of applications are provided including robotics, design, and biomechanics.},

But this autonomy of design and manufacture has not yet been realized artificially. Robots are still laboriously designed and constructed by teams of human engineers, usually at considerable expense. Few robots are available because these costs must be absorbed through mass production, which is justified only for toys, weapons and industrial systems such as automatic teller machines. Here we report the results of a combined computational and experimental approach in which simple electromechanical systems are evolved through simulations from basic building blocks (bars, actuators and artificial neurons); the 'fittest' machines (defined by their locomotive ability) are then fabricated robotically using rapid manufacturing technology. We thus achieve autonomy of design and construction using evolution in a 'limited universe' physical simulation coupled to automatic fabrication.},

abstract = {This paper presents a parametric and feature-based methodology for the design of solids with local composition control (LCC). A suite of composition design features are conceptualized and implemented. The designer can use them singly or in combination, to specify the composition of complex components. Each material composition design feature relates directly to the geometry of the design, often relying on user interaction to specify critical aspects of the geometry. This approach allows the designer to simultaneously edit geometry and composition by varying parameters until a satisfactory result is attained. The identified LCC features are those based on volume, transition, pattern, and (user-defined) surface features. The material composition functions include functions parametrized with respect to distance or distances to user-defined geometric features; and functions that use Laplace's equation to blend smoothly various boundary conditions including values and gradients of the material composition on the boundaries. The Euclidean digital distance transform and the Boundary Element Method are adapted to the efficient computation of composition functions. Theoretical and experimental complexity, accuracy and convergence analyses are presented. The representations underlying the composition design features are analytic in nature and therefore concise. Evaluation for visualization and fabrication is performed only at the resolutions required for these purposes, thereby reducing the computational burden. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This method relies on a feature fitting algorithm incorporated into the boundary evolvement process in order to regulate the noisy velocity fields and thus introduce new explicit feature primitives; once inserted, the feature-based shape optimization algorithm is implemented to determine the optimum part shape and topology. The research novelty lies in that, the best-fit feature primitives are inserted during the topology optimization process while other researchers so far have reported only manipulating some existing features with the conventional level-set methods. Therefore, feature-based design can be realized without special requirement of initial input or any post-processing. From the perspective of potential applications, the engineering information embedded in those feature primitives can be extracted and integrated into the optimization formulation. Such potential integration can make the topology optimization even more useful and practical.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to modelling carangiform fish-like swimming motion for multi-joint robotic fish so that they can obtain fish-like behaviours and mimic the body motion of carangiform fish. A given body motion function of fish swimming is firstly converted to a tail motion function which describes the tail motion relative to the head. Then, the tail motion function is discretized into a series of tail postures over time. Thirdly, a digital approximation method calculates the turning angles of joints in the tail to approximate each tail posture; and finally, these angles are grouped into a look-up table, or regressed to a time-dependent function, for practically controlling the tail motors in a multi-joint robotic fish. The paper made three contributions: tail motion relative to the head, an error function for digital approximation and regressing a look-up table for online optimization. To prove the feasibility of the proposed methodology, two basic swimming motion patterns, cruise straight and C-shape sharp turning, are modelled and implemented in our robotic fish. The experimental results show that the relative tail motion and the approximation error function are good choices and the proposed method is feasible. {\textcopyright} 2010 Jilin University.},

The behaviour layer and the swim pattern layer are specially designed to match the needs for the real-time control of our robotic fish. To test the feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture, the experiment of "tank border exploration" is conducted with Q-learning. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Thermoresponsive hydrogel fibrous membranes showing directionally controlled movements and surface change with ultra-fast speed are presented for the first time. They show reversible coiling, rolling, bending, and twisting deformations in different controllable directions for many cycles (at least 50 cycles tried) with inside-out change in surfaces and shapes. Speed, reversibility, large-scale deformations and, most importantly, control over the direction of deformation is required in order to make synthetic actuators inspired from natural materials or otherwise. A polymeric synthetic material combining all these properties is still awaited. This issue is addressed and provide a very simple system fulfilling all these requirements by combining porosity and asymmetric swelling/shrinking via orientation of hydrogel fibers at different angles in a fibrous membrane. Electrospinning is used as a tool for making membranes with fibers oriented at different angles.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018 American Chemical Society. Homogeneous polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) hydrogels made from chitosan and carboxymethylcellulose were prepared in the LiOH/KOH/urea aqueous system through a freeze-thawing method. Following the treatments of sequential chemical and physical cross-linking, the resulting hydrogels with supertough mechanical strength can operate as fast response actuators under electrical stimulus in salt aqueous solutions. The electromechanical behaviors of the hydrogels are strongly dependent on experimental parameters such as electric voltage, solvent constituents, pH, and ionic strength. It is proposed that the electromechanical deformation of hydrogel originates from a dynamic osmotic equilibrium effect taking place at the interface between the hydrogel and the surrounding medium, which is induced by the migration of ions throughout the gel network. In addition, programmable 3D shape transformations were obtained by using the PEC hydrogel with designed 2D geometric patterns. Moreover, the bending actuation behavior of the PEC hydrogel can propel an adjacent object to move forward. These hydrogels are expected to be used as underwater actuators for soft robotics and other smart biomimetic systems.},

Such gradients, together with multiple length-scale hierarchical structures, represent the two prime characteristics of many biological materials to be translated into engineering design. Here, we examine one design motif from a variety of biological tissues and materials where site-specific mechanical properties are generated for enhanced protection by adopting gradients in structural orientation over multiple length-scales, without manipulation of composition or microstructural dimension. Quantitative correlations are established between the structural orientations and local mechanical properties, such as stiffness, strength and fracture resistance; based on such gradients, the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced protective role of these materials are clarified. Theoretical analysis is presented and corroborated through numerical simulations of the indentation behavior of composites with distinct orientations. The design strategy of such bioinspired gradients is outlined in terms of the geometry of constituents.

abstract = {In this paper, we report on a new technology used to implement strain sensors to be integrated in usual garments. A particular conductive mixture based on commercial products is realized and directly spread over a piece of fabric, which shows, after the treatment, piezoresistive properties, i.e., a change in resistance when it is strained. This property is exploited to realize sensorized garments such as gloves, leotards, and seat covers capable of reconstructing and monitoring body shape, posture, and gesture. In general, this technology is a good candidate for adherent wearable systems with excellent mechanical coupling with body surface. Here, we mainly focused on a sensorized glove able to detect posture and movements of the fingers. It could be used in several fields of application. We report on experimental results of a sensorized glove used as movements recorder for rehabilitation therapies and medicine. Furthermore, we describe a dedicated methodology used to read the output sensors which allowed to avoid using metallic wires for the connections. The price to be paid for all these advantages is a nonlinear electric response of the fabric sensor and a too long settling time, that in principle, make these sensors not suitable for real-time applications. Here we propose a hardware and computational solution to overcome this limitation.},

abstract = {Biomimetic robots borrow their senses and structure from animals, such as insects, fish and birds. Development of underwater vehicles is one of the areas where biomimetic robots can potentially perform better than conventional robots. In this paper, the biomimetic design and the workspace study of undulating fin propulsion mechanisms are considered and discussed. We are interested in fish with long and/or wide undulating body/fin - especially those of anguilliform, amiiform, rajiform, and gymnotiform. Two major mechanism layouts developed to mimetic fin undulations of real fish are compared and discussed. Various kinematics expressions of fin waves are presented and the model's limitation is also discussed. For a parametric study, the geometry of a single fin segment of the assembled fin mechanisms and the fin wave generated are first developed. Next, the fin workspace of the single fin segment is derived based on a defined area ratio. By virtue of the obtained fin dimensions, a gymnotiform robot, Nanyang knifefish (NKF-II), has been designed and constructed. With the fin-ray linkages with sliders connecting in series, the fish robot is able to generate arbitrary undulating waveforms. The robot's maneuvering and its depth control have also been achieved by the integration of a buoyancy tank with the undulating fin mechanisms. Initial pool testing has been conducted to demonstrate the basic performance of the fish robot underwater. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a locomotion control implementation of a robotic system mimicking the undulating fins of fish. To mimic the actual flexible fin of a real fish, we created a ribbon fin type actuation device with a series of connecting linkages and attached it to the robotic fish. By virtue of a specially designed strip with a slider, each link is able to turn and slide with respect to the adjacent link. The driving linkages are used to form a mechanical fin consisting of several fin segments, which are able to produce undulations, similar to those produced by actual fins. By virtue of the modular and reconfigurable fin mechanisms, two robotic fish with different fin layouts have been designed and constructed: The first prototype is a robotic stingray, swimming by undulations of a pair of lateral fins; the second is a robotic knifefish, swimming by undulations of a long anal fin. The locomotion scheme and mechatronics implementation of the robotic stingray are presented and discussed with a parametric study of the slider's workspace and joint trajectory. Some experimental observations of the robotic knifefish are also shown and discussed. The results demonstrate that the designed fin mechanisms are able to undulate sections of pectoral and anal fins, with different amplitudes and phases, along the length of the fin in the direction of motion. This may lead to further developments that better mimic the fin locomotion capability of real fish.},

abstract = {In the process of automating an earthmoving machine, we have developed a model of soil-tool interaction that predicts resistive forces experienced at the tool during digging. The predicted forces can be used to model the closed loop behavior of a controller that servoes the joints of the excavator so as to fill the bucket. In this paper, we extend the state of the art in two ways. First, we present a reformulated version of the classical fundamental equation of earthmoving often used to model soil-tool interaction. The new model includes consideration of previously unaccounted phenomena in the interaction of an excavator bucket as it moves through soil. Secondly, given that soil properties can vary even within a work site, we present an online method to estimate soil parameters from measured force data. Finally, we show how the predicted resistive force is used to estimate bucket trajectories},

abstract = {Programmable locomotion of responsive hydrogels has gained increasing attention for potential applications in soft robotics, microfluidic components, actuators, and artificial muscle. Modulation of hydrogel pore structures is essential for tailoring their mechanical strength, response speeds, and motion behaviors. Conventional methods forming hydrogels with homogeneous or stepwise-distributed pore structures are limited by the required compromise to simultaneously optimize these aspects. Here, a heterobifunctional crosslinker enabled hydrothermal process is introduced to synthesize responsive hydrogels with well-defined gradient pore construction. According to gradient porosity controls, the hydrogels simultaneously exhibit rapid responses to external stimuli, high elasticity/compressibility, and programmable locomotion capability. By incorporating polypyrrole nanoparticles as photothermal transducers, photo/thermal responsive composite hydrogels are formed to enable programmable control of locomotion such as bending, curving, twisting, and octopus-like swimming under near-infrared laser stimulation. The tunable pore structures, mechanical properties, and locomotion of this new class of materials make these gradient porous hydrogels potentially suitable for a variety of applications.},

A planar dynamic model is used to evaluate pitch-up maneuvers and determine suspension parameters that satisfy constraints on the contact forces for a range of flight velocities.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Hydrogels such as poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate are a class of cross-linked polymers that have the ability to absorb water and change volume. Here, a humidity responsiveness of hydrogel film fabricated by the photopolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) monomer is reported. This kind of film could be driven by a small humidity gradient, thus spontaneous deformation and motion can be achieved by placing the film onto a moist filter paper. The influence factors of humidity response sensitivity such as the exposure time and number-average molecular weight of PEG-DA monomer used during the fabrication are investigated. Under different relative humidity, the film displays different degrees of pink color and the intensities of fluorescence under 365 nm illumination are also different, which renders the film to be used as a “humidity test strip.” A humidity-driven walking device is fabricated and the walking velocity is about 3 mm min −1 under the actuating water vapor. Vapor of volatile polar solvents could also drive the actuator to achieve fast deformation and shows the variety of the film responsivity.},

abstract = {Many natural phenomena consist of geometric elements with dynamic motions characterized by small scale repetitions over large scale structures, such as particles, herds, threads, and sheets. Due to their ubiquity, controlling the appearance and behavior of such phenomena is important for a variety of graphics applications. However, such control is often challenging; the repetitive elements are often too numerous for manual edit, while their overall structures are often too versatile for fully automatic computation. We propose a method that facilitates easy and intuitive controls at both scales: high-level structures through spatial-temporal output constraints (e.g. overall shape and motion of the output domain), and low-level details through small input exemplars (e.g. element arrangements and movements). These controls are suitable for manual specification, while the corresponding geometric and dynamic repetitions are suitable for automatic computation. Our system takes such user controls as inputs, and generates as outputs the corresponding repetitions satisfying the controls. Our method, which we call dynamic element textures, aims to produce such controllable repetitions through a combination of constrained optimization (satisfying controls) and data driven computation (synthesizing details). We use spatial-temporal samples as the core representation for dynamic geometric elements. We propose analysis algorithms for decomposing small scale repetitions from large scale themes, as well as synthesis algorithms for generating outputs satisfying user controls. Our method is general, producing a range of artistic effects that previously required disparate and specialized techniques.},

abstract = {Laboratory-based courses play a critical role in scientific education. Automation is changing the nature of these laboratories, and there is a long-running debate about the value of hands-on versus simulated laboratories. In addition, the introduction of remote laboratories adds a third category to the debate. Through a review of the literature related to these labs in education, the authors draw several conclusions about the state of current research. The debate over different technologies is confounded by the use of different educational objectives as criteria for judging the laboratories: Hands-on advocates emphasize design skills, while remote lab advocates focus on conceptual understanding. We observe that the boundaries among the three labs are blurred in the sense that most laboratories are mediated by computers, and that the psychology of presence may be as important as technology. We also discuss areas for future research.

Individuals' 3-D mental rotation ability was measured by the Purdue Spatial Visualization Tests: Visualization of Rotations (PSVT:R). We integrated 70 effect sizes of gender differences in mental rotation ability measured by the PSVT:R which were obtained from 40 primary studies. The results indicated that male participants outperformed females on the test (Hedges' g00.57). The I2 statistic indicated 41.7 % of variation in effect sizes reflects real heterogeneity. The moderator analysis indicated that male superiority on spatial ability tasks measured by the PSVT:R is related to the implementation of time limits. The gender difference became larger when stringent time limits (equal or less than 30 s per item) were implemented. Keywords},

abstract = {Dynamic grasping force control for a multifingered hand is proposed and investigated. The grasping force of the finger is dynamically adjusted according to the tactile feedback so that each fingertip force always stays inside the friction cone detected by the tactile sensor and the fingertips maintain firm contact without any undesired slip no detaching from the surface of the object while grasping it. The proposed method can be applied for real-time control of the hand since it requires few numerical calculations. The validity of the proposed method is experimentally confirmed using a two-fingered hand with finger-shaped tactile sensors.},

abstract = {We extend soft lithography microfabrication and design methods to introduce curvature sensors that are elastically soft (modulus 0.1–1 MPa) and stretchable (100–1000% strain). In contrast to existing curvature sensors that measure differential strain, sensors in this new class measure curvature directly and allow for arbitrary gauge factor and film thickness. Moreover, each sensor is composed entirely of a soft elastomer (PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) or Ecoflex {\textregistered}) and conductive liquid (eutectic gallium indium, eGaIn) and thus remains functional even when stretched to several times its natural length. The electrical resistance in the embedded eGaIn microchannel is measured as a function of the bending curvature for a variety of sensor designs. In all cases, the experimental measurements are in reasonable agreement with closed-form algebraic approximations derived from elastic plate theory and Ohm's law. (Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version)},

abstract = {A pneumatically-driven robot traverses surfaces with different traction by adopting an undulatory mode of locomotion. The robot is composed of soft elastomer (elastic modulus $\sim$100 kPa), an inextensible but flexible neutral plane, and embedded pneumatic channels. In contrast to conventional robots and wheeled vehicles, the robot deforms elastically to make ground contact over a relatively large area, where interfacial tractions have a unique role in controlling both the speed and direction of locomotion. Here, we demonstrate that for the same undulatory gait, the robot will either move forward or backward depending on the ground composition. Building on mathematical principles of elasticity and friction, we introduce a theoretical model that identifies the tribological properties that determine the direction of locomotion. Though overlooked in the past, this tribology-controlled phenomenon represents a central feature of undulation on smooth, soft, and slippery surfaces. These insights provide a starting point for identifying locomotion strategies that allow soft robots, like their natural invertebrate counterparts, to navigate a broad range of surfaces and terrains.},

abstract = {A fundamental but unanswered biological question asks how much energy, on average, Earth's different life forms spend per unit mass per unit time to remain alive. Here, using the largest database to date, for 3,006 species that includes most of the range of biological diversity on the planet-from bacteria to elephants, and algae to sapling trees-we show that metabolism displays a striking degree of homeostasis across all of life. We demonstrate that, despite the enormous biochemical, physiological, and ecological differences between the surveyed species that vary over 10(20)-fold in body mass, mean metabolic rates of major taxonomic groups displayed at physiological rest converge on a narrow range from 0.3 to 9 W kg(-1). This 30-fold variation among life's disparate forms represents a remarkably small range compared with the 4,000- to 65,000-fold difference between the mean metabolic rates of the smallest and largest organisms that would be observed if life as a whole conformed to universal quarter-power or third-power allometric scaling laws. The observed broad convergence on a narrow range of basal metabolic rates suggests that organismal designs that fit in this physiological window have been favored by natural selection across all of life's major kingdoms, and that this range might therefore be considered as optimal for living matter as a whole.},

abstract = {The desert-dwelling sandfish (Scincus scincus) moves within dry sand, a material that displays solid and fluidlike behavior. High-speed x-ray imaging shows that below the surface, the lizard no longer uses limbs for propulsion but generates thrust to overcome drag by propagating an undulatory traveling wave down the body. Although viscous hydrodynamics can predict swimming speed in fluids such as water, an equivalent theory for granular drag is not available. To predict sandfish swimming speed, we developed an empirical model by measuring granular drag force on a small cylinder oriented at different angles relative to the displacement direction and summing these forces over the animal movement profile. The agreement between model and experiment implies that the noninertial swimming occurs in a frictional fluid.},

abstract = {Current Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) technologies can manufacture, directly from digital data, end-use mechanical parts in an increasingly wide variety of engineering materials. However, commercial SFF systems remain costly, complex, proprietary, and are limited to working with one or two proprietary materials during the course of building a part, hindering their broader application and the impact of the technology. The work we present here demonstrates (1) that SFF systems can employ many materials and multiple processes during the course of building a single object, (2) that such systems can produce complete, active, electromechanical devices, rather than only mechanical parts, and (3) that such multi-material SFF systems can be made accessible to, and are of interest to the general public. We have developed a research- oriented, multi-material SFF system and employed it to produce not only mechanical parts, but complete and functional Zn-air batteries, electrical wiring, flexible circuit boards, strain- gages, electromagnets, electroactive polymer actuators, organic-polymer transistors, and electromechanical relays. We have also developed and published the Fab@Home Model 1 open-source, multi-material, freeform fabrication system design. The Fab@Home project has received broad public and media attention, and more than 100 Model 1 machines have been built by individuals around the world.},

abstract = {Purpose - Solid freeform fabrication (SFF) has the potential to revolutionize manufacturing, even to allow individuals to invent, customize, and manufacture goods cost-effectively in their own homes. Commercial freeform fabrication systems - while successful in industrial settings - are costly, proprietary, and work with few, expensive, and proprietary materials, limiting the growth and advancement of the technology. The open-source Fab@Home Project has been created to promote SFF technology by placing it in the hands of hobbyists, inventors, and artists in a form which is simple, cheap, and without restrictions on experimentation. This paper aims to examine this. Design/methodology/approach - A simple, low-cost, user modifiable freeform fabrication system has been designed, called the Fab@Home Model 1, and the designs, documentation, software, and source code have been published on a user-editable "wiki" web site under the open-source BSD License. Six systems have been built, and three of them given away to interested users in return for feedback on the system and contributions to the web site. Findings - The Fab@Home Model 1 can build objects comprising multiple materials, with sub-millimeter-scale features, and overall dimensions larger than 20 cm. In its first six months of operation, the project has received more than 13 million web site hits, and media coverage by several international news and technology magazines, web sites, and programs. Model 1s are being used in a university engineering course, a Model 1 will be included in an exhibit on the history of plastics at the Science Museum London, UK, and kits can now be purchased commercially. Research limitationslimplications - The ease of construction and operation of the Model 1 has not been well tested. The materials cost for construction (US$2,300) has prevented some interested people from building systems of their own. Practical implications - The energetic public response to the Fab@Home project confirms the broad appeal of personal freeform fabrication technology. The diversity of interests and desired applications expressed by the public suggests that the open-source approach to accelerating the expansion of SFF technology embodied in the Fab@Home project may well be successful. Originality/value - Fab@Home is unique in its goal of popularizing and advancing SFF technology for its own sake. The RepRap project in the UK predates Fab@Home, but aims to build machines which can make most of their own parts. The two projects are complementary in many respects, and fruitful exchanges of ideas and designs between them are expected.},

abstract = {The need for building robots with soft materials emerged recently from considerations of the limitations of service robots in negotiating natural environments, from observation of the role of compliance in animals and plants [1], and even from the role attributed to the physical body in movement control and intelligence, in the so-called embodied intelligence or morphological computation paradigm [2]-[4]. The wide spread of soft robotics relies on numerous investigations of diverse materials and technologies for actuation and sensing, and on research of control techniques, all of which can serve the purpose of building robots with high deformability and compliance. But the core challenge of soft robotics research is, in fact, the variability and controllability of such deformability and compliance.},

abstract = {A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) DNA sensor, based on the nanoparticle amplification method, was developed for detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7. A thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe specific to E. coli O157:H7 eaeA gene was immobilized onto the QCM sensor surface through self-assembly. The hybridization was induced by exposing the ssDNA probe to the complementary target DNA, and resulted in the mass change and therefore frequency change of the QCM. Streptavidin conjugated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (average diameter = 145 nm) were used as "mass enhancers" to amplify the frequency change. Synthesized biotinylated oligonucleotides as well as E. coli O157:H7 eaeA gene fragments (151 bases) amplified using asymmetric PCR with biotin labeled primers were tested. As low as 10-12 M synthesized oligonucleotides and 2.67 × 102 colony forming unit (CFU)/ml E. coli O157:H7 cells can be detected by the sensor. Linear correlation between frequency change and logarithmic number of bacterial cell concentration was found for E. coli O157:H7 from 2.67 × 102 to 2.67 × 106 CFU/ml. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Folding is ubiquitous in nature with examples ranging from the formation of cellular components to winged insects. It finds technological applications including packaging of solar cells and space structures, deployable biomedical devices, and self-assembling robots and airbags. Here we demonstrate sequential self-folding structures realized by thermal activation of spatially-variable patterns that are 3D printed with digital shape memory polymers, which are digital materials with different shape memory behaviors. The time-dependent behavior of each polymer allows the temporal sequencing of activation when the structure is subjected to a uniform temperature. This is demonstrated via a series of 3D printed structures that respond rapidly to a thermal stimulus, and self-fold to specified shapes in controlled shape changing sequences. Measurements of the spatial and temporal nature of self-folding structures are in good agreement with the companion finite element simulations. A simplified reduced-order model is also developed to rapidly and accurately describe the self-folding physics. An important aspect of self-folding is the management of self-collisions, where different portions of the folding structure contact and then block further folding. A metric is developed to predict collisions and is used together with the reduced-order model to design self-folding structures that lock themselves into stable desired configurations.},

abstract = {In this work we describe an autonomous soft-bodied robot that is both self-contained and capable of rapid, continuum-body motion. We detail the design, modeling, fabrication, and control of the soft fish, focusing on enabling the robot to perform rapid escape responses. The robot employs a compliant body with embedded actuators emulating the slender anatomical form of a fish. In addition, the robot has a novel fluidic actuation system that drives body motion and has all the subsystems of a traditional robot onboard: power, actuation, processing, and control. At the core of the fish's soft body is an array of fluidic elastomer actuators. We design the fish to emulate escape responses in addition to forward swimming because such maneuvers require rapid body accelerations and continuum-body motion. These maneuvers showcase the performance capabilities of this self-contained robot. The kinematics and controllability of the robot during simulated escape response maneuvers are analyzed and compared with studies on biological fish. We show that during escape responses, the soft-bodied robot has similar input-output relationships to those observed in biological fish. The major implication of this work is that we show soft robots can be both self-contained and capable of rapid body motion.},

abstract = {The goal of this work is to develop a soft robotic manipulation system that is capable of autonomous, dynamic, and safe interactions with humans and its environment. First, we develop a dynamic model for a multi-body fluidic elastomer manipulator that is composed entirely from soft rubber and subject to the self-loading effects of gravity. Then, we present a strategy for independently identifying all unknown components of the system: the soft manipulator, its distributed fluidic elastomer actuators, as well as drive cylinders that supply fluid energy. Next, using this model and trajectory optimization techniques we find locally optimal open-loop policies that allow the system to perform dynamic maneuvers we call grabs. In 37 experimental trials with a physical prototype, we successfully perform a grab 92% of the time. By studying such an extreme example of a soft robot, we can begin to solve hard problems inhibiting the mainstream use of soft machines.},

Genetic algorithms are surveyed as well. Commentary is provided on three fronts, concerning the advantages and pitfalls of individual methods, the different classes of methods, and the field of {MOO} as a whole. The Characteristics of the most significant methods are summarized. Conclusions are drawn that reflect often-neglected ideas and applicability to engineering problems. It is found that no single approach is superior. Rather, the selection of a specific method depends on the type of information that is provided in the problem, the user's preferences, the solution requirements, and the availability of software.},

abstract = {Understanding how the CNS controls reach-to-grasp will require behavioral and neurophysiological studies of reach-to-grasp in the monkey, including the evaluation of whole-hand grasp with explicit force requirements. In this study, monkeys performed a reach-to-grasp task in which the size, shape, and orientation of the objects were varied. The monkeys were required to grasp each object at five force levels based on visual feedback. Seventeen positions on the wrist and hand were monitored to quantify kinematics. Hand shaping began with initiation of reach and continued throughout the reach, matching object properties even without vision of the hand or object. Grasp aperture scaled to object size. Singular value decomposition analysis of the marker positions identified two dominant hand postures. The first eigenvector or "eigenposture" consisted of an open hand configuration midway between flexion and extension that explained >93% of the variance. The second eigenposture consisted of hyperextension of all joints that accounted for another 4-5% of the variance. The two eigenpostures were similar across force levels and between monkeys. Reach kinematics consisted of a U-shaped hand path with a bell-shaped velocity profile. Trajectory and speed were independent of grasp force and object properties. In summary, hand shaping during the reach occurred without vision of the hand or object, and hand kinematics were not dependent on grasp force. Furthermore, the reach was independent of grasp force and object properties. These observations imply that the kinematics of reach-to-grasp and grasp force are controlled independently. Similar to humans, monkeys may use a simplifying strategy to reduce the degrees of freedom of the hand during reach-to-grasp.},

abstract = {The rostral part of the agranular frontal cortex (area 6) can be subdivided on the basis of its cytoarchitecture, enzymatic properties, and connections into two large sectors: a superior region, lying medial to the spur of the arcuate sulcus, and an inferior region, lying lateral to it. In this study we traced the afferent and efferent connections of the inferior region of area 6 by injecting small amounts of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent tracers (fast blue and diamidino yellow) into restricted parts of inferior area 6 and in physiologically determined fields of area 4. There is an ordered topographic pattern of connections between inferior area 6 and area 4. The region near the spur of the arcuate sulcus (hand field) projects to the area 4 hand field while the lateral part of inferior area 6 (mouth field) is connected with the corresponding field in area 4. The organization of the connections between the two fields is, however, different. The hand fields in area 6 and 4 have direct reciprocal projections, whereas the mouth field in the postarcuate cortex relays information to area 4 via a zone intermediate between the arcuate and the central sulcus. This zone corresponds to the cytochrome oxidase area F4 (Matelli, Luppino, and Rizzolatti: Behav. Brain Res. 18: 125-137, '85). The inferior area 6 also has topographically organized connections with the supplementary motor area. The inferior area 6 receives and sends fibers to a series of discrete cortical areas located in the lower cortical moiety (Sanides: The Structure and Function of the Nervous Tissue, Vol. 5. New York: Academic Press, pp 329-453, '72). These areas that form a broad ring around the central sulcus are the ventral bank of the principal sulcus and the adjacent area 46, the precentral operculum (PrOC), area SII (Jones and Burton: J. Comp. Neurol. 168:197-248, '76), the parietal operculum, and the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule including the lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus. Finally, the inferior area 6 has sparse but consistent connections with insular and cingulate cortices. The functional significance of this complex pattern of connections is discussed.},

abstract = {To face the emerging issues raised by bacterial infections in biomedical, food and environmental contexts, the combination of nanotechnologies and biosensors characteristics is increasingly seen as a promising tool to develop rapid, highly sensitive and specific devices for reliable bacterial detection and quantification. We present here the design of an electrochemical immuno-biosensor, integrating non cytotoxic silica nanoparticles (NPs), in a two-step spin coating process. Unlike biosensors that integrate a unique antibody-based layer without NPs, this new tool allows, through cyclic voltammetry measurements, the continuous and non-saturated detection of E. coli bacteria in only 5 min. and can reach up to 10 3 CFU/mL in 30 min. It offers great promises for industrial purposes as electrode functionalization is rather simple and its architecture can be tuned on demand to target a variety of micro-organisms, and the highlighted indicators (variations of current intensity, intensity ratios and/or difference of potentials)can easily be implemented in a screen displayed packaging.},

abstract = {To discover principles of flipper-based terrestrial locomotion we study the mechanics of a hatchling sea turtle-inspired robot, FlipperBot (FBot), during quasi-static movement on granular media. FBot implements a symmetric gait using two servo-motor-driven front limbs with flat-plate flippers and either freely rotating or fixed wrist joints. For a range of gaits, FBot moves with a constant step length. However, for gaits with sufficiently shallow flipper penetration or sufficiently large stroke, per step displacement decreases with each successive step resulting in failure (zero forward displacement) within a few steps. For the fixed wrist, failure occurs when FBot interacts with ground disturbed during previous steps, and measurements reveal that flipper generated forces decrease as per step displacement decreases. The biologically inspired free wrist is less prone to failure, but slip-induced failure can still occur if FBot pitches forward and drives its leading edge into the substrate. In the constant step length regime, kinematic and force-based models accurately predict FBot's motion for free and fixed wrist configurations, respectively. When combined with independent force measurements, models and experiments provide insight into how disturbed ground leads to locomotory failure and help explain differences in hatchling sea turtle performance.},

abstract = {Soft robotics is a current focus in robotics research because of the expected capability of soft robots to better interact with real-world environments. As a point of inspiration in the development of innovative technologies in soft robotics, octopuses are particularly interesting 'animal models'. Octopus arms have unique biomechanical capabilities that combine significant pliability with the ability to exert a great deal of force, because they lack rigid structures but can change and control their degree of stiffness. The octopus arm motor capability is a result of the peculiar arrangement of its muscles and the properties of its tissues. These special abilities have been investigated by the authors in a specific study dedicated to identifying the key principles underlying these biological functions and deriving engineering requirements for robotics solutions. This paper, which is the second in a two-part series, presents how the identified requirements can be used to create innovative technological solutions, such as soft materials, mechanisms and actuators. Experiments indicate the ability of these proposed solutions to ensure the same performance as in the biological model in terms of compliance, elongation and force. These results represent useful and relevant components of innovative soft-robotic systems and suggest their potential use to create a new generation of highly dexterous, soft-bodied robots.},

abstract = {Especially in robotics, rarely plants have been considered as a model of inspiration for designing and developing new technology. This is probably due to their radically different operational principles compared to animals and the difficulty to study their movements and features. Owing to the sessile nature of their lifestyle, plants have evolved the capabil- ity to respond to a wide range of signals and efficiently adapt to changing environmental conditions. Plants in fact are able to show considerable plasticity in their morphology and physiology in response to variability within their environment. This results in movements that are characterized by energy efficiency and high density. Plant materials are optimized to reduce energy consumption during motion and these capabilities offer a plethora of solutions in the artificial world, exploiting approaches that are muscle-free and thus not necessarily animal-like. Plant roots then are excellent natural diggers, and their character- istics such as adaptive growth, low energy consumption movements, and the capability of penetrating soil at any angle are interesting from an engineering perspective. A few examples are described to lay the perspectives of plants in the artificial world.},

And only had force sensors (i.e. fingers) available. The process is modelled using hybrid dynamics which highlighted the changes in contact as the essential parts of the assembly process. Qualitative reasoning is then applied to the force signals to identify those portions of the force signals that corresponded to either a gain or a loss of contact. The emphasis of the paper is to understand the force signals generated by the human subject. It is shown that qualitative reasoning proves to be a simple, efficient and effective means to understand the force signal by identifying the changes in contact state. Qualitative reasoning is also shown to be suitable for automated industrial assembly},

Currently, Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) is restricted to experts in the field, and novices may overlook potentially transformational design potential enabled by AM. This project aims to make DfAM accessible to a broader audience through deep learning, enabling designers of all skill levels to leverage unique AM geometries when creating new designs. To demonstrate such an approach, a database of files was acquired from industry-sponsored AM challenges focused on lightweight design. These files were converted to a voxelized format, which provides more robust information for machine learning applications. Next, an autoencoder was constructed to a low-dimensional representation of the part designs. Finally, that autoencoder was used to construct a deep neural network capable of predicting various DfAM attributes. This work demonstrates a novel foray towards a more extensive DfAM support system that supports designers at all experience levels.},

abstract = {The trout's tail fin is flexible, yet it propels the trout. It can do so because the flexibility is of a special, limited kind. The tail fin is not simply a sheet of compliant material. Instead it is supported by bony rays, each of which is a flexible girder. These girders can bend in agreement with the hydrodynamic load, but when they do so their structure requires that they steer the fin as a whole in opposition to the load. The fin automatically adjusts its camber so that the shape of the distribution of hydrodynamic load upon it is the same whatever the speed of the fish and whatever the path of the tail fin through the water - unless, as may be the case, parts of the swimming cycle demand a bend sharper than the fin can accomodate. If the latter occurs, cyclic variations in load distribution will result. These may be needed if the tail is to generate the forces required to match the body mechanically at every part of the cycle. {\textcopyright}1970.},

Although integrating sensors and actuators into composites is becoming increasingly common, the opportunities afforded by embedded computation have only been marginally explored. Here, the key challenge is the gap between the continuous physics of materials and the discrete mathematics of computation. Bridging this gap requires a fundamental understanding of the constituents of such robotic materials and the distributed algorithms and controls that make these structures smart.},

Using a centralized inverse Jacobian method this solution has a computational complexity of (n2.373) as it relies on matrix inversion. We describe the system as a kinematic chain and derive a distributed algorithm for computing its inverse kinematics. The presented method distributes the computation among the n segments by sequentially applying the inverse Jacobian method to m-segment neighborhoods, reducing the computational complexity of each individual operation to m3) at the expense of mn) communication exchanges and solving the reduced problems ) times across the length of the beam. The resulting solution does not require any external computation and can autonomously calculate a curvature profile to reach a desired end-pose, which has applications ranging from adaptive aerodynamic surfaces to smart furniture. The proposed algorithm has been validated using computer simulations of beams with up to 30 elements and various neighborhood sizes. Results show that the proposed approach allows trading accuracy and converge rate with increasing computation and communication.},

abstract = {This paper describes the experiences of using an advanced, low-cost robot in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. It presents three innovations: It is a powerful, cheap, robust, and small advanced personal robot; it forms the foundation of a problem-based learning curriculum; and it enables a novel multi-robot curriculum while fostering collaborative team work on assignments. The robot design has many features specific to educators: It is advanced enough for academic research, has a broad feature set to support a wide range of curricula, and is inexpensive enough to be an effective outreach tool. The low cost allows each student to have their own robot for the semester, so they can work on activities outside the classroom. This robot was used in three different classes in which it was the foundation for an innovative problem-based learning curriculum. In particular, the robot has specialized sensors and a communications system that supports novel multi-robot curricula, which encourage student interaction in new ways. The results are promising; the robot was a big success in graduate, undergraduate, and outreach activities. Finally, student assessments indicate a greater interest and understanding of engineering and other STEM majors, and class evaluations were consistently above average. {\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {A model of running is proposed in which the leg is represented as a rack-and-pinion element in series with a damped spring. The rack-and-pinion element emphasizes the role of descending commands, while the damped spring represents the dynamic properties of muscles and the position and the rate sensitivity of reflexes. This model is used to predict separately the effect of track compliance on step length and ground contact time. The predictions are compared with experiments in which athletes ran over tracks of controlled spring stiffness. A sharp spike in foot force up to 5 times body weight was found on hard surfaces, but this spike disappeared as the athletes ran on soft experimental tracks. Both ground contact time and step length increased on very compliant surfaces, leading to moderately reduced running speeds, but a range of track stiffness was discovered which actually enhances speed. {\textcopyright}1979.},

As we demonstrate with a diverse set of examples ranging from a spatial wing (left) and steering mechanism (middle) to a compliant hand well-suited for teleoperation tasks (right), our technique leads to structurally-sound and function-preserving compliant designs. We present a computational tool for designing compliant mechanisms. Our method takes as input a conventional, rigidly-articulated mechanism defin-ing the topology of the compliant design. This input can be both planar or spatial, and we support a number of common joint types which, whenever possible, are automatically replaced with parameterized flexures. As the technical core of our approach, we describe a number of objectives that shape the design space in a meaningful way, including trajectory matching, collision avoidance, lateral stability, resilience to failure, and minimizing motor torque. Optimal designs in this space are obtained as solutions to an equilibrium-constrained minimization problem that we solve using a variant of sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate our method on a set of examples that range from simple four-bar linkages to full-fledged animatronics, and verify the feasibility of our designs by manufacturing physical prototypes.},

The origami-inspired fabrication process is inexpensive and widely accessible, and the tools developed in this work allow for open source design sharing and modular reuse. Designs are generated by recursively combining mechanical components - from primitive building blocks, through mechanisms and assemblies, to full robots - in a flexible yet well-defined manner. This process was used to design robotic elements of increasing complexity up to a multi-degree-of-freedom compliant manipulator arm, demonstrating the power of this system. The developed system is extensible, opening avenues for further research ultimately leading to the development of a complete robot compiler.},

abstract = {Purpose: Material jetting approximates composite material properties through deposition of base materials in a dithered pattern. This microscale, voxel-based patterning leads to macroscale property changes, which must be understood to appropriately design for this additive manufacturing (AM) process. This paper aims to identify impacts on these composites' viscoelastic properties due to changes in base material composition and distribution caused by incomplete dithering in small features. Design/methodology/approach: Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is used to measure viscoelastic properties of two base PolyJet materials and seven “digital materials”. This establishes the material design space enabled by voxel-by-voxel control. Specimens of decreasing width are tested to explore effects of feature width on dithering's ability to approximate macroscale material properties; observed changes are correlated to multi-material distribution via an analysis of ingoing layers. Findings: DMA shows storage and loss moduli of preset composites trending toward the iso-strain boundary as composition changes. An added iso-stress boundary defines the property space achievable with voxel-by-voxel control. Digital materials exhibit statistically significant changes in material properties when specimen width is under 2 mm. A quantified change in same-material droplet groupings in each composite's voxel pattern shows that dithering requires a certain geometric size to accurately approximate macroscale properties. Originality/value: This paper offers the first quantification of viscoelastic properties for digital materials with respect to material composition and identification of the composite design space enabled through voxel-by-voxel control. Additionally, it identifies a significant shift in material properties with respect to feature width due to dithering pattern changes. This establishes critical design for AM guidelines for engineers designing with digital materials.},

abstract = {Recently a growing body of evidence has suggested that a functional link exists between the hand motor area of the language dominant hemisphere and the regions subserving language processing. We examined the excitability of the hand motor area and the leg motor area during reading aloud and during non-verbal oral movements using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). During reading aloud, but not before or afterwards, excitability was increased in the hand motor area of the dominant hemisphere. This reading effect was found to be independent of the duration of speech. No such effect could be found in the contralateral hemisphere. The excitability of the leg area of the motor cortex remained unchanged during reading aloud. The excitability during non-verbal oral movements was slightly increased in both hemispheres. Our results are consistent with previous findings and may indicate a specific functional connection between the hand motor area and the cortical language network.},

abstract = {As mass production has migrated to developing countries, European and US companies are forced to rapidly switch towards low volume production of more innovative, customised and sustainable products with high added value. To compete in this turbulent environment, manufacturers have sought new fabrication techniques to provide the necessary tools to support the need for increased flexibility and enable economic low volume production. One such emerging technique is Additive Manufacturing (AM). AM is a method of manufacture which involves the joining of materials, usually layer-upon-layer, to create objects from 3D model data. The benefits of this methodology include new design freedom, removal of tooling requirements, and economic low volumes. AM consists of various technologies to process versatile materials, and for many years its dominant application has been the manufacture of prototypes, or Rapid Prototyping. However, the recent growth in applications for direct part manufacture, or Rapid Manufacturing, has resulted in much research effort focusing on development of new processes and materials. This study focuses on the implementation process of AM and is motivated by the lack of socio-technical studies in this area. It addresses the need for existing and potential future AM project managers to have an implementation framework to guide their efforts in adopting this new and potentially disruptive technology class to produce high value products and generate new business opportunities. Based on a review of prior works and through qualitative case study analysis, we construct and test a normative structural model of implementation factors related to AM technology, supply chain, organisation, operations and strategy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution promises the integration and synergy of disciplines to arrive at meaningful and comprehensive solutions. As computation and fabrication methods become pervasive, they present platforms for communication. Value exists in diverse disciplines bringing their approach to a common conversation, proposing demands, and potentials in response to entrenched challenges. Robotics has expanded recently as computational analysis, and digital fabrication methods are more accurate and reliable. Advances in functional microelectromechanical components have resulted in the design of new robots presenting alternatives to traditional ambulatory robots. However, most examples are the result of intense computational analysis necessitating engineering expertise and specialized manufacturing. Accessible fabrication methods like laminate techniques propose alternatives to new robot morphologies. However, most examples remain overly actuated without harnessing the full potential of folds for locomotion. Our research explores the connection between origami structures and kinematics for the generation of an ambulatory robot presenting efficient, controlled, and graceful gait with minimal use of components. Our robot ‘Crease' achieves complex gait by harnessing kinematic origami chains rather than relying on motors. Minimal actuation activates the folds to produce variations in walk and direction. Integrating a physical iterative process with computational analysis, several prototypes were generated at different scales, including untethered ones with sensing and steering that could map their environment. Furthering the dialogue between disciplines, this research contributes not only to the field of robotics but also architectural design, where efficiency, adjustability, and ease of fabrication are critical in designing kinetic elements.},

abstract = {Most natural (or biological) materials are complex composites whose mechanical properties are often outstanding, considering the weak constituents from which they are assembled. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring Materials Scientists in the design of novel materials.$\backslash{\$}nTheir defining characteristics, hierarchy, multifunctionality, and self-healing capability, are illustrated. Self-organization is also a fundamental feature of many biological materials and the manner by which the structures are assembled from the molecular level up. The basic building blocks are described, starting with the 20 amino acids and proceeding to polypeptides, polysaccharides, and polypeptides–saccharides. These, on their turn, compose the basic proteins, which are the primary constituents of ‘soft tissues' and are also present in most biominerals. There are over 1000 proteins, and we describe only the principal ones, with emphasis on collagen, chitin, keratin, and elastin. The ‘hard' phases are primarily strengthened by minerals, which nucleate and grow in a biomediated environment that determines the size, shape and distribution of individual crystals. The most important mineral phases are discussed: hydroxyapatite, silica, and aragonite.$\backslash{\$}nUsing the classification of Wegst and Ashby, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials are presented. Selected systems in each class are described with emphasis on the relationship between their structure and mechanical response. A fifth class is added to this: functional biological materials, which have a structure developed for a specific function: adhesion, optical properties, etc.$\backslash{\$}nAn outgrowth of this effort is the search for bioinspired materials and structures. Traditional approaches focus on design methodologies of biological materials using conventional synthetic materials. The new frontiers reside in the synthesis of bioinspired materials through processes that are characteristic of biological systems; these involve nanoscale self-assembly of the components and the development of hierarchical structures. Although this approach is still in its infancy, it will eventually lead to a plethora of new materials systems as we elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of growth and the structure of biological systems.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the implementation of complex manipulation tasks with a dextrous hand. The approach used is to build a set of primitive manipulation functions and combine them to form complex tasks. Only fingertip, or precision, manipulations are considered. Each function performs a simple two-dimensional translation or rotation that can be generalized to work with objects of different sizes and using different grasping forces. Complex tasks are sequential combinations of the primitive functions. They are formed by analyzing the workspaces of the individual tasks and controlled by finite state machines. We present a number of examples, including a complex manipulation removing the top of a child-proof medicine bottle-that incorporates different hybrid position/force specifications of the primitive functions of which it is composed. The work has been implemented with a robot hand system using a Utah-MIT hand.},

abstract = {We have created a unique tool for grasp simulation, visualization, and analysis that allows a user to create and analyze grasps of a given 3D object model with a given articulated hand model. The grasps can be performed either automatically, where the system closes the fingers around the object at preset velocities, ormanually through direct manipulation of the joints. As collisions occur between the links of the fingers and the object, the systemlocates the contacts and analyzes the evolving grasp on the fly. Each time the grasp changes, the system updates two numeric measures of quality and recomputes 3D projections of the grasp wrench space which are useful when visualizing a grasp's capabilities. We provide examples of the systembeing used with four different articulated robotic hand models, each grasping different object models. We feel the system is very useful for hand designerswho prototype differenthand models in simulation and determine how design decisions affect a hand's grasping ability. It is also useful for researchers in grasp planning or for simulation and virtual reality designers wishing to perform realistic grasping in a virtual setting.},

Abstracting the biomechanical strategy of collision re-silient insects' wings, the quadcopter has a dual-stiffness frame that rigidly withstands aerodynamic loads within the flight enve-lope, but can soften and fold during a collision to avoid damage. The dual-stiffness frame works in synergy with specific energy absorb-ing materials that protect the sensitive components of the drone hosted in the central case. The proposed approach is compared to other state-of-the art collision-tolerance strategies and is validated in a 50-g quadcopter that can withstand high-speed collisions.},

abstract = {The stiffness of a bag containing particles can be increased by evacuating the air inside it. This stiffness-control technology, referred to as granular jamming, has been used in force displays. In such displays, the operator feels a reaction-force sensation when deforming the bag with a hand motion. The particle-containing bag can be deformed into any shape; however, the bag cannot be converted into a thin plate. This study proposes a sheet-like mechanism that, rather than particles, contains piled-stretch fabrics inside a thin rubber bag. The sheet becomes rigid after evacuating the air from the bag, with stiffness proportional to the vacuum pressure inside the bag as observed in the granular-jamming method. The sheet thickness, which is determined using the number of piled-fabric layers, is approximately in the range of 1-5 mm. The softness and stretchability of the sheet allows it to form a spherical shape and maintain that shape after vacuuming the inner air. This study demonstrates the fundamental properties of a variable-stiffness sheet and its applications in force displays.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new generation of active tactile modules (i.e., HEX-O-SKIN), which are developed in order to approach multimodal whole-body-touch sensation for humanoid robots. To better perform like humans, humanoid robots need the variety of different sensory modalities in order to interact with their environment. This calls for certain robustness and fault tolerance as well as an intelligent solution to connect the different sensory modalities to the robot. Each HEX-O-SKIN is a small hexagonal printed circuit board equipped with multiple discrete sensors for temperature, acceleration, and proximity. With these sensors, we emulate the human sense of temperature, vibration, and light touch. Off-the-shelf sensors were utilized to speed up our development cycle; however, in general, we can easily extend our design with new discrete sensors, thereby making it flexible for further exploration. A local controller on each HEX-O-SKIN preprocesses the sensor signals and actively routes data through a network of modules toward the closest PC connection. Local processing decreases the necessary network and high-level processing bandwidth, while a local analog-to-digital conversion and digital-data transfers are less sensitive to electromagnetic interference. With an active data-routing scheme, it is also possible to reroute the data around broken connections&#x2014;yielding robustness throughout the global structure while minimizing wirings. To support our approach, multiple HEX-O-SKIN are embedded into a rapid-prototyped elastomer skin material and redundantly connected to neighboring modules by just four ports. The wiring complexity is shifted to each HEX-O-SKIN such that a power and data connection between two modules is reduced to four noncrossing wires. Thus, only a very simple robot-specific base frame is needed to support and wire the HEX-O-SKIN to a robot.

abstract = {A miniature robotic device that can fold-up on the spot, accomplish tasks, and disappear by degradation into the environment promises a range of medical applications but has so far been a challenge in engineering. This work presents a sheet that can self-fold into a functional 3D robot, actuate immediately for untethered walking and swimming, and subsequently dissolve in liquid. The developed sheet weighs 0.31g, spans 1.7cm square in size, features a cubic neodymium magnet, and can be thermally activated to self-fold. Since the robot has asymmetric body balance along the sagittal axis, the robot can walk at a speed of 3.8 body-length/s being remotely controlled by an alternating external magnetic field. We further show that the robot is capable of conducting basic tasks and behaviors, including swimming, delivering/carrying blocks, climbing a slope, and digging. The developed models include an acetone-degradable version, which allows the entire robot's body to vanish in a liquid. We thus experimentally demonstrate the complete life cycle of our robot: self-folding, actuation, and degrading},

The proposed method utilizes the symmetric breaking of a 3-layered two-dimensional sheet, where an inner contraction sheet induces shear force when heated, which directs the inclined folding direction. The fabrication technique developed enables distant placements of tiling patterns of the surfaces. The experimental result shows that by applying uniform heat, a feature with 62 folds can be simultaneously folded, an advantage over manual folding. The method presented is a new instant fabrication technique for making semi-rigid structures.},

We developed a small-sized whole-body humanoid robot. The robot's body consists of 22 DOFs, lots of sensors, an onbody micro processor network, and a wireless modem. The robot's brain consists of primitive sensor-motor reflex modules running in parallel as a lower layer and an event-driven planner that starts/stops appropriate modules as a higher layer. Using this system the robot can hold, lift up, and put down various objects without knowing its size, hardness or weight.

abstract = {A mathematical model of the swing phase of walking is presented in this paper. The body is represented by three links, one for the stance leg and two for the thigh and shank of the swing leg. It is assumed that the muscles act only to establish an initial configuration and velocity of the limbs at the beginning of the swing phase. The swing leg and the rest of the body then moves through the remainder of the swing phase entirely under the action of gravity. The range of possible times of swing for each step length is computed for two types of gaits; stiff-legged walking and walking with flexion at the knee. The range of times of swing found for the model with flexion at the knee are compared with published experimental results. The agreement is shown to be very close. Typical histograms of forces applied to the ground and angles of the limbs against time are also given. The computed forces and angles have the same general time course as those found experimentally in normal walking, with the exception of the vertical force, which often has a different shape. The limitations of the model apparently responsible for this discrepancy are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {Escaping from predators often demands that animals rapidly negotiate complex environments. The smallest animals attain relatively fast speeds with high frequency leg cycling, wing flapping or body undulations, but absolute speeds are slow compared to larger animals. Instead, small animals benefit from the advantages of enhanced maneuverability in part due to scaling. Here, we report a novel behavior in small, legged runners that may facilitate their escape by disappearance from predators. We video recorded cockroaches and geckos rapidly running up an incline toward a ledge, digitized their motion and created a simple model to generalize the behavior. Both species ran rapidly at 12-15 body lengths-per-second toward the ledge without braking, dove off the ledge, attached their feet by claws like a grappling hook, and used a pendulum-like motion that can exceed one meter-per-second to swing around to an inverted position under the ledge, out of sight. We discovered geckos in Southeast Asia can execute this escape behavior in the field. Quantification of these acrobatic behaviors provides biological inspiration toward the design of small, highly mobile search-and-rescue robots that can assist us during natural and human-made disasters. We report the first steps toward this new capability in a small, hexapedal robot.},

@article{Moore2014,
abstract = {Birds routinely execute post-stall maneuvers with a speed and precision far beyond the capabilities of our best aircraft control systems. One remarkable example is a bird exploiting post-stall pressure drag in order to rapidly decelerate to land on a perch. Stall is typically associated with a loss of control authority, and it is tempting to attribute this agility of birds to the intricate morphology of the wings and tail, to their precision sensing apparatus, or their ability to perform thrust vectoring. Here we ask whether an extremely simple fixed-wing glider (no propeller) with only a single actuator in the tail is capable of landing precisely on a perch from a large range of initial conditions. To answer this question, we focus on the design of the flight control system; building upon previous work which used linear feedback control design based on quadratic regulators (LQR), we develop nonlinear feedback control based on nonlinear model-predictive control and 'LQR-Trees'. Through simulation using a flat-plate model of the glider, we find that both nonlinear methods are capable of achieving an accurate bird-like perching maneuver from a large range of initial conditions; the 'LQR-Trees' algorithm is particularly useful due to its low computational burden at runtime and its inherent performance guarantees. With this in mind, we then implement the 'LQR-Trees' algorithm on real hardware and demonstrate a 95 percent perching success rate over 147 flights for a wide range of initial speeds. These results suggest that, at least in the absence of significant disturbances like wind gusts, complex wing morphology and sensing are not strictly required to achieve accurate and robust perching even in the post-stall flow regime.},

In the n-dimensional linear spaces of forces and velocities, some classical concepts of Convex Analysis are used, but no convexity assumption is made concerning the constraint inequalities. The velocity is not supposed to be a differentiable function of time, but only to have locally bounded variation, so the role of the acceleration is held by a n-dimensional measure on the considered time interval. Dynamics is then governed by measure differential inclusions, which treat possible velocity jumps on the same footing as smooth motions. Possible collisions are described as soft, thus dissipative. Friction is taken into account under a recently proposed expression of Coulomb's law. These formulations have the advantage of generating numerical algorithms of time-discretization, able to handle, in particular, the nonsmooth effects arising from unilaterality and from dry friction.},

abstract = {Soft robots actuated by infl ation of a pneumatic network (a “pneu-net”) of small channels in elastomeric materials are appealing for producing sophisticated motions with simple controls. Although current designs of pneu-nets achieve motion with large amplitudes, they do so relatively slowly (over seconds). This paper describes a new design for pneu-nets that reduces the amount of gas needed for infl ation of the pneu-net, and thus increases its speed of actuation. A simple actuator can bend from a linear to a quasicircular shape in 50 ms when pressurized at $\Delta$ P = 345 kPa. At high rates of pressurization, the path along which the actuator bends depends on this rate. When infl ated fully, the chambers of this new design experience only one-tenth the change in volume of that required for the previous design. This small change in volume requires comparably low levels of strain in the material at maximum amplitudes of actuation, and commensurately low rates of fatigue and failure. This actuator can operate over a million cycles without signifi cant degradation of performance. This design for soft robotic actuators combines high rates of actuation with high reliability of the actuator, and opens new areas of application for them.},

abstract = {This paper present an architecture for combining a mixture of experts. The architecture has two unique features: 1) it assumes no prior knowledge of the size or structure of the mixture and allows the number of experts to dynamically expand during training, and 2) reinforcement feedback is used to guide the combining/expansion operation. The architecture is particularly suitable for applications when there is a need to approximate a many-to-many mapping. An example of such a problem is the task of training a robot to grasp arbitrarily shaped objects. This task requires the approximation of a many-to-many mapping, since various configurations can be used to grasp an object, and several objects can share the same grasping configuration. Experiments in a simulated environment using a 28-object database showed how the algorithm dynamically combined and expanded a mixture of neural networks to achieve the learning task. The paper also presents a comparison with two other nonlearning approaches.},

abstract = {We present LaserOrigami, a rapid prototyping system that produces 3D objects using a laser cutter. LaserOrigami is substantially faster than traditional 3D fabrication techniques such as 3D printing and unlike traditional laser cutting the resulting 3D objects require no manual assembly. The key idea behind LaserOrigami is that it achieves three-dimensionality by folding and stretching the workpiece, rather than by placing joints, thereby eliminating the need for manual assembly. LaserOrigami achieves this by heating up selected regions of the workpiece until they become compliant and bend down under the force of gravity. LaserOrigami administers the heat by defocusing the laser, which distributes the laser's power across a larger surface. LaserOrigami implements cutting and bending in a single integrated process by automatically moving the cutting table up and down--when users take out the workpiece, it is already fully assembled. We present the three main design elements of LaserOrigami: the bend, the suspender, and the stretch, and demonstrate how to use them to fabricate a range of physical objects. Finally, we demonstrate an interactive fabrication version of LaserOrigami, a process in which user interaction and fabrication alternate step-by-step.},

The energetics of sustained flight for small aircraft, however, limit typical applications to only a few minutes. Adding payloads and the mechanisms used to manipulate them reduces this flight time even further. In this paper we present the flying monkey, a novel robot platform having three main capabilities: walking, grasping, and flight. This new robotic platform merges one of the world's smallest quadrotor aircraft with a lightweight, single-degree-of-freedom walking mechanism and an SMA-actuated gripper to enable all three functions in a 30 g package. The main goal and key contribution of this paper is to design and prototype the flying monkey that has increased mission life and capabilities through the combination of the functionalities of legged and aerial robots.},

@article{Muller1996,
abstract = {A novel classification of planar four-bar linkages is presented based on the systematical variation of one, two or three bar lengths and studying the transmission properties (input-output curves) of the linkages. This classification is better suited to the study of biological systems than the classical Grashof-classification used in engineering as it considers the change of structural elements, in evolution for example, instead of evaluating the possibilities for the rotation of a particular bar. The mechanical features of a wide range of planar linkages in vertebrates, described by various authors, have been included in this classification. Examples are: skull-levation and jaw-protrusion mechanisms in fishes, reptiles and birds, the coral crushing apparatus of parrotfishes, and catapult-mechanisms in feeding pipefishes. Four-bar replacement mechanisms, e.g., crank-slider mechanisms in feeding systems of fishes and cam-mechanisms in mammalian limb-joints, and more complex linkages than four-bar ones, e.g., six-bar linkages and interconnected four-bar linkages in fish feeding mechanisms are also discussed. In this way, an overview is obtained of the applicability of planar linkage theory in animal mechanics to mechanical functioning and the effect of possible variations of bar lengths and working ranges in evolution. Four-bar system analysis often provides a rigorous method of simplifying the study of complex biological mechanisms. The acceptable width-range of necessary and undesired hysteresis ('play') in biological linkages is also discussed.},

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to address path planning for ribbon folding of multi-link planar structures. We first represent the desired structure with a graph-based representation of edges and nodes. We then use graph theory to claim that for any object which is represented by a connected graph, there exists a continuous path which visits all of its edges. Finally, we develop a path planning algorithm that takes into account the physical constraints of the folding machine. The input is the desired planar structure, and the output is the optimal sequence of ribbon folds for creating that structure using the minimum number of folds. The results of this algorithm are successfully used to fold various planar structures.},

abstract = {This paper proposes application of single and multiple semiactive variable stiffness tuned mass dampers (STMD/SMTMD) for response control of multistory structures under several types of excitation. A new semiactive control algorithm is developed based on real-time frequency tracking of excitation signal by short time Fourier transform. A parametric study is performed in the frequency domain to investigate the dynamic characteristics and effectiveness of STMDs. Time history responses of single-degree-of-freedom and five-degree-of-freedom structures equipped with STMDs at the roof level, subjected to harmonic, stationary, and nonstationary excitations are presented. STMD/SMTMD are most effective when they have low damping ratios and the excitation frequency can be tracked. They are superior than their passive counterparts in reducing the response of the main structure both under force and base excitations. In case the fundamental frequency changes due to damage or deterioration of the main structure then the TMD will be off-tune; hence, it will lose its effectiveness significantly, whereas, the STMD is robust against such changes as it is always tuned to the excitation frequency. {\textcopyright} 2007 ASCE.},

abstract = {There are two major structural paradigms in robotics: soft machines, which are conformable, durable, and safe; and traditional rigid robots, which are fast, precise, and capable of applying high forces. Here, the paradigms are bridged by enabling soft machines to behave like traditional rigid robots on command. This task is accomplished via laminar jamming, a structural phenomenon in which a laminate of compliant strips becomes strongly coupled through friction when a pressure gradient is applied, causing dramatic changes in mechanical properties. Rigorous analytical and finite element models of laminar jamming are developed, and jamming structures are experimentally characterized to show that the models are highly accurate. Then jamming structures are integrated into soft machines to enable them to selectively exhibit the stiffness, damping, and kinematics of traditional rigid robots. The models allow jamming structures to efficiently meet arbitrary performance specifications, and the physical demonstrations illustrate how to construct systems that can behave like either soft machines or traditional rigid robots at will, such as continuum manipulators that can rapidly have joints appear and disappear. This study aims to foster a new generation of mechanically versatile machines and structures that cannot simply be classified as “soft” or “rigid.”.},

abstract = {This paper describes a developmental approach to the design of a humanoid robot. The robot, equipped with initial perceptual and motor competencies, explores the "shape" of its own body before devoting its attention to the external environment. The initial form of sensorimotor coordination consists of a set of explorative motor behaviors coupled to visual routines providing a bottom-up sensory-driven attention system. Subsequently, development leads the robot from the construction of a "body schema" to the exploration of the world of objects. The "body schema" allows controlling the arm and hand to reach and touch objects within the robot's workspace. Eventually, the interaction between the environment and the robot's body is exploited to acquire a visual model of the objects the robot encounters which can then be used to guide a top-down attention system.},

In this case, however, the benefits of this approach have been limited by the intrinsic difficulties of the task. Controlling the interaction between the robot and the environment in a meaningful and safe way is hard especially when little prior knowledge is available. We push the idea that haptic feedback can enhance the way robots interact with unmodeled environments. We approach grasping and manipulation as tasks driven mainly by tactile and force feedback. We implemented a grasping behavior on a robotic platform with sensitive tactile sensors and compliant actuators; the behavior allows the robot to grasp objects placed on a table. Finally, we demonstrate that the haptic feedback originated by the interaction with the objects carries implicit information about their shape and can be useful for learning.},

We present the design of simple, centimeter-scale modular actuation units ('Active Cells') and passive compliant nodes that are electromechanically networked to create macroscopically deformable Modular Active Cell-based Structures (MACROs). Each Active Cell is a single degree-of-freedom linear actuator (a 'muscle unit'), consisting of fiberglass end-pieces connecting two strands of Nitinol shape-memory alloy and a passive biasing spring. The Nitinol strands are coiled into a tight spring to increase deformations when activated through resistive heating. In-depth examination of the optimization of Nitinol coils with an antagonistic spring is presented, resulting in large repeatable axial cell strains of up to 25%. The design of these cellular muscle units to obtain maximal repeatable stroke is presented, allowing for the construction of larger networks of cells (MACRO modules, akin to a biological 'tissue') that can be customized to a target application. Finally, experimental demonstration of the construction and actuation of some simple MACRO modules is described.},

Recent advances in the mechanistic understanding of biosynthetic compound materials, computer-aided design approaches in molecular synthetic biology 4,5 and traditional soft robotics, and increasing aptitude in generating structural and chemical micro environments that promote cellular self-organization have enhanced the ability to recapitulate such hierarchical architecture in engineered biological systems. Here we combined these capabilities in a systematic design strategy to reverse engineer a muscular pump. We report the construction of a freely swimming jellyfish from chemically dissociated rat tissue and silicone polymer as a proof of concept. The constructs, termed 'medusoids', were designed with computer simulations and experiments to match key determinants of jellyfish propulsion and feeding performance by quantitatively mimicking structural design, stroke kinematics and animal-fluid interactions. The combination of the engineering design algorithm with quantitative benchmarks of physiological performance suggests that our strategy is broadly applicable to reverse engineering of muscular organs or simple life forms that pump to survive.},

abstract = {Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based immunotherapy can induce antitumor responses in about 25% of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The limited effect and the severe side-effects of IL-2 have led us to perform a prognostic factor analysis. Twenty-four patients with metastatic RCC were treated with IL-2. Flow cytometry and immunohistology were used to determine DNA ploidy, HLA-II expression on tumor cells, and the presence of macrophages in the primary tumor. These variables were examined in relation to survival. The 4-year overall survival rate was 38%. Forty-six percent of the primary tumors were aneuploid. All tumors, except one, showed HLA-II expression and macrophage presence. A statistically significant correlation (r = 0.66, P = 0.002) was found between HLA-II expression and macrophage presence. Patients with high HLA-II expression had a lower 4-year survival (22% compared to 50%), as had patients with high macrophage presence (20% compared to 42%). Of note, patients characterized by both high HLA-II and high macrophage expression had the worst survival (13% compared to 50%). We concluded that DNA ploidy was not predictive for survival, whereas HLA-II expression and macrophage presence may represent valuable prognostic factors related to survival. The present data suggest that more of the patients with no or moderate HLA-II expression and/or no or moderate macrophage presence in the primary tumor could survive with persistence of their malignant disease after having received IL-2 immunotherapy, as compared to patients with both high HLA-II and high macrophage expression.},

abstract = {This work describes a deployable compliant rolling-contact element joint (D-CORE joint) that employs curved-folding origami techniques to enable transition from a flat to deployed state. These deployable joints can be manufactured from a single sheet of material. Two fundamental configurations of the D-CORE are presented. The first configuration allows for motion similar to that of a Jacob's ladder when the joint is in a planar state while achieving the motion of a CORE when in the deployed state. The second configuration constrains all degrees of freedom to create a static structure when the joint is in the planar state and allows for the motion of a CORE in the deployed state. Curved-folding origami techniques can be used with both configurations to control the cam radius and range of motion of the D-CORE. Physical models are demonstrated in Tyvek{\textregistered}, polycarbonate, polypropylene, and metallic glass. A deployable translating platform constructed of an inversion of the D-CORE is also shown.},

abstract = {— In this paper we address the problem of multi-robot localization with a heterogeneous team of low-cost mobile robots. The team consists of a single centralized observer with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and monocular camera, and multiple picket robots with only IMUs and Red Green Blue (RGB) light emitting diodes (LED). This team cooperatively navigates a visually featureless environment while localizing all robots. A combination of camera imagery captured by the observer and IMU measurements from the pickets and observer are fused to estimate motion of the team. A team movement strategy, referred to as inchworm, is formulated as follows: Pickets move ahead of the observer and then act as temporary landmarks for the observer to follow. This cooperative approach employs a single Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to localize the entire heterogeneous multi-robot team, using a formulation of the measurement Jacobian to relate the pose of the observer to the poses of the pickets with respect to the global reference frame. An initial experiment with the inchworm strategy has shown localization within 0.14 m position error and 2.18 • orientation error over a path-length of 5 meters in an environment with irregular ground, partial occlusions, and a ramp. This demonstrates improvement over a camera-only localization technique that was adapted to our team dynamic which produced 0.18m position error and 3.12 • orientation error over the same dataset. In addition, we demonstrate improvement in localization accuracy with an increasing number of picket robots.},

abstract = {How fish modulate their fin stiffness during locomotive manoeuvres remains unknown. We show that changing the fin's curvature modulates its stiffness. Modelling the fin as bendable bony rays held together by a membrane, we deduce that fin curvature is manifested as a misalignment of the principal bending axes between neighbouring rays. An external force causes neighbouring rays to bend and splay apart, and thus stretches the membrane. This coupling between bending the rays and stretching the membrane underlies the increase in stiffness. Using analysis of a 3D reconstruction of a Mackerel (Scomber japonicus) pectoral fin, we calculate the range of stiffnesses this fin is expected to span by changing curvature. The 3D reconstruction shows that, even in its geometrically flat state, a functional curvature is embedded within the fin microstructure owing to the morphology of individual rays. Since the ability of a propulsive surface to transmit force to the surrounding fluid is limited by its stiffness, the fin curvature controls the coupling between the fish and its surrounding fluid. Thereby, our results provide mechanical underpinnings and morphological predictions for the hypothesis that the spanned range of fin stiffnesses correlates with the behaviour and the ecological niche of the fish.},

abstract = {Abstract Isogeometric analysis (IGA) represents a recently developed technology in computational mechanics that offers the possibility of integrating methods for analysis and Computer Aided Design (CAD) into a single, unified process. The implications to practical engineering design scenarios are profound, since the time taken from design to analysis is greatly reduced, leading to dramatic gains in efficiency. In this manuscript, through a self-contained Matlab{\textregistered} implementation, we present an introduction to IGA applied to simple analysis problems and the related computer implementation aspects. Furthermore, implementation of the extended IGA which incorporates enrichment functions through the partition of unity method (PUM) is also presented, where several examples for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fracture are illustrated. We also describe the use of IGA in the context of strong-form (collocation) formulations, which has been an area of research interest due to the potential for significant efficiency gains offered by these methods. The code which accompanies the present paper can be applied to one, two and three-dimensional problems for linear elasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, structural mechanics (beams/plates/shells including large displacements and rotations) and Poisson problems with or without enrichment. The B{\'{e}}zier extraction concept that allows the FE analysis to be performed efficiently on T-spline geometries is also incorporated. The article includes a summary of recent trends and developments within the field of IGA.},

abstract = {For 11 studies, we find that the detection of usability problems as a function of number of users tested or heuristic evaluators employed is well modeled as a Poisson process. The model can be used to plan the amount of evaluation required to achieve desired levels of thoroughness or benefits. Results of early tests can provide estimates of the number of problems left to be found and the number of additional evaluations needed to find a given fraction. With quantitative evaluation costs and detection values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations at which optimal cost/benefit ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility vanishes. For a “medium” example, we estimate that 16 evaluations would be worth their cost, with maximum benefit/cost ratio at four.},

abstract = {Jumping and landing movements are characterized by large instantaneous forces, short duration, and a high uncertainty concerning take off and landing points. Such characteristics make conventional types of control and robot design inadequate. Here we present an approach to realize motor control of jumping and landing which exploits the synergy between control and mechanical structure. Our experimental system is a pneumatically actuated bipedal robot called "Mowgli". Mowgli's artificial musculoskeletal system consists of six McKibben pneumatic muscle actuators including bi-articular muscle and two legs with hip, knee, and ankle joints. Mowgli can reach jump heights of more than 50% of its body height and can land softly. Our results show a proximo-distal sequence of joint extensions during jumping despite simultaneous motor activity. Extensions in the whole body motion are caused by the compliance and the natural dynamics of the legs. In addition to the experiments with the real robot, we also simulated two types of open loop controllers for vertical jumping with disturbance. We found that the model controlled by open loop motor command through a muscle-tendon mechanism could jump robustly. The simulation results demonstrate the contribution of the artificial musculoskeletal system as a physical feedback loop in explosive movements.},

abstract = {The design and development of morphing (shape shifting) aircraft wings—an innovative technology that has the potential to increase the aerodynamic efficiency and reduce noise signatures of aircrafts—was carried out. This research was focused on reducing lift-induced drag at the flaps of the aerofoil and to improve the design to achieve the optimum aerodynamic efficiency. Simulation revealed a 10.8% coefficient of lift increase for the initial morphing wing and 15.4% for the optimized morphing wing as compared to conventional wing design. At angles of attack of 0, 5, 10 and 15 degrees, the optimized wing has an increase in lift-to-drag ratio of 18.3%, 10.5%, 10.6% and 4% respectively when compared with the conventional wing. Simulations also showed that there is a significant improvement on pressure distribution over the lower surface of the morphing wing aerofoil. The increase in flow smoothness and reduction in vortex size reduced pressure drag along the trailing edge of the wing as a result an increase in pressure on the lower surface was experienced. A morphing wing reduced the size of the vortices and therefore the noise levels measured were reduced by up to 50%.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present locomotion learning for an Anguilliform robotic fish using a central pattern generator (CPG) approach. First, we give the overall structure of the CPG. Different from a traditional CPG that contains only coupled oscillators, our CPG consists of coupled Andronov-Hopf oscillators, an artificial neural network (ANN), and an outer amplitude modulator. Coupled oscillators, which possess a limit-cycle character, are used to generate inputs to excite the ANN. The ANN serves as a learning mechanism, from which we can obtain desired waveforms. By inputting different signals to the ANN, different desired locomotion patterns can be obtained. Outer amplitude modulator resizes the amplitudes of the ANN outputs according to task specifications. The CPG possess temporal scalability, spatial scalability, and phase-shift property; thus, we can obtain desired amplitudes, oscillation frequencies, and phase differences by tuning corresponding parameters. By extracting the swimming pattern from a real fish and using the CPG approach, we successfully generate a new swimming pattern and apply it to the robotic fish. The new pattern reserves the swimming characters of the real fish, and it is more suitable to be applied to the robotic fish. By using the new pattern, the robotic fish can perform both forward locomotion and backward locomotion, which are validated by experiments. 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Abstract This work describes an automatic method to anisotropically remesh an input bad quality mesh while preserving sharp features. We extend the method of L{\'{e}}vy and Bonneel (2012), based on the lifting of the input mesh in a 6D space (position and normal), and the optimization of a restricted Vorono{\"{i}} diagram in that space. The main advantage of this method is that it does not require any parameterization of the input geometry: the remeshing is performed globally, and triangles can overlap several input charts. We improve this work by modifying the objective function minimized in the optimization process, in order to take into account sharp features. This new formulation is a generalization of the work of L{\'{e}}vy and Liu (2010), which does not require any explicit tagging of the sharp features. We provide efficient formulas to compute the gradient of our objective function, thus allowing us to use a quasi-Newton solver (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) to perform the minimization.},

The Janus hydrogel microstrips could be easily fabricated by a simple micromolding technique combined with an initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) coating, providing high flexibility in controlling the physical and chemical properties of the microstrips. The fabricated Janus hydrogel microstrip is composed of a soft, pH-responsive polymer hydrogel layer laminated with a highly cross-linked, rigid thin film, generating a geometric anisotropy at a micron scale. The large difference in the elastic moduli between the two layers of the Janus microstrips leads to a self-bending behavior in response to the pH change. More specifically, the impact of the physical and chemical properties of the microstrip on the self-bending phenomena was systematically investigated by changing the thickness and composition of two lay...},

@article{Ohland2008,
abstract = {Ohland, Sheppard, Lichtenstein, Eris, Chachra and Layton (2008) report on large scale research into engineering student persistence. They firmly base their research on the study by Seymour and Hewitt. The authors are interested in the question how persistence, engagement and migration of engineering students compare to the expression of these factors by non engineering students. The study consists of two parts: the authors analysed data from the MIDFIELD data base that comprises record data for all undergraduate students at nine public universities in southeastern USA. They confronted the MIDFIELD data with data from the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). The second part of the study was based on the Academic Pathway Study (APS) and looks for the relationship between student experiences and decisions to pursue an engineering degree. The question of persistence 1: Where do students go after matriculation? The figures for engineering are consistent with American national averages, as Seymour and Hewitt report. Ohland et al (2008) also provide comparison data for other disciplines, finding four-year persistence rates of 40% in STM, and 70% in arts, humanities and social sciences. The authors found that 53 percent of the students who matriculate in engineering persist in it. This is the largest percentage of persisters across all academic fields. The question of persistence 2 - Where do students come from who have been enrolled 8 semesters? Nearly 93% of students enrolled in engineering after 8 semesters had matriculated in engineering. This makes engineering very distinct from other groups of majors for which the same fraction ranges from 35-59%. The other technical fields, computer science and other STM, attract over 40% of their 8th semester student population from other majors. Whereas the number of students who first enrolled without declaring a choice of major and who were attracted to other STM and CS was less than 3% of the large undeclared population, these students comprise a noticeable percentage of those enrolled in other STM and CS in the 8th semester. Again, engineering does not attract a noticeable population of undeclared students. All other groups of majors attract engineering students in noticeable numbers. The question of engagement 1: National Survey of Student Engagement outcomes and engagement scales Many of the effect sizes on student engagement indicate that there is no relationship between college major and many of the student engagement and outcomes scales. The authors state that "It could be argued that [National Survey of Student Engagement] NSSE is a measure of engagement at the institutional level, not at the level of the individual major. However, we would expect the NSSE scales to reflect students' experiences in their courses and with their faculty, which likely vary by department. Certainly students in different majors have qualitatively distinct experiences based on class-sizes, structure of the major, and content. Yet, we found that students in different majors nevertheless rated the quality of their experiences similarly.” (Ohland, et al, 2008, page 270) The question of engagement 2: Time-on-task The results of time-on-task analyses indicate that engineering students spend time in ways similar to other students in other majors. Engineering students did report spending more time each week preparing for class. Engineering students did not differ appreciably from students in other majors in their on-campus employment, time spent commuting to class, or relaxing and socializing. Engineering students were similar to other STM and social science majors in terms of off-campus work or caring for dependents. In short, while statistical significance exists among most associations tested, the associations are very low and the explanatory value of those associations is minimal. Students do not differ in appreciable ways on these items based on their major. Engineering students are more engaged in community service than STM majors, also, 60 percent do some sort of internship or academic enrichment activity, compared to 45 percent in other majors. The relationship between engagement and persistence What remains to be explored is whether there is a relationship between engagement and persistence, including the temporal aspect of that relationship, and if that relationship is similarly consistent for students across the engineering and non-engineering majors. It is not possible to explore this relationship using the MIDFIELD or NSSE databases and the authors recommend that other researchers should attempt to research this in the future.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a design method of nonlinear profile of gear ratio to utilize a DC servo motor effectively for a jumping robot. Because the larger ground force yields the higher kinetic energy of the robot body, the optimal gear ratio is obtained by the maximization of the ground force from statics point of view. Moreover, the varying gear ratio during the jump motion is obtained through a simulation which connects statics-based optimization and robot dynamics. A non-circular gear is synthesized which realizes the obtained optimal varying gear ratio. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by simulations.},

abstract = {An appropriate arrangement of finger joints is very important since the stability of grasping an object greatly depends on that arrangement. Multijointed fingers can grasp an object with many points of contact each of which is pressed against the object as if wrapping up that object. The amount of the wrapped up area and the form of the finger when an object is grasped are therefore important factors for determining the stability of grasping. We propose the wrapping factor to be used for the evaluation of the stability of grasping by using these factors. We consider 28 models for the finger having three joints, and perform a simulation of their ability to grasp various shapes stably. Based on the simulation results, an appropriate arrangement of lengths between phalanges for a multijointed finger is presented.},

The structure of the zygodactyl foot in the Galbulae is very distinct from that in the Pici, and no unique shared derived characters of the tarsometatarsus have been demonstrated for these two taxa. The supposedly three-headed origin of M. flexor hallucis longus shared by the Galbulae and Pici is doubtfully homologous between the two groups, leaving only the Type VI deep flexor tendons as defining the order Piciformes. This condition is probably a convergent similarity. Evidence is presented supporting a close relationship between the Galbulae and the suborder Coracii and between the Pici and the Passeriformes. There are fewer character conflicts with this hypothesis than with the hypothesis that the Piciformes are monophyletic. Problems concerning fossil taxa are also addressed.},

In this letter, we investigate the design of soft digging robots inspired by the bristled worm, (polychaetas). The behavior of soft structures in dry granular environments is complex and still not well understood. We describe the design and fabrication of a soft robot capable of locomotion in granular substrates and investigate actuation strategies for drag reduction inspired by the bristled worms biomechanical behaviors. The drag reduction experiments focus on an actuated soft leading segment. We implemented and studied two methods of actuation for the leading segment: periodic radial expansion and bi-directional bending, both of which we find to have an impact on the locomotion in granular substrates. Soft robots performing periodic radial expansion of the leading segments experienced the least overall drag force, while those with unactuated tips experienced the largest drag force, emphasizing the importance of controlling the tip stiffness to enable effective subsurface movement. Based on these results, we designed and tested a tethered, three-segment soft robot capable of digging through dry granular media.},

Here we describe a chemomechanical system of this sort based on a synthetic polymer gel. The gel network is anionic, and positively charged surfactant molecules can therefore bind to its surface, inducing local shrinkage by decreasing the difference in osmotic pressure between the gel interior and the solution outside. By using an electric field to direct surfactant binding selectively to one side of the gel, we can induce contraction and curvature of a strip of gel. Reversing the direction of the field causes contraction of the opposite side, and when the gel is suspended in solution from a ratchet mechanism, it can thereby be made to move with a worm-like motion at a velocity of up to 25 cm min-1.},

Most such materials are characterized by a fixed geometry, but in the design of some materials it is possible to incorporate internal mechanisms capable of reconfiguring their spatial architecture, and in this way to enable tunable functionality. Inspired by the structural diversity and foldability of the prismatic geometries that can be constructed using the snapology origami technique, here we introduce a robust design strategy based on space-filling tessellations of polyhedra to create three-dimensional reconfigurable materials comprising a periodic assembly of rigid plates and elastic hinges. Guided by numerical analysis and physical prototypes, we systematically explore the mobility of the designed structures and identify a wide range of qualitatively different deformations and internal rearrangements. Given that the underlying principles are scale-independent, our strategy can be applied to the design of the next generation of reconfigurable structures and materials, ranging from metre-scale transformable architectures to nanometre-scale tunable photonic systems.},

abstract = {Functionally Graded Rapid Prototyping (FGRP) is a novel design approach and technological framework enabling the controlled spatial variation of material properties through continuous gradients in functional components. Such variations are traditionally achieved as discrete delineations in physical behavior by fabricating multiple parts comprised of different materials, and assembling them only after the fabrication process has been completed. Recent advances in Computational Topology Design (CTD) and Solid Free-Form Fabrication (SFF) are promoting the creation of building components with controlled micro-, and macro-architectural features. The FGRP approach combines a novel software environment with a mechanical output tool designed as a 3-D printer to allow computer control of material distribution within a monolithic structure. Inspired by the integration of material, structure and form found in natural systems, this biologically inspired design approach allows for physical prototyping of graduated properties in product and architectural design scales. FGRP introduces the potential to dynamically mix, grade and vary the ratios of different materials, resulting in continuous gradients, and structurally optimized designs with efficient use of materials, reductions in waste and production of highly customizable features. The paper presents the FGRP technology as part of an overall integrated design approach to functionally gradient design fabrication. Two work-in-progress explorations of FGRP implementation are presented: a robotic arm able to 3-D print concrete with controllable density and a 3-D printer for UV-curable polymers exploring variable elasticity. Research methods and processes devised for its development are presented and design applications demonstrated. Current technological limitations and future directions are discussed and their implications reviewed. ?? 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {As an emerging field, soft-bodied robots require profoundly different approaches to sensing and actuation compared to their rigid-bodied counterparts. Electro-mechanical design, fabrication, and operational challenges due to material elasticity significantly complicate embedded, modular and precise proprioceptive feedback. This work presents a novel curvature sensor module to address the unique soft robotic specifications. The proposed device utilizes a magnet and an electronic Hall effect sensing component to accurately measure curvatures on a soft-bodied bending segment on a flexible circuit board, ensuring contact-free sensing. We verify performance of sensor modules on static and dynamic bending deformations based on a single initial calibration step. To the best of our knowledge, the presented device is the first modular and integrated soft-bodied sensor design that is demonstrated to be accurate up to 7.5 Hz with a root mean square error of 0.023 cm-1between measured and actual curvature without filtering out the intrinsic noise, and available for use with soft-bodied kinematic bending chains.},

abstract = {— Soft robotics carries with the promise of making robots as capable and adaptable as biological creatures, but this will not be possible without the ability to perform self-sensing and control with precision and repeatability. In this paper, we seek to address this need with the development of a new pneumatically-actuated soft bending actuation module with integrated curvature sensing. We designed and fabricated two different versions of this module: one with a commercially available resistive flex sensor and the other with a magnetic curvature sensor of our own design, and used an external motion capture system to calibrate and verify the validity of these two modules. In addition, we used an iterative sliding mode controller to drive the modules through step curvature references to demonstrate the controllability of the modules as well as compare the usability of the two sensors. We found that the magnetic sensor returned noisy but accurate data, while the flex sensor was inaccurate and subject to drift but did not exhibit notable noise. Experimental results show that this phenomenon of drift from the flex sensor causes active feedback control of the bending actuator to exhibit significant positioning errors. This work demonstrates that our soft bending actuator can be controlled with repeatability and precision, and that our magnetic curvature sensor represents an improvement for use in closed-loop control of soft robotic devices.},

KGaA, Weinheim Advancing biologically driven soft robotics and actuators will involve employing different scaffold geometries and cellular constructs to enable a controllable emergence for increased production of force. By using hydrogel scaffolds and muscle tissue, soft biological robotic actuators that are capable of motility have been successfully engineered with varying morphologies. Having the flexibility of altering geometry while ensuring tissue viability can enable advancing functional output from these machines through the implementation of new construction concepts and fabrication approaches. This study reports a forward engineering approach to computationally design the next generation of biological machines via direct numerical simulations. This was subsequently followed by fabrication and characterization of high force producing biological machines. These biological machines show millinewton forces capable of driving locomotion at speeds above 0.5 mm s−1. It is important to note that these results are predicted by computational simulations, ultimately showing excellent agreement of the predictive models and experimental results, further providing the ability to forward design future generations of these biological machines. This study aims to develop the building blocks and modular technologies capable of scaling force and complexity of these devices for applications toward solving real world problems in medicine, environment, and manufacturing.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges in the development of microrobots, i.e. robots at the sub-millimeter scale, is the difficulty of adopting traditional solutions for power, control and, especially, actuation. As a result, most current microrobots are directly manipulated by external fields, and possess only a few passive degrees of freedom (DOFs). We have reported a strategy that enables embodiment, remote powering and control of a large number of DOFs in mobile soft microrobots. These consist of photo-responsive materials, such that the actuation of their soft continuous body can be selectively and dynamically controlled by structured light fields. Here we use finite-element modelling to evaluate the effective number of DOFs that are addressable in our microrobots. We also demonstrate that by this flexible approach different actuation patterns can be obtained, and thus different locomotion performances can be achieved within the very same microrobot. The reported results confirm the versatility of the proposed approach, which allows for easy application-specific optimization and online reconfiguration of the microrobot's behavior. Such versatility will enable advanced applications of robotics and automation at the micro scale.},

In contrast, current artificial microrobots cannot actively deform, exhibiting at best passive bending under external fields. Here, by taking advantage of the wireless, scalable and spatiotemporally selective capabilities that light allows, we show that soft microrobots consisting of photoactive liquid-crystal elastomers can be driven by structured monochromatic light to perform sophisticated biomimetic motions. We realize continuum yet selectively addressable artificial microswimmers that generate travelling-wave motions to self-propel without external forces or torques, as well as microrobots capable of versatile locomotion behaviours on demand. Both theoretical predictions and experimental results confirm that multiple gaits, mimicking either symplectic or antiplectic metachrony of ciliate protozoa, can be achieved with single microswimmers. The principle of using structured light can be extended to other applications that require microscale actuation with sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination for advanced microrobotic technologies.},

Using the Kirchhoff rod and F{\"{o}}ppl-von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n plate equations, we study the stability, deformation modes, and snap-through dynamics of an elastic arch with clamped boundaries and subject to a concentrated load. For parameters typical of everyday and technological applications of snapping, we show that the stretchability of the arch plays a critical role in determining not only the post-buckling mode of deformation but also the timescale of snapping and the frequency of the arch's vibrations about its final equilibrium state. We show that the growth rate of the snap-through instability and its subsequent ringing frequency can both be interpreted physically as the result of a sound wave in the material propagating over a distance comparable to the length of the arch. Finally, we extend our analysis of the ringing frequency of indented arches to understand the “pop” heard when everted shell structures snap-through to their stable state. Remarkably, we find that not only are the scaling laws for the ringing frequencies in these two scenarios identical but also the respective prefactors are numerically close; this allows us to develop a master curve for the frequency of ringing in snapping beams and shells.},

abstract = {Because the dynamics of wrist rotations are dominated by stiffness, understanding wrist rotations requires a thorough characterization of wrist stiffness in multiple degrees of freedom. The only prior measurement of multivariable wrist stiffness was confined to approximately one-seventh of the wrist range of motion (ROM). Here, we present a precise nonlinear characterization of passive wrist joint stiffness over a range three times greater, which covers approximately 70% of the functional ROM of the wrist. We measured the torque-displacement vector field in 24 directions and fit the data using thin-plate spline smoothing optimized with generalized cross validation. To assess anisotropy and nonlinearity, we subsequently derived several different approximations of the stiffness due to this multivariable vector field. The directional variation of stiffness was more pronounced than reported previously. A linear approximation (obtained by multiple linear regression over the entire field) was significantly more anisotropic (eigenvalue ratio of 2.69 ± 0.52 versus 1.58 ± 0.39; p < 0.001) though less misaligned with the anatomical wrist axes (12.1 ± 4.6° versus 21.2 ± 9.2°; p < 0.001). We also found that stiffness over this range exhibited considerable nonlinearity - the error associated with a linear approximation was 20-30%. The nonlinear characterization over this greater range confirmed significantly greater stiffness in radial deviation compared to ulnar deviation. This study provides a characterization of passive wrist stiffness better suited to investigations of natural wrist rotations, which cover much of the wrist's ROM. It also provides a baseline for the study of neurological and/or orthopedic disorders that result in abnormal wrist stiffness. {\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Abstract The world is experiencing an unprecedented, enduring, and pervasive aging process. With more people who need walking assistance, the demand for gait rehabilitation has increased rapidly over the years. Effective gait rehabilitation requires a comprehensive gait analysis, in which gait phase detection plays an important role. Although many specialized sensing systems have been developed for gait monitoring, most existing gait phase detection algorithms rely on significant input from medical professionals, which are subjective, manual and inaccurate. To address these problems, this paper presents a data-driven approach for real-time gait phase detection. The approach combines an infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) to classify different gait phases based on the ground contact force (GCF) measurement, and a parallel particle filter to estimate and update the model parameters. Effective particle sharing mechanisms are further designed to distribute particles among different working nodes judiciously and thus strike a good balance between computational overhead and estimation accuracy. The proposed algorithm is implemented in our gait monitoring and analysis platform developed on a {VMware} cluster. Its estimation accuracy and computational efficiency are examined through extensive experiments using the data traces collected from both healthy human subjects and patients with neurological disorders.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a bounding gait control algorithm that allows a variable-speed running in the MIT Cheetah 2. A simple impulse planning algorithm is proposed to design vertical and horizontal force profiles which make net impulse on the system during one cycle zero. This design of force profiles leads to the conservation of linear momentum over a complete step, providing periodicity in horizontal and vertical velocity. When designed profiles are applied to the system, periodic orbits with an ability to change running speed are obtained. A virtual compliance control in the horizontal and vertical direction has been added onto the designed force profiles to stabilize the periodic orbits. The experimental results show that the algorithm successfully achieved untethered 3D running of the MIT Cheetah 2, with speeds ranging from 0 m/sec to 4.5 m/sec on treadmills as well as on grassy fields.},

The paper introduces the architecture of the controller along with the functional roles of its subcomponents. The application of impulse scaling provides feedforward force profiles that automatically adapt across a wide range of speeds. A discrete gait pattern stabilizer maintains the footfall sequence and timing. Continuous feedback is layered to manage balance during the stance phase. Stable hybrid limit cycles are exhibited in simulation using simplified models, and are further validated in untethered three-dimensional bounding experiments. Experiments are conducted both indoors and outdoors on various man-made and natural terrains. The control framework is shown to provide stable bounding in the hardware, at speeds of up to 6.4 m/s and with a minimum total cost of transport of 0.47. These results are unprecedented accomplishments in terms of efficiency and speed in untethered experimental quadruped machines.},

KHR-1, which has no hands or head, has 21 d.o.f.: 12 d.o.f. in the legs, 1 d.o.f. in the torso and 8 d.o.f. in the arms. The second version of this humanoid robot, KHR-2 (which has 41 d.o.f.) can walk on a living-room floor; it also moves and looks like a human. The third version, KHR-3 (HUBO), has more human-like features, a greater variety of movements and a more human-friendly character. We present the mechanical design of HUBO, including the design concept, the lower-body design, the upper-body design and the actuator selection of joints. Previously we developed and published details of KHR-1 and KHR-2. The HUBO platform, which is based on KHR-2, has 41 d.o.f., stands 125 cm tall and weighs 55 kg. From a mechanical point of view, HUBO has greater mechanical stiffness and a more detailed frame design than KHR-2. The stiffness of the frame was increased, and the detailed design around the joints and link frame was either modified or fully redesigned. We initially introduced an exterior art design concept for KHR-2 and that concept was implemented in HUBO at the mechanical design stage. {\textcopyright} 2007 VSP.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a control method for biped robot locomotion based on impedance control and impedance modulation. Both legs are controlled by the impedance control, where the desired impedance at the hip and the swing foot are specified. The impedance parameters are changed depending on the gait phase of the biped robot. To reduce the magnitude of impact and to guarantee a stable footing at foot landings on the ground, the damping coefficient of the impedance of the landing foot is increased drastically and the reference trajectory of the landing foot is reset at its initial contact with the ground. A series of computer simulations of a 12-degree-of-freedom (DOF) biped robot with a 6-DOF environment model which consists of nonlinear and linear compliant spring-and-dampers, shows that the proposed control method works well and is superior to position-oriented control methods such as the computed-torque control method in impact regulation during foot landings and adaptation to some ground irregularity},

A key feature of the device is the two-dimensional design of the elastomer muscles that not only allows the compactness of the device, but also significantly simplifies the manufacturing process. In addition, the fabric sleeves make the device lightweight and easily wearable. The elastomer muscles were characterized and demonstrated an initial contraction force of 38N and maximum contraction of 18mm with 104kPa input pressure, approximately. Four elastomer muscles were employed for assisted knee extension and flexion. The robotic device was tested on a 3D printed leg model with an articulated knee joint. Experiments were conducted to examine the relation between systematic change in air pressure and knee extension-flexion. The results showed maximum extension and flexion angles of 95° and 37°, respectively. However, these angles are highly dependent on underlying leg mechanics and positions. The device was also able to generate maximum extension and flexion forces of 3.5N and 7N, respectively.},

abstract = {Given the increased interest in public hygiene due to outbreaks of food poisoning, increased emphasis has been placed on developing novel monitoring systems for point-of-care testing (POCT) to evaluate pathogens causing foodborne illnesses. Here, we demonstrate a pathogen evaluation system utilizing simple film-based microfluidics, featuring simultaneous gene amplification, solution mixing, and electrochemical detection. To minimize and integrate the various functionalities into a single chip, patterned polyimide and polyester films were mainly used on a polycarbonate housing chip, allowing simple fabrication and alignment, in contrast to conventional polymerase chain reaction, which requires a complex biosensing system at a bench-top scale. The individual integrated sensing chip could be manually fabricated in 10 min. Using the developed film-based integrated biosensing chip, the genes from the pathogens causing foodborne illnesses were simultaneously amplified based on multiple designed microfluidic chambers and Hoechst 33258, which intercalates into double-stranded DNA, to generate the electrochemical signal. The target pathogen gene was accurately analyzed by square wave voltammetry (SWV) within the 25 s, while the gel electrophoresis required about 30 min. Based on the developed integrated biosensing chip, the 1.0 × 101 and 1.0 × 102 colony-forming unit (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were sensitively detected with high reproducibility in the 25 s. On the basis of the significant features of the film-based molecular analysis platform, we expect that the developed sensor could be applied to the screening of various pathogens as a POCT device.},

abstract = {A theoretical model of avian flight is developed which simulates wing motion through a class of methods known as predictive simulation. This approach uses numerical optimization to predict power-optimal kinematics of avian wings in hover, cruise, climb and descent. The wing dynamics capture both aerodynamic and inertial loads. The model is used to simulate the flight of the pigeon, Columba livia, and the results are compared with previous experimental measurements. In cruise, the model unearths a vast range of kinematic modes that are capable of generating the required forces for flight. The most efficient mode uses a near-vertical stroke-plane and a flexed-wing upstroke, similar to kinematics recorded experimentally. In hover, the model predicts that the power-optimal mode uses an extended-wing upstroke, similar to hummingbirds. In flexing their wings, pigeons are predicted to consume 20% more power than if they kept their wings full extended, implying that the typical kinematics used by pigeons in hover are suboptimal. Predictions of climbing flight suggest that the most energy-efficient way to reach a given altitude is to climb as steeply as possible, subjected to the availability of power.},

abstract = {Flying squirrels are well known for their ability to glide between trees at the top of a forest canopy. We present experimental performance and behavioural evidence that flight in flying squirrels may have evolved out of a need to control landing forces. Northern flying squirrels were filmed jumping from a horizontal branch to a much larger vertical pole. These were both slightly compliant (less than 1.9 mm N(-1)), and instrumented using strain gauges so that forces could be measured. Take-off and landing forces were both positively correlated with horizontal range between 0.5 and 2.5 m (r=0.355 and r=0.811, respectively, P<0.05), but not significantly different to each other at each range tested. Take-off forces ranged from 1 to 10 bodyweights, and landing forces were between 3 and 10 bodyweights. Glide angles increased rapidly with horizontal range, approaching 45 degrees at 3 m, above which they gradually decreased, suggesting that northern flying squirrels are optimised for long distance travel. We show that northern flying squirrels initiate full gliding posture at ranges of less than 1 m, without landing any higher than an equivalent ballistic projectile. However, this gliding posture enables them to pitch upwards, potentially stalling the wing, and spreads the landing reaction force over all four extended limbs. At steeper approach angles of close to 45 degrees , flying squirrels were unable to pitch up sufficiently and landed forelimbs first, consequently sustaining higher impact forces. We investigate four hypotheses to explain the origin of flight in these animals and conclude that the need to reduce landing impact forces was most likely to have stimulated the development of aerial control in flying squirrels.},

We are proposing a new paradigm for manufacturing, which we call Universal Desktop Fabrication (UDF), and a framework for its development. UDF will be a coherent system of volumetric digital design software able to handle infinite complexity at any spatial resolution and compact, automated, multi-material digital fabrication hardware. This system aims to be inexpensive, simple, safe and intuitive to operate, open to user modification and experimentation, and capable of rapidly manufacturing almost any arbitrary, complete, high-quality, functional object. Through the broad accessibility and generality of digital technology, UDF will enable vastly more individuals to become innovators of technology, and will catalyze a shift from specialized mass production and global transportation of products to personal customization and point-of-use manufacturing. Likewise, the inherent accuracy and speed of digital computation will allow processes that significantly surpass the practical complexity of the current design and manufacturing systems. This transformation of manufacturing will allow for entirely new classes of human-made, peer-produced, micro-engineered objects, resulting in more dynamic and natural interactions with the world. We describe and illustrate our current results in UDF hardware and software, and describe future development directions.},

This paper introduces robots based on tensegrity structures, which demonstrate that the dynamics of such structures can be utilized for locomotion. Two tensegrity robots are presented: TR3, based on a triangular tensegrity prism with three struts, and TR4, based on a quadrilateral tensegrity prism with four struts. For each of these robots, simulation models are designed, and automatic design of controllers for forward locomotion are performed in simulation using evolutionary algorithms. The evolved controllers are shown to be able to produce static and dynamic gaits in both robots. A real-world tensegrity robot is then developed based on one of the simulation models as a proof of concept. The results demonstrate that tensegrity structures can provide the basis for lightweight, strong, and fault-tolerant robots with a potential for a variety of locomotor gaits},

abstract = {We report our initial progress on synthesizing complex structures from programmable self-folding active materials, which we call Smart Multi-Use Reconfigurable Forms. We have developed a method to unfold a given convex polygonal mesh into a one-piece planar surface. We analyze the behavior of this surface as if it were constructed from realistic active materials such as shape memory alloys (SMAs), in which sharp creases and folds are not feasible. These active materials can change their shapes when they are heated and have been applied to medical, aerospace, and automotive applications in the engineering realm. We demonstrate via material constitutive modeling and utilization of finite element analysis (FEA) that by appropriately heating the unfolded planar surface it is possible to recover the 3D shape of the original polygonal mesh. We have simulated the process and our finite element analysis simulations demonstrate that these active materials can be raised against gravity, formed, and reconfigured automatically in three dimensions with appropriate heating in a manner that extends previous work in the area of programmable matter. Based on our results, we believe that it is possible to use active materials to develop reprogrammable self-folding complex structures. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has inspired the design of engineering devices and\r structures for decades. The underlying principles of origami are very general, which has led to\r applications ranging from cardboard containers to deployable space structures. More recently,\r researchers have become interested in the use of active materials (i.e., those that convert various\r forms of energy into mechanical work) to effect the desired folding behavior. When used in a\r suitable geometry, active materials allow engineers to create self-folding structures. Such\r structures are capable of performing folding and/or unfolding operations without being kinematically\r manipulated by external forces or moments. This is advantageous for many applications including\r space systems, underwater robotics, small scale devices, and self-assembling systems. This article\r is a survey and analysis of prior work on active self-folding structures as well as methods and\r tools available for the design of folding structures in general and self-folding structures in\r particular. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic view of the\r state-of-the-art in this important and evolving area. Unifying structural principles for active\r self-folding structures are identified and used as a basis for a quantitative and qualitative\r comparison of numerous classes of active materials. Design considerations specific to folded\r structures are examined, including the issues of crease pattern identification and fold kinematics.\r Although few tools have been created with active materials in mind, many of them are useful in the\r overall design process for active self-folding structures. Finally, the article concludes with a\r discussion of open questions for the field of origami-inspired engineering.},

The premise of this chapter is that designing prosthetic limbs capa- ble of replicating the essential functions endowed by impedance controlwould lead to more natural and capable devices. The chapter summarizes current understanding of howhuman limb impedance is regulated, and attempts at replicating the functions afforded by impedance control in prosthetic limbs. It also highlights challenges and possible solutions in each of these areas.},

abstract = {DASH+Wings is a small hexapedal winged robot that uses flapping wings to increase its locomotion capabilities. To examine the effects of flapping wings, multiple experimental controls for the same locomotor platform are provided by wing removal, by the use of inertially similar lateral spars, and by passive rather than actively flapping wings. We used accelerometers and high-speed cameras to measure the performance of this hybrid robot in both horizontal running and while ascending inclines. To examine consequences of wing flapping for aerial performance, we measured lift and drag forces on the robot at constant airspeeds and body orientations in a wind tunnel; we also determined equilibrium glide performance in free flight. The addition of flapping wings increased the maximum horizontal running speed from 0.68 to 1.29 m s⁻¹, and also increased the maximum incline angle of ascent from 5.6° to 16.9°. Free flight measurements show a decrease of 10.3° in equilibrium glide slope between the flapping and gliding robot. In air, flapping improved the mean lift:drag ratio of the robot compared to gliding at all measured body orientations and airspeeds. Low-amplitude wing flapping thus provides advantages in both cursorial and aerial locomotion. We note that current support for the diverse theories of avian flight origins derive from limited fossil evidence, the adult behavior of extant flying birds, and developmental stages of already volant taxa. By contrast, addition of wings to a cursorial robot allows direct evaluation of the consequences of wing flapping for locomotor performance in both running and flying.},

The gait dynamics of both quasi-static and dynamic locomotion are examined through the use of an on-board accelerometer, part of a one gram electronics package also containing a processor and radio. We discuss the accelerations in the context of the traditional spring-loaded inverted pendulum model seen in nearly all legged locomotion in organisms. Flapping wings are shown to provide damping along with propulsive force. The aerodynamic forces of the flapping wings also impart passive stability to the robot, enabling it to run bipedally with only a single actuator. BOLT transitions from ground running to aerial hovering in as little as one meter of runway. Overall, the advantages provided by wings in terrestrial locomotion, coupled with aerial capabilities, allow BOLT to navigate complex three dimensional environments, switching between locomotion modes when necessary.},

When initial uncertainty is high, estimation of all six parameters precisely is computationally expensive. We propose an efficient Bayesian approach that is able to estimate all six parameters in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios. The approach is termed scaling series sampling as it estimates the solution region by samples. It performs the search using a series of successive refinements, gradually scaling the precision from low to high. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of manipulation tasks. We demonstrate its portability on two applications: (1) manipulating a box and (2) grasping a door handle.},

@phdthesis{PlattThesis,
abstract = {One of the main challenges in the field of robotics is to build machines that can function intelligently in unstructured environments. Because of this, the field has witnessed a trend away from the sense-plan-act paradigm where the robot makes an attempt to model everything before planning and acting. Nevertheless, few approaches to robotic grasping and manipulation have been proposed that do not require detailed geometric models of the manipulation environment. One exception is the control-based approach where closed-loop controllers reactively generate grasping and manipulation behavior. This thesis develops and extends the control-based approach to grasping and manipulation and proposes a new framework for learning control-based skills based on generalized solutions.

This thesis extends control-based approaches to grasping and manipulation in several ways. First, several new controllers relevant to reaching and grasping are proposed, including a grasp controller that slides contacts over the surface of an object toward good grasp configurations by using haptic feedback. The number of different grasps that can be generated using grasp controllers is expanded through the use of virtual contacts. In addition, a new approach to statically-stable dexterous manipulation is proposed whereby the robot navigates through a space of statically stable grasp configurations by executing closed-loop controllers. In a series of experiments, grasp controllers are shown to be a practical approach to synthesizing different grasps from a variety of different starting configurations.

This thesis also proposes a new approach to learning control-based behaviors by applying a generalized solution in new situations. Instead of searching the entire space of all controller sequences and combinations, only variations of a generalized solution, encoded by an action schema, are considered. A new algorithm, known as schema structured learning, is proposed that learns how to apply the generalized solution in different problem contexts through a process of trial and error. This approach is applied to the grasp synthesis problem, enabling a robot to learn grasp skills with relatively little training experience. The algorithm learns to select an appropriate reach-grasp strategy based on coarse visual context. In an experiment where a dexterous humanoid robot grasps a range of grocery items it had no prior experience with, the learned grasp skills are shown to generalize well to new objects and object configurations},

abstract = {Much of the tradition in robot grasping is rooted in geometrical, planning-based approaches in which it is assumed that object geometries are well modeled a priori. Some recent approaches have chosen instead to deal with objects of unknown geometry. These techniques treat grasping as an active sensory-driven problem. At any given time, finger contacts are incrementally displaced along the object's local surface using a single control law. In this paper, we extend this approach by allowing multiple control laws to be active simultaneously. Three control laws are combined by projecting the actions of subordinate control laws into other control law spaces. The resulting composite controller finds grasps that are more robust than the component primitives in isolation. Finally, we show how this approach may be used on hand/arm manipulation systems with arbitrary kinematics.},

In the absence of any other structure, these approaches must evaluate a large number of feasible control sequences as a function of object shape, object pose, and task. This paper explores a new approach to grasp synthesis that limits consideration to variations on a generalized localize-reach-grasp control policy. A new learning algorithm, known as schema structured learning, is used to learn which instantiations of the generalized policy are most likely to lead to a successful grasp in different problem contexts. Experiments are described where Dexter, a dexterous bimanual humanoid, learns to select appropriate grasp strategies for different objects as a function of object eccentricity and orientation. In addition, it is shown that grasp skills learned in this way generalize well to new objects. Results are presented showing that after learning how to grasp a small, representative set of objects, the robot's performance quantitatively improves for similar objects that it has not experienced before.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by ASME.The leg mechanism of the novel jumping robot, Salto, is designed to achieve multiple functions during the sub-200 ms time span that the leg interacts with the ground, including minimizing impulse loading, balancing angular momentum, and manipulating power output of the robot's series-elastic actuator. This is all accomplished passively with a single degree-of-freedom linkage that has a coupled, unintuitive design which was synthesized using the technique described in this paper. Power delivered through the mechanism is increased beyond the motor's limit by using variable mechanical advantage to modulate energy storage and release in a series-elastic actuator. This power modulating behavior may enable high amplitude, high frequency jumps. We aim to achieve all required behaviors with a linkage composed only of revolute joints, simplifying the robot's hardware but necessitating a complex design procedure since there are no pre-existing solutions. The synthesis procedure has two phases: (1) design exploration to initially compile linkage candidates, and (2) kinematic tuning to incorporate power modulating characteristics and ensure an impulse-limited, rotation-free jump motion. The final design is an eight-bar linkage with a stroke greater than half the robot's total height that produces a simulated maximum jump power 3.6 times greater than its motor's limit. A 0.27m tall prototype is shown to exhibit minimal pitch rotations during meter high test jumps.},

abstract = {This paper identifies the class of actuators called clutched elastic actuators (CEAs). CEAs use clutches to control the energy flow into springs. CEAs in exoskeletons, prostheses, legged robots, and robotic arms have shown the ability to reduce the energy consumption and motor requirements, such as peak torque and peak power. Because of those abilities, they are increasingly used in robotics. In this paper, we categorize existing CEA designs, identify trends in those designs, and provide a method to analyze their functionality. Based on a literature survey, current CEA designs are placed in nine categories, depending on their morphology. The main trend is that CEA designs are becoming more complex, meaning that the number of clutches and springs increases. We show with the introduced mathematical analysis that the functionality can be analyzed with a constraint matrix, a stiffness matrix, and multiplication of a clutch-dependent diagonal matrix with an oriented incidence matrix. This method eases the analysis of the functionality of CEAs. Furthermore, it can lead to new CEA designs in which the number of resulting stiffnesses grows exponentially with the number of springs and clutches.},

The robotic glove leverages soft material actuator technology to safely distribute forces along the length of the finger and provide active flexion and passive extension. These actuators consist of molded elastomeric bladders with anisotropic fiber reinforcements that produce specific bending, twisting, and extending trajectories upon fluid pressurization. In particular, we present a method for customizing a soft actuator to a wearer's biomechanics and demonstrate in a motion capture system that the ranges of motion (ROM) of the two are nearly equivalent. The active ROM of the glove is further evaluated using the Kapandji test.

abstract = {Soft fluidic actuators consisting of elastomeric matrices with embedded flexible materials are of particular interest to the robotics community because they are affordable and can be easily customized to a given application. However, the significant potential of such actuators is currently limited as their design has typically been based on intuition. In this paper, the principle of operation of these actuators is comprehensively analyzed and described through experimentally validated quasi-static analytical and finite-element method models for bending in free space and force generation when in contact with an object. This study provides a set of systematic design rules to help the robotics community create soft actuators by understanding how these vary their outputs as a function of input pressure for a number of geometrical parameters. Additionally, the proposed analytical model is implemented in a controller demonstrating its ability to convert pressure information to bending angle in real time. Such an understanding of soft multimaterial actuators will allow future design concepts to be rapidly iterated and their performance predicted, thus enabling new and innovative applications that produce more complex motions to be explored},

abstract = {Robotic applications often require robust tactile sensing capabilities on curved surfaces, such as artificial fingertips. Flexible tactile sensors could be conformally wrapped around curved digits and could enhance grip by cushioning impacts and increasing the effective contact area during grasp. Flexible microfabricated devices that use thin film or solid electrical components are susceptible to failure due to cracking and fatigue. Conductive fluids have been used as transduction media, electrical connections, and in resistance-based pressure and bend sensors. In this work, a flexible and multilayer capacitive microfluidic normal force sensor is developed with a 5 × 5 taxel array. The sensor uses liquid metal-filled microfluidic channels as the capacitive plates and conductive interconnects. The sensor is microfabricated using soft lithography microfabrication techniques and consists of multiple layers of PDMS microchannels filled with the liquid metal alloy Galinstan and air pockets that modify the mechanical and electrical properties of the sensor. A single taxel is calibrated for normal forces ranging from 0 to 2.5 N, is shown to provide repeatable measurements of static uniaxial loads, and follows the loading and unloading phases of low-frequency dynamic loads (0.4-4 Hz). The sensor prototype has a spatial resolution on the order of 0.5 mm, performs reliably when wrapped around a surface having a curvature similar to that of a human finger (1.575 cm-1), and has been shown to tolerate curvatures as high as 6.289 cm-1. The deformable liquid capacitive plates and heterogeneous PDMS-air dielectric medium can be designed to tune the sensor's sensitivity and range. The sensor prototype provides greater sensitivity at low loads, a feature which can be exploited for robotic applications in which light touch is important. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Conventional three-dimensional printing processes are material-dependent, and are irreversible. We present an alternative approach based on three-dimensional assembly of mass-produced two-dimensional components of digital material. This significantly enlarges the available material set, allows reversible disassembly, and imposes constraints that reduce the accumulation of local positioning errors in constructing a global shape. Experimental work on material properties and dimensional scaling of the digital material will be presented, with application in assembling functional structures. We propose that assembling digital material will be the future of 3 -dimensional free-form fabrication of functional materials. Most existing commercial free-form fabrication printers build by putting together small quantities of no more than a few expensive materials. In order to make high-resolution objects they need to be very precise and therefore cost between tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars and are operated by skilled technicians. On the other hand young children build 3-dimensional structures out of LEGO with their hands. LEGO structures are cheap, quick and easy to make, reversible and most importantly they are more precise than the kids who build them. However, they are big and are only made out of ABS plastic. We believe that digital materials bring reversibility, simplicity, low cost and speed to free form fabrication in addition to a larger material set. Previous research on structures built out of many discrete parts involved self assembly [1], error correction self assembly [2], programmable self-assembly [3] and folding[4]. We rely on a digital printer, as presented in [5] which will assemble the structure by picking and placing the bricks forming the digital material. We define a digital material as a discrete set of components that can be of any sizes and shape, made out of various materials and that can fit together in various ways (press fit, friction fit, snap fit, reflow binding, etc.). However the components of a digital material must satisfy the following properties which are familiar to many toy assembly kits:},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Many critical tasks in robotics, such as locomotion or manipulation, involve collisions between a rigid body and the environment or between multiple bodies. Methods based on sums-of-squares (SOS) for numerical computation of Lyapunov certificates are a powerful tool for analyzing the stability of continuous nonlinear systems, and can additionally be used to automatically synthesize stabilizing feedback controllers. Here, we present a method for applying sums-of-squares verification to rigid bodies with Coulomb friction undergoing discontinuous, inelastic impact events. The proposed algorithm explicitly generates Lyapunov certificates for stability, positive invariance, and safety over admissible (non-penetrating) states and contact forces. We leverage the complementarity formulation of contact, which naturally generates the semialgebraic constraints that define this admissible region. The approach is demonstrated on multiple robotics examples, including simple models of a walking robot, a perching aircraft, and control design of a balancing robot.},

abstract = {Within education, concepts such as distance learning, and open universities, are now becoming more widely used for teaching and learning. However, due to the nature of the subject domain, the teaching of Science, Technology, and Engineering are still relatively behind when using new technological approaches (particularly for online distance learning). The reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that these fields often require laboratory exercises to provide effective skill acquisition and hands-on experience. Often it is difficult to make these laboratories accessible for online access. Either the real lab needs to be enabled for remote access or it needs to be replicated as a fully software-based virtual lab. We argue for the latter concept since it offers some advantages over remotely controlled real labs, which will be elaborated further in this paper. We are now seeing new emerging technologies that can overcome some of the potential difficulties in this area. These include: computer graphics, augmented reality, computational dynamics, and virtual worlds. This paper summarizes the state of the art in virtual laboratories and virtual worlds in the fields of science, technology, and engineering. The main research activity in these fields is discussed but special emphasis is put on the field of robotics due to the maturity of this area within the virtual-education community. This is not a coincidence; starting from its widely multidisciplinary character, robotics is a perfect example where all the other fields of engineering and physics can contribute. Thus, the use of virtual labs for other scientific and non-robotic engineering uses can be seen to share many of the same learning processes. This can include supporting the introduction of new concepts as part of learning about science and technology, and introducing more general engineering knowledge, through to supporting more constructive (and collaborative) education and training activities in a more complex engineering topic such as robotics. The objective of this paper is to outline this problem space in more detail and to create a valuable source of information that can help to define the starting position for future research.},

abstract = {The variability of bird beak morphology reflects diverse foraging strategies. One such feeding mechanism in shorebirds involves surface tension-induced transport of prey in millimetric droplets: By repeatedly opening and closing its beak in a tweezering motion, the bird moves the drop from the tip of its beak to its mouth in a stepwise ratcheting fashion. We have analyzed the subtle physical mechanism responsible for drop transport and demonstrated experimentally that the beak geometry and the dynamics of tweezering may be tuned to optimize transport efficiency. We also highlight the critical dependence of the capillary ratchet on the beak's wetting properties, thus making clear the vulnerability of capillary feeders to surface pollutants.},

abstract = {Bipedal robots are difficult to analyze mathematically. However, successful control strategies can be discovered using simple physical intuition and can be described in simple terms. Five things have to happen for a planar bipedal robot to walk. Height has to be stabilized. Pitch has to be stabilized. Speed has to be stabilized. The swing leg has to move so that the feet are in locations which allow for the stability of height, pitch, and speed. Finally, transitions from support leg to support leg must occur at appropriate times. If these five objectives are achieved, the robot will walk. A number of different intuitive control strategies can be used to achieve each of these five objectives. Further, each strategy can be implemented in a variety of ways. We present several strategies for each objective which we have implemented on a bipedal walking robot. Using these simple intuitive strategies, we have compelled a seven link planar bipedal robot, called Spring Flamingo, to walk. The robot walks both slowly and quickly, walks over moderate obstacles, starts, and stops},

abstract = {1 Abstract We present velocity-based stability margins for fast bipedal walking that are sufficient conditions for stability, allow comparison between different walking algorithms, are measurable and computable, and are meaningful. While not completely necessary conditions, they are tighter necessary conditions than several previously proposed stability margins. The stability margins we present take into consideration a biped's Center of Mass position and velocity, the reachable region of its swing leg, the time required to swing its swing leg, and the amount of internal angular momentum available for capturing balance. They predict the opportunity for the biped to place its swing leg in such a way that it can continue walking without falling down. We present methods for estimating these stability margins by using simple models of walking such as an inverted pendulum model and the Linear Inverted Pendulum model. We show that by considering the Center of Mass location with respect to the Center of Pressure on the foot, these estimates are easily computable. Finally, we show through simulation experiments on a 12 degree-of-freedom distributed-mass lower-body biped that these estimates are useful for analyzing and controlling bipedal walking. 2 Introduction "How stable is your robot?" is a fundamental yet challenging question to answer, particularly with fast moving legged robots, such as dynamically balanced bipedal walkers. With many traditional control systems, questions of stability and robustness can be answered by eigenvalues, phase margins, loop gain margins, and other stability margins. However, legged robots are nonlin-ear, under-actuated, combine continuous and discrete dynamics, and do not necessarily have periodic motions. These features make applying traditional stability margins difficult.},

abstract = {Imbalance suggests a feeling of dynamism and movement in static objects. It is therefore not surprising that many 3D models stand in impossibly balanced configurations. As long as the models remain in a computer this is of no consequence: the laws of physics do not apply. However, fabrication through 3D printing breaks the illusion: printed models topple instead of standing as initially intended. We propose to assist users in producing novel, properly balanced designs by interactively deforming an existing model. We formulate balance optimization as an energy minimization, improving stability by modifying the volume of the object, while preserving its surface details. This takes place during interactive editing: the user cooperates with our optimizer towards the end result. We demonstrate our method on a variety of models. With our technique, users can produce fabricated objects that stand in one or more surprising poses without requiring glue or heavy pedestals. Copyright {\textcopyright} ACM 2013.},

Easily accomplished by humans, but very difficult to achieve for robots, grasping involves dealing with a high-dimensional space of parameters which include hand kinematics, object geometry, material properties and forces. We believe that the way a robot grasps an object should be motivated by the object's geometry and that the search space for stable grasps can be dramatically reduced if the underlying object representation reflects symmetry properties of the object that contain valuable information for grasp planning. In this paper, we introduce the grid of medial spheres, a volumetric object representation based on the medial axis transform. The grid of medial spheres represents arbitrarily shaped objects with arbitrary levels of detail and contains symmetry information that can be easily exploited by a grasp planning algorithm. We present the data structure as well as a grasp planning algorithm that exploits it and provide experimental results on various object models using two robot hands in simulation.},

abstract = {? 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.We study the detailed locomotor mechanics of a small, lightweight robot (DynaRoACH, 10 cm, 25 g) which can move on a granular substrate of closely packed 3 mm diameter glass particles at speeds up to 50 cm/s (5 body length/s), approaching the performance of small, highperforming, desert-dwelling lizards. To reveal how the robot achieves this high performance, we use high speed imaging to capture kinematics, and develop a numerical multi-body simulation of the robot coupled to an experimentally validated discrete element method (DEM) simulation of the granular media. Average forward speeds measured in both experiment and simulation agreed well, and increased non-linearly with stride frequency, reflecting a change in the mode of propulsion. At low frequencies, the robot used a quasi-static "rotary walking" mode, in which the granular material yielded as the legs penetrated and then solidified once vertical force balance was achieved. At high frequencies, duty factor decreased below 0.5 and aerial phases occurred. The propulsion mechanism was qualitatively different: the robot ran rapidly by utilizing the speed-dependent fluid-like inertial response of the material. We also used our simulation tool to vary substrate parameters that were inconvenient to vary in experiment (e.g., granular particle friction) to test performance and reveal limits of stability of the robot. Using small robots as physical models, our study reveals a mechanism by which small animals can achieve high performance on granular substrates, which in return advances the design and control of small robots in deformable terrains.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous objects are objects composed of different constituent materials. In these objects, multiple desirable properties from different constituent materials can be synthesized into one part. In order to obtain mass applications of such heterogeneous objects, efficient and effective design methodologies for heterogeneous objects are crucial. In this paper, we present a feature based design methodology to facilitate heterogeneous object design. Under this methodology, designers design heterogeneous objects using high-level design components that have engineering significance. These high level components are form features and material features. In this paper, we first examine the relationships between form features and material features in heterogeneous objects. We then propose three synthesized material features in accordance with our examination of these features. Based on these proposed features, we develop a feature based design methodology for heterogeneous objects. Two enabling methods for this design methodology, material heterogeneity specification within each feature and combination of these material features, are developed. A physics (diffusion) based B-spline method is developed to (1) allow design intent of material variation be explicitly captured by boundary conditions, (2) ensure smooth material variation across the feature volume. A novel method, direct face neighborhood alteration, is developed to increase the efficiency of combining heterogeneous material features. Examples of using this feature based design methodology for heterogeneous object design, such as a prosthesis design, are presented. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The application of robotic technology and computer control is one key to construction industry automation. Excavation automation is a multidisciplinary task, encompassing a broad area of research and development. The ultimate goal of the ACFR excavation project is to demonstrate fully autonomous execution of excavation tasks in common construction, such as loading a truck or digging a trench. A number of difficult theoretical and practical problems must be solved to achieve this objective. The problems fall into three main groups: excavation planning, sensing and estimation, and control},

Such robots will travel in outdoor terrain that is too steep, rutted, rocky, wet, muddy, and snowy for conventional vehicles. They will travel in cities and in our homes, doing chores and providing care, where steps, stairways and household clutter limit the utility of wheeled vehicles. Robots meeting these goals will have terrain sensors, sophisticated computing and power systems, advanced actuators and dynamic controls.

Assume The Robot Is A Sphere (ATRIAS) 2.1 is a new robot that has been designed for the study of 3D bipedal locomotion, with the aim of combining energy efficiency, speed, and robustness with respect to natural terrain variations in a single platform. The robot is highly underactuated, having 6 actuators and, in single support, 13 degrees of freedom. Its sagittal plane dynamics are designed to embody the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), which has been shown to provide a dynamic model of the body center of mass during steady running gaits of a wide diversity of terrestrial animals. A detailed dynamic model is used to optimize walking gaits with respect to the cost of mechanical transport (CMT), a dimensionless measure of energetic efficiency, for walking speeds ranging from 0.5 (m/s) to 1.4 (m/s). A feedback controller is designed that stabilizes the 3D walking gaits, despite the high degree of underactuation of the robot. The 3D results are illustrated in simulation. In experiments on a planarized (2D) version of the robot, the controller yielded stable walking.},

However, we know of only one study that analyzes student reactions when they are working with a computer tutor. This motivated us to study the behavior of students when they worked with a step-based physics tutoring system, Andes. As students solved problems on Andes, they gave talk-aloud protocols that were recorded along with their computer screen. Our main finding is that when students asked the tutoring system for help after getting minimal negative feedback, they tended to learn new knowledge or be reminded of something they knew already. On the other hand, if they responded to minimal negative feedback by trying again repeatedly and not asking for a hint, then they tended to fail both to learn and to correct the mistake.},

The manipulator is entirely composed of soft materials, and it has been designed to provide similar motion capabilities as the octopus's arm in order to reach the surgical target while exploiting its whole length to actively interact with the biological structures. The manipulator is composed of two identical modules (each of them can be controlled independently) with multi-directional bending and stiffening capabilities, like an octopus arm. In the authors' previous works, the design of the single module has been addressed. Here a two-module manipulator is presented, with the final aim of demonstrating the enhanced capabilities that such a structure can have in comparison with rigid surgical tools currently employed in MIS. The performances in terms of workspace, stiffening capabilities, and generated forces are characterized through experimental tests. The combination of stiffening capabilities and manipulation tasks is also addressed to confirm the manipulator potential employment in a real surgical scenario.},

abstract = {The mechanics of lift and thrust generation by flying animals are studied by considering the distribution of vorticity in the wake. As wake generation is not continuous, the momentum jet theory, which has previously been used, is not satisfactory, and the vortex theory is a more realistic model. The vorticity shed by the wings in the course of each powered stroke deforms into a small-cored vortex ring; the wake is a chain of such rings. The momentum of each ring sustains and propels the animal; induced power is calculated as the rate of increase of wake kinetic energy. A further advantage of the vortex theory is that lift and induced drag coefficients are not required; estimated instantaneous values of these coefficients are generally too large for steady state aerodynamic theory to be appropriate to natural flapping flight. The vortex theory is applied to hovering of insects and to avian forward flight. A simple expression for induced power in hovering is found. Induced power is always greater than simple momentum jet estimates, and the discrepancy becomes substantial as body mass increases. In hovering the wake is composed of a stack of horizontal, coaxial, circular vortex rings. In forward flight of birds the rings are elliptic; they are neither horizontal nor coaxial because the momentum of each ring balances the vector sum of parasite and profile drag and the bird's weight. Total power consumption as a function of flight velocity is calculated and compared for several species. Power reduction is one of the major factors influencing the choice of flight style. A large body of data is used to obtain an approximate scaling between stroke period and the body mass for birds. Together with relations between other morphological parameters, this is used to estimate the variation of flight speed and power with body mass for birds, and on this basis deviations from allometric scaling can be related to flight proficiency and to the use of such strategies as the bounding flight of small passerines.},

abstract = {We describe a randomized incremental algorithm for computing the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points and a recent technique of applying it to terrain generation. The algorithm is optimal, using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based location structure for the incremental insertion which achieves an expected running time of O(n log n) and O(n) expected storage. The analysis of the expected storage is simplified, and the algorithm is implemented and tested. The implementation is done, in its integrality, with CGAL-Python which is fast and friendly, followed by numerical statistics on different distributions. The terrain generation technique is based on gaussian functions and the plotting is made with the Open Source software Blender 3D which is probably its first combination with CGAL-Python. A high quality rendering of three simple terrains is shown as a demonstration of the terrain generator.

abstract = {In this work we detail a method that leverages the two color heads of recent low-end fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers to produce continuous tone imagery. The challenge behind producing such two-tone imagery is how to finely interleave the two colors while minimizing the switching between print heads, making each color printed span as long and continuous as possible to avoid artifacts associated with printing short segments. The key insight behind our work is that by applying small geometric offsets, tone can be varied without the need to switch color print heads within a single layer. We can now effectively print (two-tone) texture mapped models capturing both geometric and color information in our output 3D prints. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum {\textcopyright} 2014 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

In many cases they neglect to model the actuators or avoid a continuum approach. In particular, in the latter case this leads to a complex model hardly implemented. In this work, a geometrically exact steady-state model of a tendon-driven manipulator inspired by the octopus arm is presented. It takes a continuum approach, fast enough to be implemented in the control law, and includes a model of the actuation system. The model was experimentally validated and the results are reported. In conclusion, the model presented can be used as a tool for mechanical design of continuum tendon-driven manipulators, for planning control strategies or as internal model in an embedded system.},

abstract = {A common approach in designing legged robots is to build fully actuated machines and control the machine dynamics entirely in software, carefully avoiding impacts and expending a lot of energy. However, these machines are outperformed by their human and animal counterparts. Animals achieve their impressive agility, efficiency, and robustness through a close integration of passive dynamics, implemented through mechanical components, and neural control. Robots can benefit from this same integrated approach, but a strong theoretical framework is required to design the passive dynamics of a machine and exploit them for control. For this framework, we use a bipedal spring-mass model, which has been shown to approximate the dynamics of human locomotion. This paper reports the first implementation of spring-mass walking on a bipedal robot. We present the use of template dynamics as a control objective exploiting the engineered passive spring-mass dynamics of the ATRIAS robot. The results highlight the benefits of combining passive dynamics with dynamics-based control and open up a library of spring-mass model-based control strategies for dynamic gait control of robots.},

abstract = {Design is a complex engineering activity, in which computers are more and more involved. The design task can often be seen as an optimization problem in which the parameters or the structure describing the best quality design are sought. Genetic algorithms constitute a class of search algorithms especially suited to solving complex optimization problems. In addition to parameter optimization, genetic algorithms are also suggested for solving problems in creative design, such as combining components in a novel, creative way. Genetic algorithms transpose the notions of evolution in Nature to computers and imitate natural evolution. Basically, they find solution(s) to a problem by maintaining a population of possible solutions according to the ‘survival of the fittest' principle. We present here the main features of genetic algorithms and several ways in which they can solve difficult design problems. We briefly introduce the basic notions of genetic algorithms, namely, representation, genetic operators, fitness evaluation, and selection. We discuss several advanced genetic algorithms that have proved to be efficient in solving difficult design problems. We then give an overview of applications of genetic algorithms to different domains of engineering design.},

Over the past few decades, there has been considerable progress in developing new actuation technologies. However, controlled motion still represents a considerable bottleneck for many applications and hampers the development of advanced robots, especially at small length scales. Nature has solved this problem using molecular motors that, through living cells, are assembled into multiscale ensembles with integrated control systems. These systems can scale force production from piconewtons up to kilonewtons. By leveraging the performance of living cells and tissues and directly interfacing them with artificial components, it should be possible to exploit the intricacy and metabolic efficiency of biological actuation within artificial machines. We provide a survey of important advances in this biohybrid actuation paradigm.},

abstract = {Given the complexity of the problem, genetic algorithms are one of the more promising methods of discovering control schemes for soft robotics. Since physically embodied evolution is time consuming and expensive, an outstanding challenge lies in developing fast and suitably realistic simulations in which to evolve soft robot gaits. We describe two parallel methods of using NVidia's PhysX, a hardware-accelerated (GPGPU) physics engine, in order to evolve and optimize soft bodied gaits. The first method involves the evolution of open-loop gaits using a reduced-order lumped parameter model. The second method involves harnessing PhysX's soft-bodied material simulation capabilites. In each case we discuss the the challenges and possibilities involved in using the PhysX for evolutionary soft robotics.},

abstract = {Flying insects perform aerial maneuvers through slight
manipulations of their wing motions. Because such
manipulations in wing kinematics are subtle, a reliable method
is needed to properly discern consistent kinematic strategies
used by the insect from inconsistent variations and
measurement error. Here, we introduce a novel automated method
that accurately extracts full, 3D body and wing kinematics
from high-resolution films of free-flying insects. This method
combines visual hull reconstruction, principal components
analysis, and geometric information about the insect to
recover time series data of positions and orientations. The
technique has small, well-characterized errors of under 3
pixels for positions and 5 deg. for orientations. To show its
utility, we apply this motion tracking to the flight of fruit
flies, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that fruit flies
generate sideways forces during some maneuvers and that strong
lateral acceleration is associated with differences between
the left and right wing angles of attack. Remarkably, this
asymmetry can be induced by simply altering the relative
timing of flips between the right and left wings, and we
observe that fruit flies employ timing differences as high as
10% of a wing beat period while accelerating sideways at 40%

abstract = {A series of recent anatomical and functional data has radically changed our view on the organization of the motor cortex in primates. In the present article we present this view and discuss its fundamental principles. The basic principles are the following: (a) the motor cortex, defined as the agranular frontal cortex, is formed by a mosaic of separate areas, each of which contains an independent body movement representation, (b) each motor area plays a specific role in motor control, based on the specificity of its cortical afferents and descending projections, (c) in analogy to the motor cortex, the posterior parietal cortex is formed by a multiplicity of areas, each of which is involved in the analysis of particular aspects of sensory information. There are no such things as multipurpose areas for space or body schema and (d) the parieto-frontal connections form a series of segregated anatomical circuits devoted to specific sensorimotor transformations. These circuits transform sensory information into action. They represent the basic functional units of the motor system. Although these conclusions mostly derive from monkey experiments, anatomical and brain-imaging evidence suggest that the organization of human motor cortex is based on the same principles. Possible homologies between the motor cortices of humans and non-human primates are discussed.},

abstract = {The ability of birds to perch robustly and ef- fectively is a powerful demonstration of the capabilities of nature's control systems. Their apparent robustness to gust disturbances is particularly remarkable because when the airspeed approaches zero just before acquiring a perch, the influence of aerodynamic forces, and therefore potentially the control authority, is severely compromised. In this paper we present a simplified closed-form model for a fixed-wing aircraft which closely agrees with experimental indoor perching data. We then carefully examine the LTV controllability along an optimized perching trajectory for three different actuation scenarios - a glider (no powerplant), a fixed propeller, and a propeller with thrust vectoring. The results reveal that while all three vehicles are LTV controllable along the trajectory, the additional actuators allow the perch to be more easily acquired with less control surface deflections. However, in all three cases, disturbances experienced just before reaching the perch cannot be effectively rejected.},

We restrict ourselves to polyhedra, and give a set of geometric constraints tailored for matching components acquired
from haptic exploration against components in the models. We present a new constraint using pairs of line segments. We then give a set of active sensing moves, each with an associated cost measure, and our strategies for choosing the next move.},

abstract = {In this work, we develop a cooperative launching system for a 13.2 gram ornithopter micro-aerial vehicle (MAV), the H<sup>2</sup>Bird, by carrying it on the back of a 32 gram hexapedal millirobot, the VelociRoACH. We determine the necessary initial velocity and pitch angle for take off using force data collected in a wind tunnel and use the VelociRoACH to reach these initial conditions for successful launch. In the wind tunnel predicted success region, we were able to complete a successful launch for 75 percent of the 12 trials in that region. Although carrying the H<sup>2</sup>Bird on top of the VelociRoACH at a stride frequency of 17 Hz increases our average power consumption by about 24.5 percent over solo running, the H<sup>2</sup>Bird, in turn, provides stability advantages to the VelociRoACH. We observed that the variance in pitch and roll velocity with the H<sup>2</sup>Bird is about 90 percent less than without. Additionally, with the H<sup>2</sup>Bird flapping at 5 Hz during transport, we observed an increase of 12.7 percent of the steady state velocity. Lastly, we found that the costs of transport for carrying the H<sup>2</sup>Bird flapping and without (6.6 and 6.8) are lower than the solo costs of transport for the VelociRoACH and for the H<sup>2</sup>Bird (8.1 and 10.1).},

Previously we have presented this technology in application to sensing either force or a combination of point force and position. In this paper we now consider the application of this sensor to the sensing of object size. We propose a modification that enables sensing of the size on an incident object whilst retaining the previous sensing abilities. This is achieved by introducing a second deformable layer that may optionally have different compressive and/or optically transmission properties. We present results of sensing the size of different objects using this modified sensor and consider the simultaneous measurement of force, size and position. This triple-sensing action, along with the soft nature of the sensor medium, is especially important in applications where the sensing elements may be widely dispersed, for example in safe and compliant robot skin covering.},

abstract = {'Bottom-up fabrication', which exploits the intrinsic properties of atoms and molecules to direct their self-organization, is widely used to make relatively simple nanostructures. A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by 'top-down' methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide 'staple strands' to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).},

abstract = {With the integration of multiaxis layered manu- facturing and material removal (machining) pro- cesses, a hybrid system has more capability and flexibility to build complicated geometry with a single setup. Process planning to integrate the two different processes is a key issue. In this paper, an algorithm of adaptive slicing for a five-axis Laser Aided Manufacturing Process (LAMP) is summa- rized that can generate uniform and non-uniform thickness slices. A method to build a non-uniform (thickness) layer that utilizes two processes is pre- sented, and an overall algorithm for integration is described. The newly developed algorithm implemented in the process planning helps the hybrid system build parts more efficiently.},

Such a technique represents a promising approach to the design and fabrication of low cost and scalable articulated mechanisms provided with sensing capabilities and on-board actuation with potential applications in the field of minimally invasive surgery. Design and integration of soft components in the rigid-flex laminates is described along with the resulting soft pop-up mechanisms realized at different scales. Prototype characterization is presented, demonstrating forces and dexterity in a range suitable for surgical applications, as well as the possibility to integrate sensing capabilities. Based on these results, a multi-articulated robotic arm is fabricated and mounted on top of an endoscope model to provide a proof of concept of simple robotic mechanisms that could be useful in a surgical scenario.},

abstract = {Contemporary prostheses have developed from small iterations on moderately successful archetypes. This has resulted in modern designs that can either be termed cosmetic or functional, with neither attribute being fully satisfied. A new strategy is needed to develop a generation of upper-limb prostheses that will integrate both cosmetic and functional requirements in a single device. It is hypothesized that design principles applicable to a new generation of prostheses will result from exploring close analogies to the human upper limb. A method of practice led design research has been adopted to explore appropriate analogies, using the production of physical models to elucidate the design problem to the design team and other interested parties. This method uses a consciously iterative approach whereby criticisms and lessons learnt in the development of early models are embodied in subsequent models. This paper describes the first iterative cycle. It includes a critical review of the devices currently available and a study of mechanical analogies to original anatomy which form two of the inputs to the development of a skeletal model hand. It details the lessons learnt from this study and concludes on the wider application of practice led design research in medical engineering.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a soil penetration robotic system inspired by low friction penetration strategies in plant roots. Growth of cells at the root tip deforms soil, while sloughing cells in the cap create an interface between root and soil to reduce root-soil friction during penetration. A simple prototype, inspired by these root features and based on a tubular shaft and a soft continuum skin, was developed. The skin is kept inside the shaft and slips out and slides on its external body. This outward movement of the skin opens the soil in front of the tip and helps the system to penetrate. The skin covering the external body of shaft imitates the role of sloughing cells and provides low-friction interface between soil and shaft. Interaction between the external skin and soil gives to the system self-anchorage capabilities for the penetration. The performances of our robotic system were characterized during penetration in granular soils. The skin-soil interaction was found to be fundamental for 1) displacing the soil in front of the tip and 2) preventing backward movements of the robot by anchoring the posterior body to the soil. In order to exploit these effects some artificial hairs were added along the skin. The increased hair density (0.012 hairs/mm2) resulted in higher penetration depth of robot (about 30%).},

abstract = {We present the design, manufacturing, and characterization of a soft textile-based clutch (TBC) that uses vacuum stimulation to switch between locking and unlocking its linear displacement. The vacuum locks the relative sliding motion between two elaborated textile webbings with an elastic silicone rubber bag. Various fabrication techniques, such as silicone casting on textiles and melt embossing for direct fabrication of miniature patterns on textile and sewing, were used to develop three groups of TBC samples based on friction and interlocking principles. Their performance was compared in a blocking configuration. The clutch with an interlocking mechanism presented the highest withstanding force (150 N) compared to that (54 N) recorded for the friction-based clutch. The simple and compact structure of the proposed clutch, together with the intrinsic adaptability of fabric with other clothing and soft materials, make it an appropriate solution for applications in soft wearable robotics and generally as a locking and variable stiffness solution for soft robotic applications.},

abstract = {He number of women in science and engineering is growing, yet men continue to outnumber women, especially at the upper levels of these professions. In elementary, middle, and high school, girls and boys take math and science courses in roughly equal numbers, and about as many girls as boys leave high school prepared to pursue science and engineering majors in college. Yet fewer women than men pursue these majors. Among first-year college students, women are much less likely than men to say that they intend to major in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM). By graduation, men outnumber women in nearly every science and engineering field, and in some, such as physics, engineering, and computer science, the difference is dramatic, with women earning only 20 percent of bachelor's degrees. Women's representation in science and engineering declines further at the graduate level and yet again in the transition to the workplace. Drawing on a large and diverse body of research, this report presents eight recent research findings that provide evidence that social and environmental factors contribute to the under-representation of women in science and engineering.

We present results of both the kinematic and static analyses of the driving mechanism that essentially consists of three slider cranks in series. This analysis confirmed the force differential needed to propel the device. We then review various other microrobot technologies that have been developed including actuator design and fabrication, power and control electronics design, programming via a finite state machine, and the development of bioinspired fiber arrays. These technologies were then successfully integrated into the device. The robot is now functioning and we have already fabricated three iterations of the proposed device.

abstract = {This paper studies flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAV) whose transmission mechanisms use flexures as energy storage elements to reduce needed input power. A distinguishing feature of the proposed four-bar mechanism is the use of rubber-based flexures in two of its joints. These lightweight and compact flexures have been used for the first time in the design of an FWMAV whose projected total weight is approximately 3 g. This paper discusses in detail how the flexures were designed and how the challenges associated with their fabrication were met. Flexure stiffnesses were chosen based upon a simple, computationally efficient model of the four-bar mechanism actuated by an electric motor to flap two wings at 18 Hz. An instrumented test stand was designed to easily replace the upper part of the four-bar flexure mechanism and wings, and it was used to experimentally determine the power savings associated with flexures of different stiffnesses. While the measured power savings (maximum of 20%) may seem modest, they were nevertheless significant, considering that the use of the rubber-based flexures produced approximately 0.3 g added thrust at a less than 1% cost in weight (0.02 g).},

abstract = {  We are developing a process to quickly prototype millirobotic systems in which the approach is to identify and develop a construction kit for fabricating almost any design, similar to the kits that are available for larger-scale robots. Two of the basic elements of the kit, the links and flexure joints, have been identified, and an assembly method has been developed. This paper deals with the problem of integrating the wiring in these parts, a significant task on this size scale. This novel feature is achieved through the use of a flexible ribbon cable consisting of three wires made out of patterned copper foil and polyimide. Low melting point solder has been tested successfully to make the electrical interconnect between the parts. We discuss the issues that must be addressed in designing the flexure-wiring combination. In addition, the paper presents the methodology for fabricating structures with integrated wiring using a simple four bar mechanism as an example. Finally, the tests show that the wiring loop over a flexure connecting a distally located sensor on the mechanism maintains both its electrical and mechanical integrity even during large motions. Future work will include the automated assembly of the parts with a low cost assembly tool. },

abstract = {Traditionally, origami-based structures are designed on the premise of “rigid folding,” However, every act of folding and unfolding is accompanied by elastic deformations in real structures. This study focuses on these elastic deformations in order to expand ori- gami into a new method of designing morphing structures. The authors start by proposing a simple model for evaluating elastic deformation in nonrigid origami structures. Next, these methods are applied to deployable plate models. Initial strain is introduced into the elastic parts as actuators for deployment. Finally, by using the finite element method (FEM), it is confirmed that the proposed system can accomplish the complete deployment in 3?3 Miura-or model.},

abstract = {Ladybird beetles are high-mobility insects and explore broad areas by switching between walking and flying. Their excellent wing transformation systems enabling this lifestyle are expected to provide large potential for engineering applications. However, the mechanism behind the folding of their hindwings remains unclear. The reason is that ladybird beetles close the elytra ahead of wing folding, preventing the observation of detailed processes occurring under the elytra. In the present study, artificial transparent elytra were transplanted on living ladybird beetles, thereby enabling us to observe the detailed wing-folding processes. The result revealed that in addition to the abdominal movements mentioned in previous studies, the edge and ventral surface of the elytra, as well as characteristic shaped veins, play important roles in wing folding. The structures of the wing frames enabling this folding process and detailed 3D shape of the hindwing were investigated using microcomputed tomography. The results showed that the tape spring-like elastic frame plays an important role in the wing transformation mechanism. Compared with other beetles, hindwings in ladybird beetles are characterized by two seemingly incompatible properties: (i) the wing rigidity with relatively thick veins and (ii) the compactness in stored shapes with complex crease patterns. The detailed wing-folding process revealed in this study is expected to facilitate understanding of the naturally optimized system in this excellent deployable structure.},

From a design point of view, feature-based design offers possibilities for supporting the design process better than current CAD systems do. The evolution of feature definitions is briefly discussed. Features and their role in the design process and as representatives of design-objects and design-object knowledge are discussed. The main research issues related to feature-based design are outlined. These are: feature representation, features and tolerances, feature validation, multiple viewpoints towards features, features and standardization, and features and languages. An overview of some academic feature-based design systems is provided. Future research issues in feature-based design are outlined. The conclusion is that feature-based design is still in its infancy, and that more research is needed for a better support of the design process and better integration with manufacturing, although major advances have already been made. ?? 1993.},

To obtain the best material features, an optimization problem is constructed based on the object's functional requirements.

abstract = {This paper reports the applicability of our passivity-based contact force control framework for biped humanoids. We experimentally demonstrate its adaptation to unknown rough terrain. Adaptation to uneven ground is achieved by optimally distributed antigravitational forces applied to preset contact points in a feedforward manner, even without explicitly measuring the external forces or the terrain shape. Adaptation to unknown inclination is also possible by combining an active balancing controller based on the center-of-mass (CoM) measurements with respect to the inertial frame. Furthermore, we show that a simple impedance controller for supporting the feet or hands allows the robot to adapt to low-friction ground without prior knowledge of the ground friction. This presentation includes supplementary experimental videos that show a full-sized biped humanoid robot balancing on uneven ground or time-varying inclination.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that monkeys and humans can use signals from the brain to guide computer cursors. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or approximately 15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans.},

We present the empirically derived limit surface for directional adhesive pads and illustrate its application to controlling the forces at the feet of a robot climbing on arbitrary slopes, including overhanging surfaces. For the directional adhesive patches that we have developed, the limit surface is convex, which permits efficient computation of the desired internal and external forces among the feet to maximize a safety margin with respect to disturbance forces on the robot. The limit surface also intersects the origin in force space, which enables efficient climbing without wasting energy in attaching and detaching the feet. These insights are applied to an experimental climbing platform demonstrating the proper use of directional adhesion and mimicking the climbing behavior seen in geckos.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design of a fast long-jumping robot conceived to move in unstructured environments through simple feed-forward control laws. Despite the apparent similarities with hopping, jumping dynamics is peculiar and involve non-trivial issues on actuation powering, energy saving and stability. The "Grillo" robot described here is a quadruped, 50-mm robot that weights about 15 grams and is suited for a long-jumping gait. Inspired by frog locomotion, a tiny motor load the springs connected to the hind limbs. At take-off, an escapement mechanism releases the loaded springs. This provides a peak power output that can exceed several times the maximum motor power. In this way, the actuation and energy systems can be significantly reduced in weight and size. On the other hand, passive dynamics is exploited by compliant forelegs, that let to partially recover the impact energy in their elastic recoil. Equipped with a 0.2W DC motor, the robot is dimensioned to achieve a forward speed of 1.5 m/s, which corresponds to about 30 body length per second.},

Engineers can study scaling effects in animal locomotion in order to determine the optimal gait for a given-size robot. In this paper the design of a miniature jumping robot is presented. Inspired by small jumping animals, the robot performs catapult jumps, using an elastic energy storage and a release mechanism. Compliant forelegs are completely passive, and cushion the landing re-using part of the impact energy. The influence of compliance and elastic energy storage on performances is discussed. Spring stiffness and elongation are dimensioned according to design limitations and energy constraints, avoiding early loss of ground contact, i.e. take-off before complete leg extension. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Several solutions are provided for the problem of a single spherical robot finger exploring a known smooth surface, starting with an unknown pose. Using pose estimates, pattern matching is performed between the robot's internal model of the surface and the known model. The robot finger is guided to explore regions of the surface that will maximize the probability of recognition. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of one algorithm. In addition, it is shown that haptic exploration and dexterous manipulation can be achieved concurrently when multiple robot fingers are used.},

abstract = {The influence of ankle compliance on bipedal robot locomotion is investigated in this paper. The focus is on reduction of energy consumption. The concept of hybrid zero dynamics is adapted to design walking gaits with three phases: underactuated heel roll, full actuation and underactuated toe roll. Ankle springs work in parallel with the ankle actuators. Stiffness and offset of the linear torsional springs at the ankle and gait parameters are optimized simultaneously. It is shown that simultaneous optimization of spring properties and gait is superior to optimizing the spring after the gait. Optimal spring stiffness and offset lead to a major reduction in energy consumption. Furthermore, a more human-like gait is observed for simultaneous optimization of gait and spring parameters compared to gait optimization with zero stiffness.},

abstract = {Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.},

The structural mechanics of these metamaterials are dominated by the kinematics of the folding, which only depends on the geometry and therefore is scale-independent. First, a folded shell structure is introduced, where the fold pattern provides a negative Poisson's ratio for in-plane deformations and a positive Poisson's ratio for out-of-plane bending. Second, a cellular metamaterial is described based on a stacking of individual folded layers, where the folding kinematics are compatible between layers. Additional freedom in the design of the metamaterial can be achieved by varying the fold pattern within each layer.},

In this paper we explore the intriguing mechanical properties of Folded Textured Sheets, by way of two examples. The fold patterns allow the sheets to undergo large deformations, as well as change their global Gaussian curvature without stretching the material. Furthermore, both example sheets share the remarkable property that their Poisson's ratio under bending is of opposite sign to that under extension. The properties of the sheets were studied using a simple numerical model, where the folded sheets are represented by a pin-jointed framework; this captures the key deformation modes.},

This new actuator prototype (VSA-II) is developed as an improvement over our previously developed one reported in [9], where an optimal mechanical-control codesign principle established in [7] is followed as well. While the first version was built in a way to demonstrate effectiveness of Variable Impedance Actuation (VIA), it had limitations in torque capacities, life cycle and implementability in a real robot. VSA-II overcomes the problem of implementability with higher capacities and robustness in design for longer life. The paper discusses design and stiffness behaviour of VSA-II in theory and experiments. A comparison of stiffness characteristics between the two actuator is discussed, highlighting the advantages of the new design. A simple, but effective PD scheme is employed to independently control joint-stiffness and joint-position of a 1-link arm. Finally, results from performed impact tests of 1-link arm are reported, showing the effectiveness of stiffness variation in controlling value of a safety metric. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Nine cases of relatively selective hand weakness produced by stroke were analyzed to examine the degree to which representations of different fingers are segregated in the human primary motor cortex (M1). In five cases, all the digits were involved uniformly; in four cases the radial versus ulnar digits of the hand were involved differentially. No patient showed discrete involvement of a single digit, nor did any patient have greatest weakness in the index, middle or ring finger. These findings provide little evidence that each digit is represented in a separate cortical territory, but rather suggest that broadly overlapping gradients - with the radial digits somewhat more heavily represented laterally and the ulnar digits somewhat more heavily represented medially - are superimposed on an underlying organization in which control of each finger is distributed widely throughout the human M1 hand area.},

abstract = {Since the 1870s, the primary motor cortex (M1) has been known to have a somatotopic organization, with different regions of cortex participating in control of face, arm, and leg movements. Through the middle of the 20th century, it seemed possible that the principle of somatotopic organization extended to the detailed representation of different body parts within each of the three major representations. The arm region of M1, for example, was thought to contain a well-ordered, point-to-point representation of the movements or muscles of the thumb, index, middle, ring, and little fingers, the wrist, elbow, and shoulder, as conveyed by the iconic homunculus and simiusculus. In the last quarter of the 20th century, however, experimental evidence has accumulated indicating that within-limb somatotopy in M1 is not spatially discrete nor sequentially ordered. Rather, beneath gradual somatotopic gradients of representation, the representations of different smaller body parts or muscles each are distributed widely within the face, arm, or leg representation, such that the representations of any two smaller parts overlap extensively. Appreciation of this underlying organization will be essential to further understanding of the contribution to control of movement made by M1. Because no single experiment disproves a well-ordered within-limb somatotopic organization in M1, here I review the accumulated evidence, using a framework of six major features that constrain the somatotopic organization of M1: convergence of output, divergence of output, horizontal interconnections, distributed activation, effects of lesions, and ability to reorganize. Review of the classic experiments that led to development of the homunculus and simiusculus shows that these data too were consistent with distributed within-limb somatotopy. I conclude with speculations on what the constrained somatotopy of M1 might tell us about its contribution to control of movement.},

abstract = {The primary motor cortex (M1) is thought to control movements of different body parts from somatotopically organized cortical territories. Electrical stimulation suggests, however, that territories controlling different fingers overlap. Such overlap might be artifactual or else might indicate that activation of M1 to produce a finger movement occurs over a more widespread cortical area than usually assumed. These possibilities were distinguished in monkeys moving different fingers. Recordings showed that single M1 neurons were active with movements of different fingers. Neuronal populations active with movements of different fingers overlapped extensively. Control of any finger movement thus appears to utilize a population of neurons distributed throughout the M1 hand area rather than a somatotopically segregated population.},

The latter keeps contact forces as small as possible while considering friction limits at the contact points during (re)grasping.

abstract = {This paper aims to democratize the design and fabrication of robots, enabling people of all skill levels to make robots without needing expert domain knowledge. Existing work in computational design and rapid fabrication has explored this question of customization for physical objects but so far has not been able to conquer the complexity of robot designs. We have developed Interactive Robogami, a tool for composition-based design of ground robots that can be fabricated as flat sheets and then folded into 3D structures. This rapid prototyping process enables users to create lightweight, affordable, and materially versatile robots with short turnaround time. Using Interactive Robogami, designers can compose new robot designs from a database of print-and-fold parts. The designs are tested for the users' functional specifications via simulation and fabricated on user satisfaction. We present six robots designed and fabricated using a 3D printing based approach, as well as a larger robot cut from sheet metal. We have also conducted a user study that demonstrates that our tool is intuitive for novice designers and expressive enough to create a wide variety of ground robot designs.},

abstract = {A fused filament fabrication printer has a fixed extrusion module having multiple printheads having print tips. The fixed arrangement of the printing heads allows the close spacing of multiple print tips in a printhead unit, and the simple routing of multiple plastic or metal filaments to the individual printing heads. The closely spaced print tips in the printhead unit share common components. An exemplary printhead unit has four printing heads which share a common heating block and heating block temperature sensor. The heating block incorporates a group of four print tips evenly spaced along a line. Each printing head has a separate filament which is controlled and driven by its own stepper motor through the heating block to one of the print tips. Printing of a part is by control of individual stepper motors which drive filaments through the heating block and through one of the printing tips.},

To maximise the chance of success the design must be performed with consideration of the likely target environment. Current knowledge on building collapse debris fields suggest that robots must be able to move through and underneath debris utilizing void spaces. Due to the likely chance of void spaces being partially blocked, an USAR robot should have manipulation capability, a very under-explored area of USAR robotics. The moving of debris can be likened to the digging action of some animals such as the European mole.

abstract = {This paper presents a generalization of non-uniform B-spline surfaces called T-splines. T-spline control grids permit T-junctions, so lines of control points need not traverse the entire control grid. T-splines support many valuable operations within a consistent framework, such as local refinement, and the merging of several B-spline surfaces that have different knot vectors into a single gap-free model. The paper focuses on T-splines of degree three, which are C2 (in the absence of multiple knots). T-NURCCs (Non-Uniform Rational Catmull-Clark Surfaces with T-junctions) are a superset of both T-splines and Catmull-Clark surfaces. Thus, a modeling program for T-NURCCs can handle any NURBS or Catmull-Clark model as special cases. T-NURCCs enable true local refinement of a Catmull-Clark-type control grid: individual control points can be inserted only where they are needed to provide additional control, or to create a smoother tessellation, and such insertions do not alter the limit surface. T-NURCCs use stationary refinement rules and are C2 except at extraordinary points and features.},

With decreasing robot size, different issues for climbing mechanisms and their attachment and detachment appear due to the physics of scaling. This paper describes micro-scale phenomena for different adhesion methods that can be employed in microrobots. These adhesion methods are applied to a sub-2 gram legged robot, the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot (HAMR), by leveraging recent advances in milli- and micrometer-scale manufacturing. The presented designs utilize different passively oriented adhesives on the legs of the robot to improve inclined locomotion performance. A 3DoF ankle joint is designed and implemented and the effects of a passive tail are studied. As a result, HAMR's climbing capability is increased from 3° inclines to 22° inclines and 45° declines. Finally, an analytical model of leg and foot force generation is presented and compared with experimental force data from the attachment mechanism on a single-leg experimental setup.},

Legged robots can explore unstructured environments more effectively than wheeled robots, but high turning rate tracking is still a challenging problem, particularly on varying surfaces. Previous steering methods with small robots have shown high turn rates, but usually only on a limited set of surfaces. This paper proposes a new method for steering a miniaturized legged robot by cooperation between two robots connected by a compliant joint, creating a 73 gram, 12 legged robot. Detailed design issues and an empirical verification are presented for several cooperation strategies, including changing velocities of the 4 sets of leg triples. The robots use their combined traction forces to turn at better than 50 degrees/sec at 1 m/sec on various surfaces. Closed-loop steering using a differential drive strategy is implemented on the connected robots to track a 'figure 8' trajectory on a tile surface.},

abstract = {This paper presents the complete development and analysis of a soft robotic platform that exhibits peristaltic locomotion. The design principle is based on the antagonistic arrangement of circular and longitudinal muscle groups of Oligochaetes. Sequential antagonistic motion is achieved in a flexible braided mesh-tube structure using a nickel titanium (NiTi) coil actuators wrapped in a spiral pattern around the circumference. An enhanced theoretical model of the NiTi coil spring describes the combination of martensite deformation and spring elasticity as a function of geometry. A numerical model of the mesh structures reveals how peristaltic actuation induces robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction of circumferential NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled, tested, and compared on the basis of speed. Utilizing additional NiTi coils placed longitudinally, steering capabilities are incorporated. Proprioceptive potentiometers sense segment contraction, which enables the development of closed-loop controllers. Several appropriate control algorithms are designed and experimentally compared based on locomotion speed and energy consumption. The entire mechanical structure is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand significant external impact during operation. This approach allows a completely soft robotic platform by employing a flexible control unit and energy sources.},

abstract = {Fossil bird skeletons discovered in Lower Cretaceous lake deposits in China shed new light on the early evolution of avian flight and perching. The 135 million-year-old sparrow-sized skeletons represent a new avian, Sinornis santensis, n. gen. n. sp., that preserves striking primitive features such as a flexible manus with unguals, a footed pubis, and stomach ribs (gastralia). In contrast to Archaeoperyx, however, Sinornis exhibits advanced features such as a broad sternum, wing-folding mechanism, pygostyle, and large fully reversed hallux. Modern avian flight function and perching capability, therefore, must have evolved in small-bodied birds in inland habitats not long after Archaeopteryx.},

abstract = {Several physico-mechanical designs evolved in fish are currently inspiring robotic devices for propulsion and maneuvering purposes in underwater vehicles. Considering the potential benefits involved, this paper presents an overview of the swimming mechanisms employed by fish. The motivation is to provide a relevant and useful introduction to the existing literature for engineers with an interest in the emerging area of aquatic biomechanisms. The fish swimming types are presented, following the well-established classification scheme and nomenclature originally proposed by Breder. Fish swim either by body and/or caudal fin (BCF) movements or using median and/or paired fin (MPF) propulsion. The latter is generally employed at slow speeds, offering greater maneuverability and better propulsive efficiency, while BCF movements can achieve greater thrust and accelerations. For both BCF and MPF locomotion, specific swimming modes are identified, based on the propulsor and the type of movements (oscillatory or undulatory) employed for thrust generation. Along with general descriptions and kinematic data, the analytical approaches developed to study each swimming mode are also introduced. Particular reference is made to lunate tail propulsion, undulating fins, and labriform (oscillatory pectoral fin) swimming mechanisms, identified as having the greatest potential for exploitation in artificial systems.},

abstract = {This article presents the development of a multiple robotic fish cooperation platform, which is established by employing a group of radio-controlled, multi-link fish-like robots. This work is inspired by the observation from nature that the capability of one single fish is limited, as in order to survive the atrocious circumstances in the sea, fish often swim in schools. The analogical situations occur in the robotic fish case. In engineering applications, most missions are so complex that they must be accomplished by effective cooperation of multiple fish robots. The platform presented in this article, as a novel test bed for multiple robotic fish cooperation, can be applied to different types of complex tasks. More importantly, it provides a good platform to test and verify all kinds of algorithms and strategies for cooperation of multiple underwater mobile robots. We use two cooperative tasks as examples to heuristically demonstrate the performance of this platform.

abstract = {The direct-forcing fictitious domain method is extended to simulate the locomotion of a passively pitching foil. Our study focuses on the hysteresis phenomenon that the critical frequency for the reverse of the locomotion direction of the wing in case of decreasing frequency is smaller than that in case of increasing frequency. In our simulations, the hysteresis phenomenon is produced by imposing different initial conditions at a same frequency. Our results indicate that the ratio of the heaving amplitudes of two foil edges is crucial to the direction of the foil's horizontal motion, and the amplitude of the leading edge is generally smaller. The critical frequencies for the reverse of the locomotion direction are increased, when the foil-fluid density ratio is decreased or the spring constant is increased. The critical frequencies in the bi-stability regime also depend on the initial velocity imposed, and the hysteresis loop generally becomes larger if the initial velocities are closer to the terminal locomotion velocities of the foil.},

abstract = {This article explores a technique to leverage curved surfaces for producing preferential buckling that can be used to create forward thrust in flapping-wing devices. We present a novel concept for using anisotropically buckling beams in robot locomotion, facilitated via an analytical and finite-element-based analyses. We demonstrate that with symmetric flapping inputs from a motor, buckling beams can be used to generate forward thrust, power, and work while reducing the drag associated with the recovery phase of the flapping gait. Our analysis includes experimental data that measures the forces produced by wings flapping in air and water. The results show a clear difference in the work produced between buckling and nonbuckling curved beams and shows that the average force and work produced by buckling wings over a number of cycles with symmetric flapping is nonzero. This has been demonstrated on a new, two-fin swimming robot that, through the use of this phenomenon, is capable of reaching an average speed of 0.1 m/s. This article makes it possible for simple motor inputs to produce complex swimming gaits through careful consideration during the mechanical design phase for swimming robots.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates how laminated techniques may be used to replicate the performance of more traditionally manufactured robotic manipulators. In this case study, we introduce a laminated 2-DOF spherical, parallel manipulator. Taking advantage of laminating techniques in the construction of the robot can result in considerable saving in construction costs and time, but, the challenges caused by this technique have to be addressed. By using stiffer materials in rigid links, the rigidity of the robot is increased to an acceptable level. We discuss one method for compensating position uncertainty via an experimental identification technique which uses a neural network to create a forward kinematic model. Final results show that the proposed mechanism is able to track desired rotation with acceptable precision using open-loop model-based control. This indicates that parallel manipulators fabricated using lamination techniques can provide similar performance with prototypes made in conventional methods.},

abstract = {Multibody software designed for mechanical engineering has been successfully employed in biomedical research for many years. For real time operation some biomedical researchers have also adapted game physics engines. However, these tools were built for other purposes and do not fully address the needs of biomedical researchers using them to analyze the dynamics of biological structures and make clinically meaningful recommendations. We are addressing this problem through the development of an open source, extensible, high performance toolkit including a multibody mechanics library aimed at the needs of biomedical researchers. The resulting code, Simbody, supports research in a variety of fields including neuromuscular, prosthetic, and biomolecular simulation, and related research such as biologically-inspired design and control of humanoid robots and avatars. Simbody is the dynamics engine behind OpenSim, a widely used biomechanics simulation application. This article reviews issues that arise uniquely in biomedical research, and reports on the architecture, theory, and computational methods Simbody uses to address them. By addressing these needs explicitly Simbody provides a better match to the needs of researchers than can be obtained by adaptation of mechanical engineering or gaming codes. Simbody is a community resource, free for any purpose.

Combination of the GO nanosheets and thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) polymeric networks provides the hydrogels with an excellent NIR light-responsive property. The ultrahigh tensibility of PNIPAM-GO nanocomposite hydrogels is achieved by simply using a very low concentration of N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS) molecules as chemical cross-linkers to generate a relatively homogeneous structure with flexible long polymer chains and rare chemically cross-linked dense clusters. Moreover, the oxidized groups of GO nanosheets enable the formation of a hydrogen bond interaction with the amide groups of PNIPAM chains, which could physically cross-link the PNIPAM chains to increase the toughness of the hydrogel networks. The prepared PNIPAM-GO nanocomposite hydrogels with ultrahigh tensibility exhibit rapid, reversible, and repeatable NIR light-responsive properties, which are highly promising for fabricating remote light-controlled devices, smart actuators, artificial muscles, and so on.},

In particular, self-folding of two-dimensional materials using shape memory polymers and embedded electrical circuits has been utilized to build robots and structures in an inexpensive and rapid manner. In order to build increasingly complex and functional self-folding machines, however, methods for interaction with the environment are necessary. This paper presents and characterizes three types of self-folding sensors: a mechanical switch, a capacitive contact sensor, and a velocity sensor. We utilize specialized fold patterns to create cyclic mechanical linkages as well as additional composite layers such as magnetic sheets to build these sensors. We demonstrate the integration of two of these sensors, the switch and the contact sensor, into a lamp that can self-fold and immediately begin responding to its surroundings.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. To create life-like movements, living muscle actuator technologies have borrowed inspiration from biomimetic concepts in developing bioinspired robots. Here, the development of a bioinspired soft robotics system, with integrated self-actuating cardiac muscles on a hierarchically structured scaffold with flexible gold microelectrodes is reported. Inspired by the movement of living organisms, a batoid-fish-shaped substrate is designed and reported, which is composed of two micropatterned hydrogel layers. The first layer is a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel substrate, which provides a mechanically stable structure for the robot, followed by a layer of gelatin methacryloyl embedded with carbon nanotubes, which serves as a cell culture substrate, to create the actuation component for the soft body robot. In addition, flexible Au microelectrodes are embedded into the biomimetic scaffold, which not only enhance the mechanical integrity of the device, but also increase its electrical conductivity. After culturing and maturation of cardiomyocytes on the biomimetic scaffold, they show excellent myofiber organization and provide self-actuating motions aligned with the direction of the contractile force of the cells. The Au microelectrodes placed below the cell layer further provide localized electrical stimulation and control of the beating behavior of the bioinspired soft robot.},

abstract = {A motion planning algorithm is described for bounding over rough terrain with the LittleDog robot. Unlike walking gaits, bounding is highly dynamic and cannot be planned with quasi-steady approximations. LittleDog is modeled as a planar five-link system, with a 16-dimensional state space; computing a plan over rough terrain in this high-dimensional state space that respects the kinodynamic constraints due to underactuation and motor limits is extremely challenging. Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are known for fast kinematic path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces in the presence of obstacles, but search efficiency degrades rapidly with the addition of challenging dynamics. A computationally tractable planner for bounding was developed by modifying the RRT algorithm by using: (1) motion primitives to reduce the dimensionality of the problem; (2) Reachability Guidance, which dynamically changes the sampling distribution and distance metric to address differential constraints and discontinuous motion primitive dynamics; and (3) sampling with a Voronoi bias in a lower-dimensional “task space” for bounding. Short trajectories were demonstrated to work on the robot, however open-loop bounding is inherently unstable. A feedback controller based on transverse linearization was implemented, and shown in simulation to stabilize perturbations in the presence of noise and time delays.},

Working with the Miura-ori tessellation, we find that each unit cell of this crease pattern is mechanically bistable, and by switching between states, the compressive modulus of the overall structure can be rationally and reversibly tuned. By virtue of their interactions, these mechanically stable lattice defects also lead to emergent crystallographic structures such as vacancies, dislocations, and grain boundaries. Each of these structures comes from an arrangement of reversible folds, highlighting a connection between mechanical metamaterials and programmable matter. Given origami's scale-free geometric character, this framework for metamaterial design can be directly transferred to milli-, micro-, and nanometer-size systems.},

@phdthesis{Singh1995a,
abstract = {This thesis describes an approach to synthesizing plans for robotic excavators. Excava- tion tasks range from loading a pile of soil to cutting a geometrically described volume of earth— for a trench or foundation footing. The excavation task can be stated in terms famil- iar to researchers in robotics and artificial intelligence: Transform the world from its current state to another state. Two important characteristics, however, distinguish the excavation domain. First, soil is deformable, and, hence, a complete state-space description of terrain to be excavated requires a high-dimensional representation. But, for the state-based represen- tations that traditional planners use, very large spaces are simply infeasible. Second, the response of soil varies immensely, and in general, it is not possible to analytically describe the mechanics of soil motion and its interaction with tools. A soil's shear strength depends not only on its physical and chemical makeup, but also on factors such as the compaction experienced in the past. Thus a robotic excavator is forced to deal with approximate and incomplete models of its actions and their results. This research has developed and demonstrated a unified approach to deal with each of these issues. Instead of posing the planning problem in state space, this thesis employs a dual representation called “action space.” An action space is spanned by parameters that abstract the actions that a robot excavator might perform. This formulation allows posing an excavation task as a problem of constrained optimization over the space of prototypical, one- step excavating plans. To reason about resistive forces encountered while digging, this work has developed a method that learns to predict resistive forces encountered during excava- tion. The action space representation allows incorporating goal configuration and geometric and force constraints within a single framework. Planning is thus reduced to finding a sub- set of plans that meet the constraints and optimize an appropriate performance measure. Over 400 experiments were conducted on a specially-developed testbed to validate the action-space/force-prediction approach. The testbed robot has a hydraulically manipulated shovel and sensors that measure both contact forces and terrain contour. Given a geometric specification, the current implementation can excavate a trench to predictable tolerances. Testbed results reinforce the notion that a force-based model is essential to successful robotic excavation. These findings also point to the necessity of a lower-level control mode that can modify excavation plans based on the nature of the terrain encountered.},

Secondly, the absolute difference is calculated between the consecutive frames and the difference image is stored in the system. Thirdly, the difference image is converted into gray image and then translated into binary image. Finally, morphological filtering is done to remove noise.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design of a novel robot capable of climbing on vertical and rough surfaces, such as stucco walls. Termed CLIBO (claw inspired robot), the robot can remain in position for a long period of time. Such a capability offers important civilian and military advantages such as surveillance, observation, search and rescue and even for entertainment and games. The robot's kinematics and motion, is a combination between mimicking a technique commonly used in rock climbing using four limbs to climb and a method used by cats to climb on trees with their claws. It uses four legs, each with four-degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF) and specially designed claws attached to each leg that enable it to maneuver itself up the wall and to move in any direction. At the tip of each leg is a gripping device made of 12 fishing hooks and aligned in such a way that each hook can move independently on the wall's surface. This design has the advantage of not requiring a tail-like structure that would press against the surface to balance its weight. A locomotion algorithm was developed to provide the robot with an autonomous capability for climbing along the pre-designed route. The algorithm takes into account the kinematics of the robot and the contact forces applied on the foot pads. In addition, the design provides the robot with the ability to review its gripping strength in order to achieve and maintain a high degree of reliability in its attachment to the wall. An experimental robot was built to validate the model and its motion algorithm. Experiments demonstrate the high reliability of the special gripping device and the efficiency of the motion planning algorithm. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. An account is given of the muscular anatomy of the foot and ampulla of Asterias rubens. An intrinsic musculature of the sucker figured by Cu{\'{e}}not (1891) and Chadwick (1923) is shown not to be present; on the other hand, postural muscles responsible for orientating the podium, levator fibres which ‘cup' the sucker, and radial fibres which flatten it are described and figured for the first time. 2. The role of the different muscle systems, the collagen connective tissue, and the fluid of the hydrocoel in protracting and retracting the foot, and in effecting the attachment and detachment of the sucker, is discussed. 3. Evidence is presented, to show that postural pointing of the foot is brought about by the contraction of a ring of muscles encircling the base of the podium. The orienting muscles are functionally, but not anatomically, distinct from the longitudinal fibres of the retractor sheath. 4. The ambulatory step is shown to comprise a series of linked phases of static posture and of movement. Each phase is characterized by the contraction of one member of each of the two opposing pairs of muscles engaged in the development of the step. The two pairs of muscles are (1) the anterior and posterior orienting fibres, and (2) the protractors and retractors of the foot. In its ideal form the step comprises four phases of static posture alternating with four movements. Each movement is ushered in by a reversal of the contraction-relaxation relationships of one of the two pairs of opposing muscle systems. Four such changes are possible and they occur in a sequence that ensures the orderly succession of the four movements of protraction, swing back, retraction, and swing forward, of which movements the idealized stepping cycle is composed. 5. The actual locomotory step departs from the ideal form in two respects: (1) it is liable to become disrupted by a delay in the initiation of the protraction or of the backswing movement, and (2) withdrawal of the podium occurs simultaneously with its re-orientation in the forward direction. It is pointed out that these variations are explicable on the assumption that, in the two series of opposing muscle pairs, the retractor fibres are more readily excited to contract than are their antagonists, and the anterior postural muscles than the posterior postural fibres.},

abstract = {Skin-like sensitivity, or the capability to recognize tactile information, will be an essential feature of future generations of robots, enabling them to operate in unstructured environments. Recently developed large-area pressure sensors made with organic transistors have been proposed for electronic artificial skin (E-skin) applications. These sensors are bendable down to a 2-mm radius, a size that is sufficiently small for the fabrication of human-sized robot fingers. Natural human skin, however, is far more complex than the transistor-based imitations demonstrated so far. It performs other functions, including thermal sensing. Furthermore, without conformability, the application of E-skin on three-dimensional surfaces is impossible. In this work, we have successfully developed conformable, flexible, large-area networks of thermal and pressure sensors based on an organic semiconductor. A plastic film with organic transistor-based electronic circuits is processed to form a net-shaped structure, which allows the E-skin films to be extended by 25%. The net-shaped pressure sensor matrix was attached to the surface of an egg, and pressure images were successfully obtained in this configuration. Then, a similar network of thermal sensors was developed with organic semiconductors. Next, the possible implementation of both pressure and thermal sensors on the surfaces is presented, and, by means of laminated sensor networks, the distributions of pressure and temperature are simultaneously obtained.},

abstract = {It is now widely accepted that skin sensitivity will be very important for future robots used by humans in daily life for housekeeping and entertainment purposes. Despite this fact, relatively little progress has been made in the field of pressure recognition compared to the areas of sight and voice recognition, mainly because good artificial "electronic skin" with a large area and mechanical flexibility is not yet available. The fabrication of a sensitive skin consisting of thousands of pressure sensors would require a flexible switching matrix that cannot be realized with present silicon-based electronics. Organic field-effect transistors can substitute for such conventional electronics because organic circuits are inherently flexible and potentially ultralow in cost even for a large area. Thus, integration of organic transistors and rubber pressure sensors, both of which can be produced by low-cost processing technology such as large-area printing technology, will provide an ideal solution to realize a practical artificial skin, whose feasibility has been demonstrated in this paper. Pressure images have been taken by flexible active matrix drivers with organic transistors whose mobility reaches as high as 1.4 cm(2)/V.s. The device is electrically functional even when it is wrapped around a cylindrical bar with a 2-mm radius.},

A generalizable framework of behavioral primitives for tactile and visual feedback control is proposed. Since vision provides position and shape information at a distance, while tactile provides small-scale geometric and force information, we focus on the complimentary roles of vision and touch. We demonstrate that visual feedback can perform the rough positioning needed for tactile sensor feedback, and that grasp force and object orientation can be sensed and controlled with tactile sensing. A force sensor based approach provides a comparison measure, and we observe that the use of tactile sensing results in a more gentle grasp.},

The assessment of 3-D spatial skill and associated gender differences has been a topic of educational research for nearly a century; however, a great deal of the previous work has been aimed at merely identifying differences. The author has been conducting applied research in the area of spatial skills development for more than a decade aimed at identifying proctical methods for improving 3-D spatial skills, especially for women engineering students. This paper details the significant findings obtained over the past several years through this research and identifies strategies that appear to be effective in developing 3-D spatial skills and in contributing to student success.},

abstract = {Terrestrial arthropods negotiate demanding terrain more effectively than any search-and-rescue robot. Slow, precise stepping using distributed neural feedback is one strategy for dealing with challenging terrain. Alternatively, arthropods could simplify control on demanding surfaces by rapid running that uses kinetic energy to bridge gaps between footholds. We demonstrate that this is achieved using distributed mechanical feedback, resulting from passive contacts along legs positioned by pre-programmed trajectories favorable to their attachment mechanisms. We used wire-mesh experimental surfaces to determine how a decrease in foothold probability affects speed and stability. Spiders and insects attained high running speeds on simulated terrain with 90% of the surface contact area removed. Cockroaches maintained high speeds even with their tarsi ablated, by generating horizontally oriented leg trajectories. Spiders with more vertically directed leg placement used leg spines, which resulted in more effective distributed contact by interlocking with asperities during leg extension, but collapsing during flexion, preventing entanglement. Ghost crabs, which naturally lack leg spines, showed increased mobility on wire mesh after the addition of artificial, collapsible spines. A bioinspired robot, RHex, was redesigned to maximize effective distributed leg contact, by changing leg orientation and adding directional spines. These changes improved RHex's agility on challenging surfaces without adding sensors or changing the control system.},

abstract = {In nature, cockroaches run rapidly over complex terrain such as leaf litter. These substrates are rarely rigid, and are frequently very compliant. Whether and how compliant surfaces change the dynamics of rapid insect locomotion has not been investigated to date largely due to experimental limitations. We tested the hypothesis that a running insect can maintain average forward speed over an extremely soft elastic surface (10 N m(-1)) equal to 2/3 of its virtual leg stiffness (15 N m(-1)). Cockroaches Blaberus discoidalis were able to maintain forward speed (mean +/- s.e.m., 37.2+/-0.6 cm s(-1) rigid surface versus 38.0+/-0.7 cm s(-1) elastic surface; repeated-measures ANOVA, P=0.45). Step frequency was unchanged (24.5+/-0.6 steps s(-1) rigid surface versus 24.7+/-0.4 steps s(-1) elastic surface; P=0.54). To uncover the mechanism, we measured the animal's centre of mass (COM) dynamics using a novel accelerometer backpack, attached very near the COM. Vertical acceleration of the COM on the elastic surface had a smaller peak-to-peak amplitude (11.50+/-0.33 m s(-2), rigid versus 7.7+/-0.14 m s(-2), elastic; P=0.04). The observed change in COM acceleration over an elastic surface required no change in effective stiffness when duty factor and ground stiffness were taken into account. Lowering of the COM towards the elastic surface caused the swing legs to land earlier, increasing the period of double support. A feedforward control model was consistent with the experimental results and provided one plausible, simple explanation of the mechanism.},

abstract = {Stickybot is a bioinspired robot that climbs smooth vertical surfaces such as glass, plastic, and ceramic tile at 4 cm/s. The robot employs several design principles adapted from the gecko including a hierarchy of compliant structures, directional adhesion, and control of tangential contact forces to achieve control of adhesion. We describe the design and fabrication methods used to create underactuated, multimaterial structures that conform to surfaces over a range of length scales from centimeters to micrometers. At the finest scale, the undersides of Stickybot's toes are covered with arrays of small, angled polymer stalks. Like the directional adhesive structures used by geckos, they readily adhere when pulled tangentially from the tips of the toes toward the ankles; when pulled in the opposite direction, they release. Working in combination with the compliant structures and directional adhesion is a force control strategy that balances forces among the feet and promotes smooth attachment and detachment of the toes.},

The soft exosuit is designed to provide 25% of the knee moment required during the swing phase of the gait cycle and is integrated with inertial measurement units (IMUs) and smart shoe insole sensors to improve gait phase detection and controller design. The stiffness of the knee joint during level walking is computed using inverse dynamics. The soft-inflatable actuators, with an I cross-section, are mechanically characterized at varying angles to enable generation of the required stiffness outputs. A linear relation between the inflatable actuator stiffness and internal pressure as a function of the knee angle is obtained, and a two-layer stiffness controller is implemented to assist the knee joint by providing appropriate stiffness during the swing phase. Finally, to evaluate the ability of the exosuit to assist in swing motion, surface-electromyography (sEMG) sensors are placed on the three muscle groups of the quadriceps and two groups of the hamstrings, on three healthy participants. A reduction in muscle activity of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis is observed, which demonstrates feasibility of operation and potential future usage of the soft inflatable exosuit by impaired users.},

abstract = {We describe a program called SketchIT capable of producing multiple families of designs from a single sketch. The program is given a rough sketch (drawn using line segments for part faces and icons for springs and kinematic joints) and a description of the desired behavior. The sketch is "rough" in the sense that taken literally, it mat not work. From this single, perhaps flawed sketch and the behavior description, the program produces an entire family of working designs. The program also produces design variants, each of which is itself a family of designs. SketchIT represents each family of designs with a "behavior ensuring parametric model" (BEP-Model), a parametric model augmented with a set of constraints that ensure the geometry provides the desired behavior. The construction of the BEP-Model from the sketch and behavior description is the primary task and source of difficulty in this undertaking. SketchIT begins by abstracting the sketch to produce a qualitative configuration space (qc-space) which it then uses as its primary representation of behavior. SketchIT modifies this initial qc-space until qualitative simulation verifies that it produces the desired behavior. SketchIT's task is then to find geometries that implement this qc-space. It does this using a library of qc-space fragments. Each fragment is a piece of parametric geometry with a set of constraints that ensure the geometry implements a specific kind of boundary (qcs-curve) in qc-space. SketchIT assembles the fragments to produce the BEP-Model. SketchIT produces design variants by mapping the qc-space to multiple implementations, and by trasforming rotating parts to translating parts and vice versa.},

abstract = {The use of 3D printing has rapidly expanded in the past couple of years. It is now possible to produce 3D-printed objects with exceptionally high fidelity and precision. However, although the quality of 3D printing has improved, both the time to print and the material costs have remained high. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a printed model is structurally sound. The printed product often does not survive cleaning, transportation, or handling, or it may even collapse under its own weight. We present a system that addresses this issue by providing automatic detection and correction of the problematic cases. The structural problems are detected by combining a lightweight structural analysis solver with 3D medial axis approximations. After areas with high structural stress are found, the model is corrected by combining three approaches: hollowing, thickening, and strut insertion. Both detection and correction steps are repeated until the problems have been eliminated. Our process is designed to create a model that is visually similar to the original model but possessing greater structural integrity. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM 0730-0301/2012/08-ART48.},

In this paper, we present a tactile-driven approach that dynamically uses the robot's grasping experience to address this issue. During the grasp movement, the current contact information is used to dynamically adapt the grasping control by targeting the best matching posture from the experience base. Thus, the robot recalls and actuates a grasp it already successfully performed in a similar tactile context. To efficiently represent the experience, we introduce the grasp manifold assuming that grasp postures form a smooth manifold in hand posture space. We present a simple way of providing approximations of grasp manifolds using self-organising maps (SOMs). The algorithm is evaluated on three different geometry primitives - box, cylinder and sphere - in a physics-based computer simulation.},

abstract = {A simple and very accurate method to approximate a function with a finite number of discontinuities is presented. This method relies on hyperbolic tangent functions of rational arguments as connecting functions at the discontinuities, each argument being the reciprocal of Newton binomials that depend on the abscissae that define the domain of the discontinuous function and upon the abscissae of discontinuities. Our approximants take the form of linear combinations of such hyperbolic tangent functions with coefficients that are obtained by solving a linear system of inhomogeneous equations whose righthand sides are the partition functions that define the given discontinuous function. These approximants are analytic, and being free from the Gibbs phenomenon certainly converge at the discontinuity points much better than other known approximants to discontinuous functions, typical relative errors being of the order of 10-14 even when as close as 10-12 to the discontinuity points. Moreover, they can be readily scaled to larger intervals. Our method is here illustrated with a representative set of discontinuous mathematical physics functions, and by studying the dynamics of an oscillator subjected to a discontinuous force, but it can be applied to important cases of discontinuous functions in physics, mathematics, engineering and physical chemistry.},

The automation of these machines offers promise for increasing productivity and improving safety. To date, most research in this area has focused on selected parts of the problem. In this paper we present a system that completely automates the truck loading task. The excavator uses two scanning laser rangefinders to recognize and localize the truck, measure the soil face, and detect obstacles. The excavator's software decides where to dig in the soil, where to dump in the truck, and how to quickly move between these points while detecting and stopping for obstacles. The system was fully implemented and was demonstrated to load trucks as fast as human operators},

The center of mass (COM) dynamics are affected directly through contact force control to achieve stable balance. This idea is used to formulate DBFC considering the full rigid-body dynamics of the robot to produce desired contact forces. To achieve generic force control tasks, a virtual model controller, DBFC-VMC, is presented.

@article{Stoner2018,
abstract = {Functionally graded materials (FGMs) gradually change composition throughout their volume, allowing for areas of a part to be optimized for specific performance requirements. While additive manufacturing (AM) process types such as material jetting and directed energy deposition are capable of creating FGMs, design guidelines for varying the material composition in an FGM do not exist. This article presents a novel design solution for FGMs: creating the material gradient by varying the mesostructural size and thickness of bicontinuous, multi-material geometries. By using a bicontinuous structure, such as Schoen's gyroid surface or Schwarz's P and D surfaces, each component material exists as a continuous discrete structure, which allows FGMs to be fabricated by a wider range of AM processes. The gradient is created by varying the volume fraction occupied by the surface structure inside the part volume. This article explores the use of this technique to create FGMs with material extrusion AM. Properties of these bicontinuous structures are experimentally characterized and shown to outperform typical material extrusion FGMs.},

@article{Stowers2015,
abstract = {We present a new mechanism for passive wing morphing of flapping wings inspired by bat and bird wing morphology. The mechanism consists of an unactuated hand wing connected to the arm wing with a wrist joint. Flapping motion generates centrifugal accelerations in the hand wing, forcing it to unfold passively. Using a robotic model in hover, we made kinematic measurements of unfolding kinematics as functions of the non-dimensional wingspan fold ratio (2–2.5) and flapping frequency (5–17 Hz) using stereo high-speed cameras. We find that the wings unfold passively within one to two flaps and remain unfolded with only small amplitude oscillations. To better understand the passive dynamics, we constructed a computer model of the unfolding process based on rigid body dynamics, contact models, and aerodynamic correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced by flapping. The simulations also predict that relative unfolding time only weakly depends on flapping frequency and can be reduced to less than half a wingbeat by increasing flapping amplitude. Subsequent dimensional analysis shows that the time required to unfold passively is of the same order of magnitude as the flapping period. This suggests that centrifugal acceleration can drive passive unfolding within approximately one wingbeat in small and large wings. Finally, we show experimentally that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch, by first folding and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze through clutter without sophisticated control. Passive unfolding also provides a new avenue in morphing wing design that makes future flapping morphing wings possibly more energy efficient and light-weight. Simultaneously these results point to possible inertia driven, and therefore metabolically efficient, control strategies in bats and birds to morph or recover within a beat.},

abstract = {Underactuated, compliant, tendon-driven robotic hands are suited for deep-sea exploration. The robust Ocean One hand design utilizes elastic finger joints and a spring transmission to achieve a variety of pinch and wrap grasps. Compliance in the fingers and transmission determines the degree of load-sharing among contacts and the hands' ability to secure irregularly shaped objects. However, it can also decrease external grasp stiffness and acquisition reliability. SimGrasp, a flexible dynamic hand simulator, enables parametric studies of the hand for acquisition and pull-out tests with varying transmission spring rates. In the present application, we take advantage of achieving different stiffnesses by reversing the direction of tendon windup using a torsional spring-loaded winch. With this provision, the hand can be relatively soft for handling delicate objects and stiff for tasks requiring strength. Two hands were field-tested as part of the Ocean One humanoid platform, which acquired a vase from the La Lune shipwreck site at a 91 m depth in the Mediterranean Sea.},

abstract = {The structural design, control system, and integrated biofeedback for a wearable exoskeletal robot for upper extremity stroke rehabilitation are presented. Assisted with clinical evaluation, designers, engineers, and scientists have built a device for robotic assisted upper extremity repetitive therapy (RUPERT). Intense, repetitive physical rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial overcoming upper extremity deficits, but the therapy is labor intensive and expensive and difficult to evaluate quantitatively and objectively. The RUPERT is developed to provide a low cost, safe and easy-to-use, robotic-device to assist the patient and therapist to achieve more systematic therapy at home or in the clinic. The RUPERT has four actuated degrees-of-freedom driven by compliant and safe pneumatic muscles (PMs) on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. They are programmed to actuate the device to extend the arm and move the arm in 3-D space. It is very important to note that gravity is not compensated and the daily tasks are practiced in a natural setting. Because the device is wearable and lightweight to increase portability, it can be worn standing or sitting providing therapy tasks that better mimic activities of daily living. The sensors feed back position and force information for quantitative evaluation of task performance. The device can also provide real-time, objective assessment of functional improvement. We have tested the device on stroke survivors performing two critical activities of daily living (ADL): reaching out and self feeding. The future improvement of the device involves increased degrees-of-freedom and interactive control to adapt to a user's physical conditions.},

@article{Sumbre2006,
abstract = {One of the key problems in motor control is mastering or reducing the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) through coordination [1]. This problem is especially prominent with hyper-redundant limbs such as the extremely flexible arm of the octopus [2]. Several strategies for simplifying these control problems have been suggested for human point-to-point arm movements [3-6]. Despite the evolutionary gap and morphological differences, humans and octopuses evolved similar strategies when fetching food to the mouth. To achieve this precise point-to-point-task, octopus arms generate a quasi-articulated structure based on three dynamic joints. A rotational movement around these joints brings the object to the mouth [7]. Here, we describe a peripheral neural mechanism-two waves of muscle activation propagate toward each other, and their collision point sets the medial-joint location. This is a remarkably simple mechanism for adjusting the length of the segments according to where the object is grasped. Furthermore, similar to certain human arm movements, kinematic invariants were observed at the joint level rather than at the end-effector level, suggesting intrinsic control coordination. The evolutionary convergence to similar geometrical and kinematic features suggests that a kinematically constrained articulated limb controlled at the level of joint space is the optimal solution for precise point-to-point movements. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Compliant actuator is widely accepted for physical human-robot interaction due to its safety aspect, dynamic performance improvements and energy saving abilities. In this paper, based on the variable ratio lever mechanism, a new kind of Serial Variable Stiffness Actuator (SVSA) is proposed by using an Archimedean Spiral Relocation Mechanism (ASRM) to change the position of the pivot, implementing large range of adjustable stiffness. The ASRM introduced here makes the SVSA design has continuous stiffness adjustment ability and simply mechanical structure. Within the Variable Stiffness Mechanism (VSM), two linear springs are assembled antagonistically on a spring shaft. Their displacements are perpendicular to the output link to transmit the spring force more efficiently. Stiffness modeling and analysis of the SVSA are carried out to cover large deflection angle. The physical implementation of the SVSA shows that the output stiffness of the VSM is changed from 1.72 to 150.56 Nm/rad using a linear spring with stiffness 1882 N/m, working range covered from 0 to 360 °. Control experiments also proved the wide range of stiffness adjustment ability of the SVSA.},

The robot arm equipped with the sensor can perform active object recognition. Our research goal is to realize an effective robot controller for the 3D object handling. An additional final aim is to produce "artifacts" that is a kind of artificial creature, which enables to cooperate works between human and machine (robot) in a natural and intuitive manner. Throughout these works, we aim to realize a harmonized human-machine environment. The two examples of applications of the proposed tactile sensor are also introduced. First is a hand pose control to keep the moving direction normal to the object, which is often required in pushing an object for positioning. This application can be used for human-machine interaction tasks. Next is a hand pose and motion control for 3D-object edge tracing, which is required for industrial use such as welding machines and welding inspection. In these applications, we need no information about object shape or orientation in advance. We also show three experimental results using the proposed sensor unit. The system and results of experiments are presented.},

In these workshops, the systems developers get input to design from observing how users stage and act out current and future use scenarios and improvise new technology to fit their needs. A theoretical framework is presented to explain the creative processes involved and the workshop as a user- centered design method. Our findings encourage us to recommend the presented workshop structure for design projects involving mobility and computer-mediated communication, in particular project where the future use of the resulting products and services also needs to be designed.},

In the case of fish schooling, new insights into processes such as collective deci- sion making and leadership have been made in recent expe- riments in which live fish were interacting with robotic fish driven along preplanned paths. We introduce a new cyber– physical implementation that enables robotic fish to use real- time feedback to control their motion in response to live fish and other environmental features. Each robotic fish is magne- tically connected to, and thus moved by, a wheeled robot underneath the tank. Real-time image processing of a video stream from an overhead camera provides measurements of both the robotic fish and the live fish moving together in the tank. Feedback responses computed fromthesemeasurements are communicated to the robotic fish using Bluetooth.We show results of demonstrations and discuss possibilities that our im- plementation affords for new kinds of behavioral experiments with fish schools.},

Large numbers of these cells might be combined and externally powered to change phase, contracting to either articulate with a large strain or increase the stiffness of the ensemble, depending on the cell design. Unlike traditional work in modular robotics, the approach presented here focuses on cells that have a simplistic design and function, are inexpensive to fabricate, and are eventually scalable to sub-millimeter sizes, working towards our vision of robot structures that can be custom-fabricated from large numbers of general cell units, similar to biological structures.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first practical method for "origamizing" or obtaining the folding pattern that folds a single sheet of material into a given polyhedral surface without any cut. The basic idea is to tuck fold a planar paper to form a three-dimensional shape. The main contribution is to solve the inverse problem; the input is an arbitrary polyhedral surface and the output is the folding pattern. Our approach is to convert this problem into a problem of laying out the polygons of the surface on a planar paper by introducing the concept of tucking molecules. We investigate the equality and inequality conditions required for constructing a valid crease pattern. We propose an algorithm based on two-step mapping and edge splitting to solve these conditions. The two-step mapping precalculates linear equalities and separates them from other conditions. This allows an interactive manipulation of the crease pattern in the system implementation. We present the first system for designing three-dimensional origami, enabling a user can interactively design complex spatial origami models that have not been realizable thus far.},

However, it is known that the developable double corrugation surface, known as Miura-ori, produces a rigid deployment mechanism. The rigid-foldability of Miura-ori is due to the singularity in its pattern, where a single vertex is repeated. We generalize the geometric condition for enabling rigid motion in general quadrilateral-mesh origami without simple repeating symmetry. To ensure the existence of a finite motion, we derive the identity of functions from the formula for degree-4 single-vertex origami. This yields a variety of unexplored generalized shapes of quadrilateral-mesh origami that preserve one-DOF'finite rigid-foldability in addition to developability and flat-foldability.},

The discretized form is a rigid origami structure with at most one degree of freedom. The form adjustment follows the discretization so that it is sure to realize a mechanism. The workshop performed by the authors based on the proposed design method is reported. The objective of the workshop was to utilize the 1DOF characteristic of discretized curved folds as a constraint in the design of dynamic architectural components. The results showed the feasibility of the method and suggested a novel methodology for designing.},

abstract = {The present paper describes an implementation of fast running motions involving a humanoid robot. Two important technologies are described: a motion generation and a balance control. The motion generation is a unified way to design both walking and running and can generate the trajectory with the vertical conditions of the Center Of Mass (COM) in short calculation time. The balance control enables a robot to maintain balance by changing the positions of the contact foot dynamically when the robot is disturbed. This control consists of 1) compliance control without force sensors, in which the joints are made compliant by feed-forward torques and adjustment of gains of position control, and 2) feedback control, which uses the measured orientation of the robot's torso used in the motion generation as an initial condition to decide the foot positions. Finally, a human-sized humanoid robot that can run forward at 7.0 [km/h] is presented.},

This paper describes a design of bipedal robot and feed forward controller that realize multi-modal locomotion by tuning appropriate leg compliance on individual locomotion. In order to tune physical leg compliance, we adopt rotational joints driven by antagonistic McKibben pneumatic muscles. Experimental results show that proper leg compliance provided by joint compliance and leg posture achieves a walking from standing and a sequential jumping. These results suggest that tunable leg compliance is powerful mechanism for bipedal robot to provide human-like multi-modal locomotion. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

This paper investigates the wing performance of Caudipteryx, the most basal non-volant dinosaur with pennaceous feathered forelimbs by using modal effective mass theory. From a mechanical standpoint, the forced vibrations excited by hindlimb locomotion stimulate the movement of wings, creating a flapping-like motion in response. This shows that the origin of the avian flight stroke should lie in a completely natural process of active locomotion on the ground. In this regard, flapping in the history of evolution of avian flight should have already occurred when the dinosaurs were equipped with pennaceous remiges and rectrices. The forced vibrations provided the initial training for flapping the feathered wings of theropods similar to Caudipteryx.},

The proposed method computes key soil parameters by measuring the forces acting on the excavator bucket whilst being in contact with the soil and minimizing the error between measured forces and estimated forces produced by a real-time capable soil model. Two soil models, the Mohr-Coulomb soil model and the Chen and Liu upper bound soil model, are implemented and researched in the context of this estimation scheme. Parameter optimization is carried out employing the Newton Raphson method. The method is evaluated using experimental data and through comparison with an approach that makes use of graphical intersection for model optimization [1]. The results demonstrate that the proposed Newton Raphson-based method is as accurate as the graphical intersection-based approach, but up to 2000 times faster, and, thus, most suitable for on-line soil parameter estimation in an automated system which provides optimized digging trajectories for a given excavation task.},

Such challenges include maneuvering in the presence of ambient disturbances, localization with adequate precision, sustained operation with minimal human interference, and cooperative control and sensing under communication constraints.

abstract = {This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study: speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable. This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores; four species of primates; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed (VO2/Mb) during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species): VO2/Mb = 0.533 Mb-0.316.vg + 0.300 Mb-0.303 where VO2/Mb has the units ml O2 s-1 kg-1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s-1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Emetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20.1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible: Emetab/Mb = 10.7 Mb-0.316.vg + 6.03 Mb-0.303 where Emetab/Mb has the units watts/kg. This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen & Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this genera equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400% over this size range of animals.},

First, we present the reduced-order dynamic models used to tune the characteristics of the robot's passive gait. Our sagittal plane model is closely related to the compass gait model, but the steady state trajectory passively converges from a much larger range of initial conditions. We then experimentally quantify the stability of the mechanical device. Finally, we present an actuated version of the robot and some preliminary active control strategies. The control problem for the actuated version of the robot is interesting because although it is theoretically challenging (4 degrees of under-actuation), the mechanical design of the robot made it relatively easy to create controllers which allowed the robot to walk stably on flat terrain and even up a small slope.},

abstract = {Prompted by the development of algorithms for analysing geometric tolerancing, this article describes a method to determine the Minkowski sum for 3-dimension polytopes. This purposed method is based exclusively on intersection operations on normal cones, using the properties of the normal fan of a Minkowski sum obtained by common refinement of the normal fans of the operands. It can be used to determine from which vertices of the operands the vertices of the Minkowski sum derive. It is also possible to determine to which facets of the operands each facet of the Minkowski sum is oriented. First, the main properties of the duality of normal cones and primal cones associated with the vertices of a polytope are described. Next, the properties of normal fans are applied to define the vertices and facets of the Minkowski sum of two polytopes. An algorithm is proposed which generalises the method. An example shows the application of the method on an assembly made up of two parts. Lastly, there is a discussion of the features of this algorithm, developed using the OpenCascade environment.},

Here, we show that by adding aerodynamic dampers, we can can alter the vehicle's dynamics to stabilize its upright orientation. We provide an analysis using wind tunnel experiments and a dynamic model. We demonstrate stable vertical takeoff, and using a marker-based external camera tracking system, hovering altitude control in an active feedback loop. These results provide a stable platform for both system dynamics characterization and unconstrained active maneuvers of the vehicle and represent the first known hovering demonstration of an insect-scale flapping-wing robot.},

abstract = {Natural organisms have a unique property not yet available in robotics, i.e., a self-healing (SH) ability. This powerful biological healing function has inspired chemists to impart similar properties to synthetic materials to create “SH materials.” Recent developments in SH polymers led us to investigate the potential of using these materials in robotics. This paper presents an innovative approach of using SH polymers, based on the reversible Diels–Alder (DA) reaction, in a compliant actuator. Using DA polymers, a sacrificial SH mechanical fuse (SH-MF) is designed, developed, and validated by placing it in a cable-driven robotic system. The fuse is designed as weakest element and will sacrificially fail if a damaging overload occurs, protecting the compliant element and other components of the system. The experimental results showed that this SH-MF could be healed at a relatively low temperature, recovering the initial mechanical properties. This first working prototype indicates the feasibility to use SH materials in robotics. “SH robotics” will lead to more sustainable and lighter systems, and eventually to more efficient designs.

The robot overcomes many of the weaknesses of its predecessor, the TheraDrive system, that used a Logitech steering wheel as the haptic interface for rehabilitation. Although the original TheraDrive system showed success in a pilot study, its wheel was not able to withstand the rigors of use. A new haptic robot was developed that functions as a drop-in replacement for the Logitech wheel. The new robot can apply larger forces in interacting with the patient, thereby extending the functionality of the system to accommodate low-functioning patients. A new software suite offers appreciably more options for tailored and tuned rehabilitation therapies. In addition to describing the design of the hardware and software, the paper presents the results of simulation and experimental case studies examining the system's performance and usability. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {To reduce the complexity of controlling hand-shaping, recent evidence suggests that the central nervous system uses synergies. In this study, two Rhesus monkeys reached-to-grasp 15 objects, varying in geometric properties, at five grasp force levels. Hand kinematics were recorded using a video-based tracking system. Individual finger movements were described as vectors varying in length and angle. Inflection points (i.e., stereotypic minima/maxima in the temporal profile of each finger vector) exhibited a temporal synchrony for individual fingers and in the coupling across fingers. Inflection point amplitudes varied significantly across objects grasped, scaling linearly with the object grasp dimension. Thus, differences in the vectors as a function of the objects were in the relative scaling of the vector parameters over time rather than a change in the temporal structure. Mahalanobis distance analysis of the inflection points confirmed that changes in inflection point amplitude as a function of objects were greater than changes in timing. Inflection points were independent of the grasp force, consistent with the observation that reach-to-grasp kinematics and grasp force are controlled independently. In summary, the shaping of the hand during reach-to-grasp involves scaling the amplitude of highly stereotypic temporal movements of the fingers.},

abstract = {The attachment of dissimilar materials is a major challenge because of the high levels of stress that develop at such interfaces. An effective solution to this problem develops at the attachment of tendon (a compliant "soft tissue") to bone (a stiff "hard tissue"). This tissue, the "enthesis", transitions from tendon to bone through gradations in structure, composition, and mechanical properties. These gradations are not regenerated during tendon-to-bone healing, leading to a high incidence of failure after surgical repair. Understanding the development of the enthesis may allow scientists to develop treatments that regenerate the natural tendon-to-bone insertion. Recent work has demonstrated that both biologic and mechanical factors drive the development and morphogenesis of the enthesis. A cascade of biologic signals similar to those seen in the growth plate promotes mineralization of cartilage on the bony end of the enthesis and the formation of fibrocartilage on the tendon end of the enthesis. Mechanical loading is also necessary for the development of the enthesis. Removal of muscle load impairs the formation of bone, fibrocartilage, and tendon at the developing enthesis. This paper reviews recent work on the development of the enthesis, with an emphasis on the roles of biologic and mechanical factors.},

abstract = {Anatomical differences among squirrels are usually most evident in the comparison of flying squirrels and nongliding squirrels. This is true of wrist anatomy, probably reflecting the specializations of flying squirrels for the extension of the wing tip and control of it during gliding. In the proximal row of carpals of most squirrels, the pisiform articulates only with the triquetrum, but in flying squirrels there is also a prominent articulation between the pisiform and the scapholunate, providing a more stable base for the styliform cartilage, which supports the wing tip. In the proximal wrist joint, between these carpals and the radius and ulna, differences in curvature of articular surfaces and in the location of ligaments also correlate with differences in degree and kind of movement occurring at this joint, principally reflecting the extreme dorsal flexion and radial deviation of the wrist in flying squirrels when gliding. The distal wrist joint, between the proximal and distal rows of carpals, also shows most variation among flying squirrels, principally in the articulations of the centrale with the other carpal bones, probably causing the distal row of carpal bones to function more like a single unit in some animals. There is little variation in wrist musculature, suggesting only minor evolutionary modification since the tribal radiation of squirrels, probably in the early Oligocene. Variation in the carpal bones, particularly the articulation of the pisiform with the triquetrum and the scapholunate, suggests a different suprageneric grouping of flying squirrels than previously proposed by McKenna (1962) and Mein (1970).

abstract = {Within the forest canopy, the shortest gaps between tree crowns lie between slender terminal branches. While the compliance of these supports has previously been shown to increase the energetic cost of gap crossing in arboreal animals (e.g. Alexander 1991 Z. Morphol. Anthropol. 78, 315-320; Demes et al. 1995 Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 96, 419-429), field observations suggest that some primates may be able to use support compliance to increase the energetic efficiency of locomotion. Here, we calculate the energetic cost of alternative methods of gap crossing in orangutans (Pongo abelii). Tree sway (in which orangutans oscillate a compliant tree trunk with increasing magnitude to bridge a gap) was found to be less than half as costly as jumping, and an order of magnitude less costly than descending the tree, walking to the vine and climbing it. Observations of wild orangutans suggest that they actually use support compliance in many aspects of their locomotor behaviour. This study seems to be the first to show that elastic compliance in arboreal supports can be used to reduce the energetic cost of gap crossing.},

abstract = {When designing a 3D object, designers, engineers and teachers often begin investigating potential design tradeoffs by creating informal sketches. Ideally, these sketches-in combination with a variety of engineering analysis tools-would allow prediction of the object's physical properties, especially those that affect the critical early design process. We introduce a pen-based system that reconstructs 3D spatial geometry from a single 2D freehand-sketch consisting of straight and curved lines in interactive time. Several optimization-based approaches to this problem have been proposed, but these generally have difficulty converging to an acceptable solution because the dimensionality of the search space is large. The primary contribution of this paper is a new reconstruction algorithm for orthographic projections of 3D wireframes. The algorithm reconstructs the depths of each vertex by exploiting geometric regularities among the graph lines in a reduced solution space, then optimizes a cost function over this space to recover the vertex depths. A second optimization algorithm is used to infer the 3D geometry of curved strokes once the vertex depths have been recovered. The proposed approach can recover the geometry of several objects with approximately 50 curved strokes in near interactive time. We also present an iterative, Tablet-PC-based design system that uses the proposed reconstruction algorithm to recover 3D objects from 2D orthographic sketches. The system allows the reconstructed objects to be subjected to two types of physical analysis, the results of which are superimposed directly on the sketch: a fast, kinematic simulation, and a complete finite-element-based static analysis. The object can quickly be modified in place using the pen-based interface according to the results of the analysis to allow for iterative design work. We demonstrate the system in action on a variety of early-stage design analyses. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Seven form-finding methods for tensegrity structures are reviewed and clas- sified. The three kinematical methods include an analytical approach, a non-linear optimisation, and a pseudo-dynamic iteration. The four statical methods include an analytical method, the formulation of linear equations of equilibrium in terms of force densities, an energy minimisation, and a search for the equilibrium configurations of the struts of the structure con- nected by cables whose lengths are to be determined, using a reduced set of equilibrium equations. It is concluded that the kinematical methods are best suited to obtaining only configuration details of structures that are already essentially known, the force density method is best suited to searching for new configurations, but affords no control over the lengths of the elements of the structure. The reduced coordinates method offers a greater control on elements lengths, but requires more extensive symbolic manipulations.},

abstract = {Stability is fundamental to the performance of terrestrial locomotion. Running cockroaches met the criteria for static stability over a wide range of speeds, yet several locomotor variables changed in a way that revealed an increase in the importance of dynamic stability as speed increased. Duty factors (the fraction of time that a leg spends on the ground relative to the stride period) decreased to 0.5 and below with an increase in speed. The duration of double support (i.e. when both tripods, or all six legs, were on the ground) decreased significantly with an increase in speed. All legs had similar touch-down phases in the tripod, but the shortest leg, the front one, lifted off before the middle and the rear leg, so that only two legs of the tripod were in contact with the ground at the highest speeds. Per cent stability margin (the shortest distance from the center of gravity to the boundaries of support, normalized to the maximum possible stability margin) decreased with increasing speed from 60% at 10 cms-1 to values less than zero at speeds faster than 50 cms-1, indicating instances of static instability at fast speeds. The center of mass moved rearward or posteriorly with respect to the base of support as speed increased. Moments about the center of mass, as shown by the center of pressure (the equivalent of a single 'effective' leg), were variable, but were balanced by opposing moments over a stride. Thus, hexapods can exploit the advantages of both static and dynamic stability. Static or quasi-static assumptions alone were insufficient to explain straight-ahead, constant-speed locomotion and may hinder discovery of behaviors that are dynamic, where kinetic energy and momentum can act as a bridge from one step to the next.},

abstract = {The natural selection and the evolutionary optimization of complex shapes in nature are closely related to their functions. Mechanostabilization of shape of biological structure via morphogenesis has several beautiful ex- amples. With the help of simple mechanics-based modeling and experiments, we show an important causality between natural shape selection as evolutionary outcome and the mechanostabilization of seashells. The effect of biological growth on the mechanostabilization process is identified with examples of two natural shapes of seashells, one having a diametrically converging localization of stresses and the other having a helicoidally con- centric localization of stresses. We demonstrate how the evolved shape enables predictable protection of soft body parts of the species. The effect of bioavailability of natural material is found to be a secondary factor com- pared to shape selectivity, where material microstructure only acts as a constraint to evolutionary optimization. This is confirmed by comparing the mechanostabilization behavior of three-dimensionally printed synthetic poly- mer structural shapes with that of natural seashells consisting of ceramic and protein. This study also highlights interesting possibilities in achieving a new design of structures made of ordinary materials which have bio- inspired optimization objectives.},

abstract = {To evaluate the mechanisms responsible for relationships between body mass and maximum take-off performance in birds, we studied four species in the Phasianidae: northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), chukar (Alectoris chukar), ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). These species vary in body mass from 0.2 to 5.3 kg, and they use flight almost solely to escape predators. During take-off, all the species used a similar wingbeat style that appeared to be a vortex-ring gait with a tip reversal during the upstroke. The tip reversal is unusual for birds with rounded wings; it may offer an aerodynamic advantage during rapid acceleration. Flight anatomy generally scaled geometrically, except for average wing chord and wing area, which increased more than expected as body mass (m) increased. Pectoralis strain varied from 19.1 to 35.2 % and scaled in proportion to m(0.23). This positive scaling is not consistent with the widely held assumption that muscle strain is independent of body mass among geometrically similar species. The anatomy of the species precluded measurements of in vivo pectoralis force using the strain-gauge technique that has been employed successfully in other bird species, so we could not directly test in vivo pectoralis force-velocity relationships. However, whole-body kinematics revealed that take-off power (P(ta)), the excess power available for climbing and accelerating in flight, scaled in proportion to m(0.75) and that pectoralis mass-specific P(ta) decreased in proportion to m(-)(0.26) and was directly proportional to wingbeat frequency. These trends suggest that mass-specific pectoralis work did not vary with body mass and that pectoralis stress and strain were inversely proportional, as expected from classical force-velocity models for skeletal muscle. Our observations of P(ta) were consistent with evidence from other species engaged in escape flight and, therefore, appear to contradict evidence from studies of take-off or hovering with an added payload.},

The methods are compared on stabilized trajectories of a six-state model of a satellite. First, we present a method which exactly certifies sufficient conditions for invariance despite relying on approximate trajectories from numerical integration. Our second method relaxes the constraints of the first by sampling in time. On the model system, this recovered almost identical funnels but was much faster to compute. In both cases, funnels are verified using Sum-of-Squares programming to search over time-varying quadratic Lyapunov functions. We examine both time-varying rescalings of quadratic forms computed from linearizations and searching directly over time-varying quadratic Lyapunov functions. On the model system the latter provided larger funnels at the cost of increased computation time. {\textcopyright} 2011 IFAC.},

abstract = {Nest building in social insects is among the collective processes that show highly conservative features such as basic modules (chambers and galleries) or homeostatic properties. Although ant nests share common characteristics, they exhibit a high structural variability, of which morphogenesis and underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We conducted two-dimensional nest-digging experiments under homogeneous laboratory conditions to investigate the shape diversity that emerges only from digging dynamics and without the influence of any environmental heterogeneity. These experiments revealed that, during the excavation, a morphological transition occurs because the primary circular cavity evolves into a ramified structure through a branching process. Such a transition is observed, whatever the number of ants involved, but occurs more frequently for a larger number of workers. A stochastic model highlights the central role of density effects in shape transition. These results indicate that nest digging shares similar properties with various physical, chemical, and biological systems. Moreover, our model of morphogenesis provides an explanatory framework for shape transitions in decentralized growing structures in group-living animals.},

abstract = {and micro valves are crucial components for achieving these advanced platforms. [ 3 ] Thin-fi lm piezoelectric actuators promise reliable operation and high throughput, however com-plex motions and fl exible deformations, observed in natural systems, are hard to achieve. For example, aortic valves, one of the most frequently diseased tissues, are repaired by trans-planting a synthetic mechanical device or an allograft tissue alternative. These artifi cial ones are far from the original organs whose specialized motions are achieved by fl exible hier-archically structured tissues with complex architectures. [ 4 ] On the other hand, hydrogel-based soft actuators are promising [ 5 ] due to the large extent to which they can be deformed in aqueous media, thereby conforming to an architecture that mimics natural systems. Large complex 3D architectures can be fabricated with ease, if spontaneous chemical reactions are involved in their fabrication method. Moreover, 3D ink-jet printing is reportedly applicable to the production of these polymer-based actuation systems. [ 1 ] We here demonstrate adaptive microarchitectures that exhibit a special peristaltic motion by employing hydrogel actuation on bilayered materials. The surface architectures were designed by mimicking wrinkles in nature. The organ, skin, is a good example of wrinkles with an adaptive response, where wrin-kles appear and disappear depending on the movement of the muscles underneath. Here, greatly simplifying, these surface wrinkles form on a bilayered material of a crust top layer (skin) and an elastic bottom layer (muscles). As the bottom layer con-tracts (or the top layer swells), stress-driven instabilities are gen-erated at the interface of the layers. The accumulated stress is then released through the formation of wrinkles on the crust layer. Such stimuli-responsive wrinkles were reported on arti-fi cial bilayered materials prepared from elastomers or resins. [ 6 ] Nevertheless, artifi cial wrinkles, which exhibit large deforma-tions and undergo reversible adaptive response in liquids, are still challenging and are highly required to exploit applications in biological systems. In the present study, we designed and fab-ricated a bilayered structure made of PNIPAM and hybrid silica (Figure 1 a). 3-(Methacryloxy)propyl triethoxysilane was used as a silica source to allow copolymerization with NIPAM and a cross-linker (N,N′ -methylenebis(acrylamide), MBA) at the interface of the heterogeneous two layers. The thickness of the hybrid silica layer was tuned from 680 nm to 1.5 µm by using Pluronic F127 as a viscosity improver. This approach allows the strong adhesion at the interface and, most importantly, the complex actuation in liquid phase. PNIPAM undergoes shape change at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), [ 7 ] and thereby wrinkles of submillimeter dimensions appear and disappear as a function of the changing environmental temperature. Signifi cantly large deformations (>40%), due to the fl exibility of NIPAM hydrogel, could be attained to achieve biomimicking microstructures, Soft microactuators with stimuli-responsive tunable chem-istries are highly demanded in complex multifunctional and biocompatible microdevice platforms including microelec-tromechanical systems and lab-on-a-chip. Developing multi-functional hydrogel actuators is especially of signifi cance for the nano/micro artifi cial anatomies, which perform func-tions such as transportation, selection, recognition, and others. Here we demonstrate adaptive surface wrinkles, which exhibit a peristaltic motion and a size selective transportation of micro-objects on bilayered soft materials under thermal stimulus. The bilayered materials made of thermorespon-sive poly(N-iso-propylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and hybrid silica form responsive wrinkles of submillimeter dimensions with temperature variation. This hydrogel-based actuation works at a quasi-physiological environment, which meets the crit-ical requirement for artifi cial alternatives in bioapplications. Rational design of autonomous actuators is possible through the present strategy because the formation of microarchitec-tures is driven through a versatile physical process, buckling. Complex multifunctional microdevice platforms are required for several areas of engineering and sciences, for example to provide biological insights into cells and tissues.

Each aspect of the required control is discussed. Particular attention is paid to the role of geometric modeling in target identification, to preshaping during the approach trajectory and to the requirements for autonomy in completion of the grasping task. The underlying philosophy is that of reflex control; each aspect of the grasping task is initiated and terminated using sensory data and rules of behavior derived from human expertise in such tasks. The contents and organization of the knowledge base which codifies this expertise are discussed. The fundamental assumptions upon which this control philosophy is based are identified throughout the paper. Preliminary results of a graphical simulation of hand preshaping are given.},

In our Variable Impedance Actuation (VIA) approach, actuators control in real-time both the reference position and the mechanical impedance of the moving parts in the machine in such a way to optimize performance while intrinsically guaranteeing safety. In this paper we describe an implementation of such concepts, consisting of a novel electromechanical Variable Stiffness Actuation (VSA) motor. The design and the functioning principle of the VSA are reported, along with the analysis of its dynamic behavior. A novel scheme for feedback control of this device is presented, along with experimental results showing performance and safety of a one-link arm actuated by the VSA motor. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {Revealing human movement requires lightweight, flexible systems capable of detecting mechanical parameters (like strain and pressure) while being worn comfortably by the user, and not interfering with his/her activity. In this work we address such multifaceted challenge with the development of smart garments for lower limb motion detection, like a textile kneepad and anklet in which soft sensors and readout electronics are embedded for retrieving movement of the specific joint. Stretchable capacitive sensors with a three-electrode configuration are built combining conductive textiles and elastomeric layers, and distributed around knee and ankle. Results show an excellent behavior in the $\sim$30% strain range, hence the correlation between sensors' responses and the optically tracked Euler angles is allowed for basic lower limb movements. Bending during knee flexion/extension is detected, and it is discriminated from any external contact by implementing in real time a low computational algorithm. The smart anklet is designed to address joint motion detection in and off the sagittal plane. Ankle dorsi/plantar flexion, adduction/abduction, and rotation are retrieved. Both knee and ankle smart garments show a high accuracy in movement detection, with a RMSE less than 4° in the worst case.},

@article{Trimmer2014,
abstract = {Muscular hydrostats (such as mollusks), and fluid-filled animals (such as annelids), can exploit their constant-volume tissues to transfer forces and displacements in predictable ways, much as articulated animals use hinges and levers. Although larval insects contain pressurized fluids, they also have internal air tubes that are compressible and, as a result, they have more uncontrolled degrees of freedom. Therefore, the mechanisms by which larval insects control their movements are expected to reveal useful strategies for designing soft biomimetic robots. Using caterpillars as a tractable model system, it is now possible to identify the biomechanical and neural strategies for controlling movements in such highly deformable animals. For example, the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, can stiffen its body by increasing muscular tension (and therefore body pressure) but the internal cavity (hemocoel) is not iso-barometric, nor is pressure used to directly control the movements of its limbs. Instead, fluid and tissues flow within the hemocoel and the body is soft and flexible to conform to the substrate. Even the gut contributes to the biomechanics of locomotion; it is decoupled from the movements of the body wall and slides forward within the body cavity at the start of each step. During crawling the body is kept in tension for part of the stride and compressive forces are exerted on the substrate along the axis of the caterpillar, thereby using the environment as a skeleton. The timing of muscular activity suggests that crawling is coordinated by proleg-retractor motoneurons and that the large segmental muscles produce anterograde waves of lifting that do not require precise timing. This strategy produces a robust form of locomotion in which the kinematics changes little with orientation. In different species of caterpillar, the presence of prolegs on particular body segments is related to alternative kinematics such as "inching." This suggests a mechanism for the evolution of different gaits through changes in the usage of prolegs, rather than, through extensive alterations in the motor program controlling the body wall. Some of these findings are being used to design and test novel control-strategies for highly deformable robots. These "softworm" devices are providing new insights into the challenges faced by any soft animal navigating in a terrestrial environment.},

abstract = {Unlike traditional rigid linked robots, soft robotic manipulators can bend into a wide variety of complex shapes due to control inputs and gravitational loading. This paper presents a new approach for modeling soft robotic manipulators that incorporates the effect of material nonlinearities and distributed weight and payload. The model is geometrically exact for the large curvature, shear, torsion, and extension that often occur in these manipulators. The model is based on the geometrically exact Cosserat rod theory and a fiber reinforced model of the air muscle actuators. The model is validated experimentally on the OctArm V manipulator, showing less than 5% average error for a wide range of actuation pressures and base orientations as compared to almost 50% average error for the constant-curvature model previously used by researchers. Workspace plots generated from the model show the significant effects of self-weight on OctArm V.},

abstract = {Two- and three-dimensional low-aspect-ratio (AR = 4) hovering airfoil/wing aerodynamics at a low Reynolds number (Re = 100) are numerically investigated. Regarding fluid physics, in addition to the well-known leading-edge vortex and wake-capture mechanisms, a persistent jet, induced by the shed vortices in the wake during previous strokes, and tip vortices can significantly influence the lift and power performance. While in classical stationary wing theory the tip vortices are seen as wasted energy, here, they can interact with the leading-edge vortex to contribute to the lift generated without increasing the power requirements. Using surrogate modeling techniques, the two- and three-dimensional time-averaged aerodynamic forces were predicted well over a large range of kinematic motions when compared with the Navier-Stokes solutions. The combined effects of tip vortices, leading-edge vortex, and jet can be manipulated by the choice of kinematics to make a three-dimensional wing aerodynamically better or worse than an infinitely long wing. The environmental sensitivity during hovering for select kinematics is also examined. Different freestream strengths and orientations are imposed, with the impact on vortex generation and wake interaction investigated.

abstract = {This paper describes the design and modelling of a new variable stiffness actuator (CompAct-VSA). The principle of operation of CompAct-VSA is based on a lever arm mechanism with a continuously regulated pivot point. The proposed concept allows for the development of an actuation unit with a wide range of stiffness and a fast stiffness regulation response. The implementation of the actuator makes use of a cam shaped lever arm with a variable pivot axis actuated by a rack and pinion transmission system. This realization results in a highly integrated and modular assembly. Size and weight are indeed an open issue in the VSAs design, which ultimately limit their implementation in multi-dof robotic systems. The paper introduces the mechanics, the principle of operation and the model of the actuator. Preliminary results are presented to demonstrate the fast stiffness regulation response and the wide range of stiffness achieved by the proposed CompAct-VSA design.},

To this end, two contributions are presented: i) A stable force feedback controller that can cope with inherent PAM nonlinearities is synthesized using the dissipativity theory, for each PAM unit. ii) On top of this force feedback controller, a mathematical formulation is developed to compute reference force inputs that correspond to desired joint torque and joint stiffness inputs, concerning both agonist and antagonist PAMs. This strategy enables us to introduce real-time sensory feedback; torque and stiffness control is addressed by means of PAM force feedback control with guaranteed stability. To validate the proposed control scheme, a series of experiments were conducted on an experimental setup. As the result, the controller exhibited favorable torque and stiffness tracking in real-time, demonstrating that it could meet the performance criteria to power exoskeleton systems.},

abstract = {Robots that can easily interact with humans and move through natural environments are becoming\r\nincreasingly essential as assistive devices in the home, office and hospital. These machines need to be\r\nsafe, effective, and easy to control. One strategy towards accomplishing these goals is to build the\r\nrobots using soft and flexible materials to make them much more approachable and less likely to\r\ndamage their environment. A major challenge is that comparatively little is known about how best to\r\ndesign, fabricate and control deformable machines. Here we describe the design, fabrication and\r\ncontrol of a novel soft robotic platform (Softworms) as a modular device for research, education and\r\npublic outreach. These robots are inspired by recent neuromechanical studies of crawling and\r\nclimbing by larval moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera, caterpillars). Unlike most soft robots currently\r\nunder development, the Softworms do not rely on pneumatic or fluidic actuators but are electrically\r\npowered and actuated using either shape-memory alloy microcoils or motor tendons, and they can be\r\nmodified to accept other muscle-like actuators such as electroactive polymers. The technology is\r\nextremely versatile, and different designs can be quickly and cheaply fabricated by casting elastomeric\r\npolymers or by direct 3D printing. Softworms can crawl, inch or roll, and they are steerable and even\r\nclimb steep inclines. Softworms can be made in any shape but here we describe modular and\r\nmonolithic designs requiring little assembly. These modules can be combined to make multi-limbed\r\ndevices.Wealso describe two approaches for controlling such highly deformable structures using\r\neither model-free state transition-reward matrices or distributed, mechanically coupled oscillators. In\r\naddition to their value as a research platform, these robots can be developed for use in environmental,\r\nmedical and space applications where cheap, lightweight and shape-changing deformable robots will\r\nprovide new performance capabilities.},

abstract = {Both postural maintenance and rhythm generation are keys to generating adaptive behavior in all animals. This is particularly evident in soft animals such as caterpillars, worm and flatworms that are capable of moving freely in all directions and adopting intricate postures. They can also exploit three-dimensional deformations and nonlinear structural properties to move in complex environments and to respond to external forces. These capabilities have inspired a new interest in using soft materials in robotic applications but highly deformable materials create significant design and control problems. In previous work the authors have developed a 3D-printed soft (3D-PS) robot, inspired by caterpillars, as a platform to investigate methods for controlling soft robots. The previous version of the robot is able to reproduce the different gait patterns (inching and crawling motion) of caterpillars by changing temporal difference in the rhythmic deformations of different body parts. In this paper, we have added posture control to the 3D-PS robot together with a steering capability. Experimental results show that although posture and steering are usually related, elastic and continuum properties of the soft body can produce more complex and versatile behaviors.},

abstract = {We explore the relation between spatial thinking and performance and attainment in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) domains. Spatial skills strongly predict who will go into STEM fields. But why is this true? We argue that spatial skills serve as a gateway or barrier for entry into STEM fields. We review literature that indicates that psychometrically-assessed spatial abilities predict performance early in STEM learning, but become less predicative as students advance toward expertise. Experts often have mental representations that allow them to solve problems without having to use spatial thinking. For example, an expert chemist who knows a great deal about the structure and behavior of a particular molecule may not need to mentally rotate a representation of this molecule in order to make a decision about it. Novices who have low levels of spatial skills may not be able to advance to the point at which spatial skills become less important. Thus, a program of spatial training might help to increase the number of people who go into STEM fields. We review and give examples of work on spatial training, which show that spatial abilities are quite malleable. Our chapter helps to constrain and specify when and how spatial abilities do (or do not) matter in STEM thinking and learning.},

The 17,000 tactile units in this skin area of the human hand are of four different types: two fast adapting types, FA I and FA II (formerly RA and PC), and two slowly adapting types, SA I and SA II. The receptive field characteristics and the densities in the skin of the type I units (FA I and SA I) indicate that these account for the detailed spatial resolution that is of paramount importance for the motor skill and the explorative role of the hand. The relationship between the stimulus amplitude and perceived intensity during sustained skin indentations did not match the corresponding stimulus response functions of SA units suggesting non-linear transformations within the central nervous system. These transformations, in turn, appear to vary between subjects. A single impulse in a single FA I unit may be felt when originating from the most important tactile regions of the hand, indicating that the psychophysical detection may be set by the threshold of the sense organs. Moreover, no significant noise seems to be superimposed in the respective central sensory pathways.},

abstract = {Landing behavior is one of the most critical, yet least
studied, aspects of insect flight. In order to land safely, an
insect must recognize a visual feature, navigate towards it,
decelerate, and extend its legs in preparation for touchdown.
Although previous studies have focused on the visual stimuli
that trigger these different components, the complete sequence
has not been systematically studied in a free-flying animal.
Using a real-time 3D tracking system in conjunction with high
speed digital imaging, we were able to capture the landing
sequences of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) from the
moment they first steered toward a visual target, to the point
of touchdown. This analysis was made possible by a
custom-built feedback system that actively maintained the fly
in the focus of the high speed camera. The results suggest
that landing is composed of three distinct behavioral modules.
First, a fly actively turns towards a stationary target via a
directed body saccade. Next, it begins to decelerate at a
point determined by both the size of the visual target and its
rate of expansion on the retina. Finally, the fly extends its
legs when the visual target reaches a threshold retinal size
of approximately 60 deg. Our data also let us compare landing
sequences with flight trajectories that, although initially
directed toward a visual target, did not result in landing. In
these `fly-by' trajectories, flies steer toward the target but
then exhibit a targeted aversive saccade when the target
subtends a retinal size of approximately 33 deg. Collectively,
the results provide insight into the organization of
sensorimotor modules that underlie the landing and search
behaviors of insects.},

Minor differences were detected in stride length and in the delay between crawls, which led to a lower crawling speed in the vertical orientation. Although these differences were statistically significant, they were much smaller than the variation in kinematic parameters between animals. The ability of Manduca to crawl and climb using the same movements is best explained by Manduca's relatively small size, slow speed and strong, controlled, passive grip made possible by its proleg/crochets.},

abstract = {In this paper a rotational actuator with a novel adaptable compliance (inverse of stiffness) is presented. First, a number of comparable designs are given with their possible drawbacks. The MACCEPA concept and design is then described in detail. The equation to calculate the generated torque is derived. Depending on the design parameters, it is shown that the torque is a quasi linear function with respect to the angle between the equilibrium position and the actual position. Also, the change of the pre-tension has a quasi linear effect on the torque. Another advantage is that the actuator can be built with standard components, e.g. electrical servo motors. Experiments show independent control of the equilibrium position and compliance. The use of the MACCEPA in the Controlled Passive Walking biped Veronica is described. Controlled Passive Walking is an approach that combines the advantages of actively controlled robots and passive walkers. By adapting the compliance of the joints, natural motions can be chosen in order to obtain a controllable and energy efficient walking motion. To test the concept, the biped Veronica is built, actuated by six MACCEPAs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this review, we compare and discuss prominent aspects of these alternative strategies, and demonstrate for selected examples that nanoscale-precision biotemplating is able to produce uncommon mechanical properties as well as actuating behavior, resembling to some extent the properties of the original natural templates. We present and discuss mechanical testing data showing for the first time that nanometer-precision biotemplating can lead to porous ceramic materials with deformation characteristics commonly associated with either biological or highly advanced technical materials. We also review recent findings on the relation between hierarchical structuring and humidity-induced directional motion. Finally, we discuss to which extent the observed behavior is in agreement with previous results and theories on the mechanical properties of multiscale hierarchical materials, as well as studies of highly disperse technical materials, together with an outlook for further lines of investigation.},

The main classes are active impedance by control, inherent compliance and damping actuators, inertial actuators, and combinations of them, which are then further divided into subclasses.

abstract = {Manipulation using dextrous robot hands has been an exciting yet frustrating research topic for the last several years. While significant progress has occurred in the design, construction, and low level control of robotic hands, researchers are up against fundamental problems in developing algorithms for real-time computations in multi-sensory processing and motor control. The aim of this book is to explore parallels in sensorimotor integration in dextrous robot and human hands, addressing the basic question of how the next generation of dextrous hands should evolve. By bringing together experimental psychologists, kinesiologists, computer scientists, electrical engineers, and mechanical engineers, the book covers topics that range from human hand usage in prehension and exploration, to the design and use of robotic sensors and multi-fingered hands, and to control and computational architectures for dextrous hand usage. While the ultimate goal of capturing human hand versatility remains elusive, this book makes an important contribution to the design and control of future dextrous robot hands through a simple underlying message: a topic as complex as dextrous manipulation would best be addressed by collaborative, interdisciplinary research, combining high level and low level views, drawing parallels between human studies and analytic approaches, and integrating sensory data with motor commands. As seen in this text, success has been made through the establishment of such collaborative efforts. The future will hold up to expectations only as researchers become aware of advances in parallel fields and as a common vocabulary emerges from integrated perceptions about manipulation.},

The . Abstract Curved - line folding is the act of folding a flat sheet of material along a curved crease pattern in order to create a 3D shape , using the combination of folding (plastic deformation) and bending (elastic deformation) . Most applications of curved - line folding only make use of the end state of the folding process : a static solution obtained through folding along a curved crease pattern . However , the elastic deformations that occur when a flat sheet is forced into a curved shape can produce an interesting transformation process . When one surface area is bent , the forces and moments are transmitted through the curved creases to the adjacent surface areas , which results in a folding motion . As a result , this kind of transformation process could be used for the development of a new type of deployable structure , finding its application in the context of kinetic shading systems . The aim of this paper is to give an overview of how this transformation process can be modelled and analysed in a digital environment . Existing methods as well as some new approaches are discussed and evaluated . A distinction is made between pure geometrical modelling methods and simulations with finite elements software . It can be concluded that the existing tools for geometrical modelling of the folding process of deployable structures based on curved - line folding are sufficient to quickly check the deployment of different curved - line folding patterns and can find their application in the early design stage . However , for a more profound analysis , which takes into account material properties and forces , a calculation with finite elements is required .},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel analytical-based kinematic and dynamic modeling and control approach is developed for reference speed tracking of a multijoint robotic fish. The kinematic model is improved by the introduction of input signal for controlling body undulation amplitude without distorting the model structure. Next, the dynamic model is developed in the discrete-time domain primarily because fish swimming pattern generates oscillating continuous thrust where the effect of thrust over one cycle of undulation can be calculated through averaging. Hence, the dynamics can be discretized according to the undulation rate. The novelty in developing the discrete-time dynamical model is three fold. First, the thrust gradient is derived with assistance of Lighthill's large amplitude elongated body theory. More importantly, affine-in-control dynamical model form, essential for designing a real-time model-based control algorithm, is derived by inclusion of the updated kinematic model. Second, the thrust delay is studied via pulse input response of the motion system, and incorporated in the dynamical model. Third, drag force coefficient calculation is also proposed by comparing the thrust model and empirically recorded steady-state speeds of the robotic fish. Finally, discrete-time model-based sliding-mode control (SMC) is designed for speed tracking. Experimental results verify that SMC based on the proposed dynamical model, can significantly improve speed tracking performance of a multilink robotic fish. {\textcopyright}1982-2012 IEEE.},

The aim of counterweight balancing is to reduce this vibration by adding counterweights on the moving mechanism links. This paper shows that, even for the complicated case of spatial mechanisms, finding the counterweight parameters that result in minimal forces and moments under constrained driving torque is an optimization problem that can be reformulated as a convex problem. This reformulation uses voxel-based discretizations, inspired by the typical discretizations used in the area of topology optimization, and results in counterweight shapes that can easily be implemented in practice. The advantages of the proposed methodology in terms of computation time, balancing result and practicality of the counterweights are demonstrated using a literature benchmark consisting of a RSSR - spatial fourbar mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Vertebrates swimming with undulations of the body and tail have inflection points where the curvature of the body changes from concave to convex or vice versa. These inflection points travel down the body at the speed of the running wave of bending. In movements with increasing amplitudes, the body rotates around the inflection points, inducing semicircular flows in the adjacent water on both sides of the body that together form proto-vortices. Like the inflection points, the proto-vortices travel towards the end of the tail. In the experiments described here, the phase relationship between the tailbeat cycle and the inflection point cycle can be used as a first approximation of the phase between the proto-vortex and the tailbeat cycle. Proto-vortices are shed at the tail as body vortices at roughly the same time as the inflection points reach the tail tip. Thus, the phase between proto-vortex shedding and tailbeat cycle determines the interaction between body and tail vortices, which are shed when the tail changes direction. The shape of the body wave is under the control of the fish and determines the position of vortex shedding relative to the mean path of motion. This, in turn, determines whether and how the body vortex interacts with the tail vortex. The shape of the wake and the contribution of the body to thrust depend on this interaction between body vortex and tail vortex. So far, we have been able to describe two types of wake. One has two vortices per tailbeat where each vortex consists of a tail vortex enhanced by a body vortex. A second, more variable, type of wake has four vortices per tailbeat: two tail vortices and two body vortices shed from the tail tip while it is moving from one extreme position to the next. The function of the second type is still enigmatic.},

Foundry provides an interactive and visual process for hierarchically designing spatially-varying material properties (e.g., appearance, mechanical, optical). The result- ing meta-materials exhibit structure at the micro and macro level and can surpass the qualities of traditional composites. The material definitions are created by composing a set of operators into an operator graph. Each operator performs a volume decomposition operation, remaps space, or constructs and assigns a material composition. The operators are imple- mented using a domain-specific language for multi-material fabrication; users can easily extend the library by writing their own operators. Foundry can be used to build operator graphs that describe complex, parameterized, resolution-independent, and reusable material definitions. We also describe how to stage the evaluation of the final material definition which in conjunction with progressive refinement, allows for interac- tive material evaluation even for complex designs. We show sophisticated and functional parts designed with our system.},

abstract = {Recent work suggests that jumping locomotion in combination with a gliding phase can be used as an effective mobility principle in robotics. Compared to pure jumping without a gliding phase, the potential benefits of hybrid jump-gliding locomotion includes the ability to extend the distance travelled and reduce the potentially damaging impact forces upon landing. This publication evaluates the performance of jump-gliding locomotion and provides models for the analysis of the relevant dynamics of flight. It also defines a jump-gliding envelope that encompasses the range that can be achieved with jump-gliding robots and that can be used to evaluate the performance and improvement potential of jump-gliding robots. We present first a planar dynamic model and then a simplified closed form model, which allow for quantification of the distance travelled and the impact energy on landing. In order to validate the prediction of these models, we validate the model with experiments using a novel jump-gliding robot, named the 'EPFL jump-glider'. It has a mass of 16.5 g and is able to perform jumps from elevated positions, perform steered gliding flight, land safely and traverse on the ground by repetitive jumping. The experiments indicate that the developed jump-gliding model fits very well with the measured flight data using the EPFL jump-glider, confirming the benefits of jump-gliding locomotion to mobile robotics. The jump-glide envelope considerations indicate that the EPFL jump-glider, when traversing from a 2 m height, reaches 74.3% of optimal jump-gliding distance compared to pure jumping without a gliding phase which only reaches 33.4% of the optimal jump-gliding distance. Methods of further improving flight performance based on the models and inspiration from biological systems are presented providing mechanical design pathways to future jump-gliding robot designs.},

In both experiments, substantially the same sets of usability problems were found in the low- and high- fidelity conditions. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between the proportion of subjects detecting particular problems in the low- and high-fidelity groups. In other words, individual problems were detected by a similar proportion of subjects in both the low- and high-fidelity conditions.

abstract = {Variable stiffness actuators are a particular class of actuators that is characterized by the property that the apparent output stiffness can be changed independent of the output position. To achieve this, variable stiffness actuators consist of a number of elastic elements and a number of actuated degrees of freedom, which determine how the elastic elements are perceived at the actuator output. Changing the apparent output stiffness is useful for a broad range of applications, which explains the increasing research interest in this class of actuators. In this paper, a generic, port-based model for variable stiffness actuators is presented, with which a wide variety of designs can be modeled and analyzed. From the analysis of the model, it is possible to derive kinematic properties that variable stiffness actuator designs should satisfy in order to be energy efficient. More specifically, the kinematics should be such that the apparent output stiffness can be varied without changing the potential energy that is stored in the internal elastic elements. A concept design of an energy-efficient variable stiffness actuator is presented and implemented. Simulations of the model and experiments on the realized prototype validate the design principle. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Underwater robot is a new research field which is emerging quickly in recent years. Previous researches in this field focus on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), underwater manipulators, etc. Fish robot, which is a new type of underwater biomimetic robot, has attracted great attention because of its silence in moving and energy efficiency compared to conventional propeller-oriented propulsive mechanism. However, most of researches on fish robots have been carried out via empirical or experimental approaches, not based on dynamic optimality. In this paper, we proposed an analytical optimization approach which can guarantee the maximum propulsive velocity of fish robot in the given parametric conditions. First, a dynamic model of 3-joint (4 links) carangiform fish robot is derived, using which the influences of parameters of input torque functions, such as amplitude, frequency and phase difference, on its velocity are investigated by simulation. Second, the maximum velocity of the fish robot is optimized by combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Hill Climbing Algorithm (HCA). GA is used to generate the initial optimal parameters of the input functions of the system. Then, the parameters are optimized again by HCA to ensure that the final set of parameters is the "near" global optimization. Finally, both simulations and primitive experiments are carried out to prove the feasibility of the proposed method. {\textcopyright}2009 Jilin University.},

abstract = {Many types of bacteria swim by rotating a bundle of helical filaments also called flagella. Each filament is driven by a rotary motor and a very flexible hook transmits the motor torque to the filament. We model it by discretizing Kirchhoff's elastic-rod theory and develop a coarse-grained approach for driving the helical filament by a motor torque. A rotating flagellum generates a thrust force, which pushes the cell body forward and which increases with the motor torque. We fix the rotating flagellum in space and show that it buckles under the thrust force at a critical motor torque. Buckling becomes visible as a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in the thrust force. A second buckling transition occurs at an even higher motor torque. We attach the flagellum to a spherical cell body and also observe the first buckling transition during locomotion. By changing the size of the cell body, we vary the necessary thrust force and thereby obtain a characteristic relation between the critical thrust force and motor torque. We present a sophisticated analytical model for the buckling transition based on a helical rod which quantitatively reproduces the critical force-torque relation. Real values for motor torque, cell body size, and the geometry of the helical filament suggest that buckling should occur in single bacterial flagella. We also find that the orientation of pulling flagella along the driving torque is not stable and comment on the biological relevance for marine bacteria.},

Its first practical demonstration took place in Japan in 1984, at Waseda University, Laboratory of Ichiro Kato, in the first dynamically balanced robot WL-10RD of the robotic family WABOT. The paper gives an in-depth discussion of source results concerning ZMP, paying particular attention to some delicate issues that may lead to confusion if this method is applied in a mechanistic manner onto irregular cases of artificial gait, i.e. in the case of loss of dynamic balance of a humanoid robot.

abstract = {We introduce the concept of many-to-one mapping of form to function and suggest that this emergent property of complex systems promotes the evolution of physiological diversity. Our work has focused on a 4-bar linkage found in labrid fish jaws that transmits muscular force and motion from the lower jaw to skeletal elements in the upper jaws. Many different 4-bar shapes produce the same amount of output rotation in the upper jaw per degree of lower jaw rotation, a mechanical property termed Maxillary KT. We illustrate three consequences of many-to-one mapping of 4-bar shape to Maxillary KT. First, many-to-one mapping can partially decouple morphological and mechanical diversity within clades. We found with simulations of 4-bars evolving on phylogenies of 500 taxa that morphological and mechanical diversity were only loosely correlated (R(2) = 0.25). Second, redundant mapping permits the simultaneous optimization of more than one mechanical property of the 4-bar. Labrid fishes have capitalized on this flexibility, as illustrated by several species that have Maxillary KT = 0.8 but have different values of a second property, Nasal KT. Finally, many-to-one mapping may increase the influence of historical factors in determining the evolution of morphology. Using a genetic model of 4-bar evolution we exerted convergent selection on three different starting 4-bar shapes and found that mechanical convergence only created morphological convergence in simulations where the starting forms were similar. Many-to-one mapping is widespread in physiological systems and operates at levels ranging from the redundant mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, up to the morphological basis of whole-organism performance. This phenomenon may be involved in the uneven distribution of functional diversity seen among animal lineages.},

abstract = {Why do some animals swim by rowing appendages back and forth while others fly by flapping them up and down? One hypothesis suggests the answer lies in the sharply divergent physical environments encountered by small, slow animals, and large, fast animals. Flapping appendages allow large animals to move through a fluid environment quickly and efficiently. As size and speed decrease, however, viscous drag increasingly dominates the force balance, with negative consequences for both rowing and flapping appendages. Nevertheless, comparative data suggest that flapping does not occur in animals at Reynolds numbers (Re) less than about 15. I used a computer simulation experiment to address the question, “Below what Re is rowing more effective than flapping?” The simulation, which employed a simple quasi-steady, blade-element model of virtual oscillating appendages, has several important results. First, the mechanical efficiency of both rowing and flapping decrease dramatically with scale. Second, the performance of rowing can increase substantially by taking advantage of several dynamic shape modifications, including area and span reduction during the recovery stroke. Finally, the relative performance of rowing and flapping is dependent on the advance ratio, which is a function of the travel speed relative to the oscillation frequency. The model predicts that rowing is more efficient than flapping at Re < 20 for animals moving throughout the range of typically observed advance ratios.},

This experiment compared user testing with low- and high-fidelity prototypes in both computer and paper media. Task-based user tests of sketched (low-fidelity) and HTML (high-fidelity) website prototypes were conducted in each medium, separating the testing medium from other factors of prototype fidelity. We found that low- and high-fidelity prototypes are equally good at uncovering usability issues. Usability testing results were also found to be independent of medium, despite differences in interaction style. Designers should choose whichever medium and level of fidelity suit their practical needs and design goals, as discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Here, we present a detailed analysis of the wing kinematics and wing deformations of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria, Forsk{\aa}l) flying tethered in a wind tunnel. We filmed them using four high-speed digital video cameras, and used photogrammetry to reconstruct the motion of more than 100 identified points. Whereas the hindwing motions were highly stereotyped, the forewing motions showed considerable variation, consistent with a role in flight control. Both wings were positively cambered on the downstroke. The hindwing was cambered through an 'umbrella effect' whereby the trailing edge tension compressed the radial veins during the downstroke. Hindwing camber was reversed on the upstroke as the wing fan corrugated, reducing the projected area by 30 per cent, and releasing the tension in the trailing edge. Both the wings were strongly twisted from the root to the tip. The linear decrease in incidence along the hindwing on the downstroke precisely counteracts the linear increase in the angle of attack that would otherwise occur in root flapping for an untwisted wing. The consequent near-constant angle of attack is reminiscent of the optimum for a propeller of constant aerofoil section, wherein a linear twist distribution allows each section to operate at the unique angle of attack maximizing the lift to drag ratio. This implies tuning of the structural, morphological and kinematic parameters of the hindwing for efficient aerodynamic force production.},

abstract = {This note discusses multi-sensor fusion. Through sensor fusion we may combine readings from different sensors, remove inconsistencies and combine the information into one coherent structure. This kind of processing is a fundamental feature of all animal and human navigation, where multiple information sources such as vision, hearing and balance are combined to determine position and plan a path to a goal. While the concept of data fusion is not new, the emergence of new sensors, advanced processing techniques, and improved processing hardware make real-time fusion of data increasingly possible. Despite advances in electronic components, however, developing data processing applications such as automatic guidance systems has proved difficult. Systems that are in direct contact and interact with the real world, require reliable and accurate information about their environment. This information is acquired using sensors, that is devices that collect data about the world around them. The ability of one isolated device to provide accurate reliable data of its environment is extremely limited as the environment is usually not very well defined in addition to sensors generally not being a very reliable interface. Sensor fusion seeks to overcome the drawbacks of current sensor technology by combining information from many independent sources of limited accuracy and reliability to give information of better accuracy and reliability. This makes the system less vulnerable to failures of a single component and generally provide more accurate information. In addition several readings from the same sensor are combined, making the system less sensitive to noise and anomalous observations},

abstract = {There exists a large body of research devoted to creating real time interactive locomotion controllers which are targeted at some specific class of character, most often humanoid bipeds. Relatively little work, however, has been done on approaches which are applicable to creatures with a wide range of different forms – partially due to the lack of easily obtainable motion-capture data for animals and fictional creatures. We show how a locomotion controller can be created despite this dearth of data by synthesizing it from scratch. Our method only requires as input a description of the shape of the animal, the gaits which it can perform, and a model of the task or tasks for which the controller will be used. From this a sequence of motion clips are automatically synthesized and assembled into a motion graph which defines a physically realistic controller capable of performing the specified tasks. The method attempts to minimize the computational time required to generate this controller and we show its effectiveness at creating interactive controllers for a range of tasks for bipeds, tripeds, and quadrupeds.},

abstract = {Soft robots outperform the conventional hard robots on significantly enhanced safety, adaptability, and complex motions. The development of fully soft robots, especially fully from smart soft materials to mimic soft animals, is still nascent. In addition, to date, existing soft robots cannot adapt themselves to the surrounding environment, i.e., sensing and adaptive motion or response, like animals. Here, compliant ultrathin sensing and actuating electronics innervated fully soft robots that can sense the environment and perform soft bodied crawling adaptively, mimicking an inchworm, are reported. The soft robots are constructed with actuators of open-mesh shaped ultrathin deformable heaters, sensors of single-crystal Si optoelectronic photodetectors, and thermally responsive artificial muscle of carbon-black-doped liquid-crystal elastomer (LCE-CB) nanocomposite. The results demonstrate that adaptive crawling locomotion can be realized through the conjugation of sensing and actuation, where the sensors sense the environment and actuators respond correspondingly to control the locomotion autonomously through regulating the deformation of LCE-CB bimorphs and the locomotion of the robots. The strategy of innervating soft sensing and actuating electronics with artificial muscles paves the way for the development of smart autonomous soft robots.},

Here we propose the concept of robotic ribbon folding including a general workflow from shape design to ribbon folding and shape retention. We also propose a method to realize robotic ribbon folding on the macroscopic scale. The method consists of minimally engineered ribbons with patterned flexures, a folding robot, and a folding scheme that relates the orientation of flexures, the type of folds and the type of structural elements. By using this method we demonstrate robotic ribbon folding into 2D static structures such as triangles and squares, 3D static structures, and planar kinematic linkages such as a simple non-crossing four-bar mechanism. Burn-in result shows a four-bar mechanism with all bars' length of 5 cm could move repeatedly for at least half an hour.},

This paper proposes a finite element-based approach for modeling heterogeneous parts to facilitate rapid prototyping. In this approach, traditional geometrical and topological data are blended with materials information in the CAD model. It builds on a CAD system to create parts' geometry which is then subdivided into a set of tetrahedral finite elements. With this, the design problem of material distribution in the whole body can be handled at the finite element level. The material composition of each point inside a finite element is formulated in terms of four control nodes of the finite element and a blending function. Moreover, design rules for modeling heterogeneous parts are introduced in the paper, making the modeling solution more robust. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A bioinspired hybrid hydrogel actuator was designed and prepared by series combination of three trunks of tough polymer-clay hydrogels to accomplish the comprehensive actuation of "extension-grasp-retraction" like a fishing rod. The hydrogels with thermo-creep and thermo-shrinking features were successively irradiated by near-infrared (NIR) to execute extension and retraction, respectively. The GO in the hydrogels absorbed the NIR energy and transformed it into thermo-energy rapidly and effectively. The hydrogel with adhesion or magnetic force was adopted as the "hook" of the hybrid hydrogel actuator for grasping object. The hook of the hybrid hydrogel actuator was replaceable according to applications, even with functional materials other than hydrogels. This study provides an innovative concept to explore new soft actuators through combining response hydrogels and programming the same stimulus.},

abstract = {Soft pneumatic actuators and motor-based mechanisms being concomitant with the cumbersome appendages have many challenges to making the independent robotic system with compact and lightweight configuration. Meanwhile, shape memory actuators have shown a promising alternative solution in many engineering applications ranging from artificial muscle to aerospace industry. However, one of the main limitations of such systems is their inherent softness resulting in a small actuation force, which prevents them from more effective applications. This issue can be solved by combining shape memory actuators and the mechanism of stiffness modulation. As a first, this study describes a shape memory alloy-based soft gripper composed of three identical fingers with variable stiffness for adaptive grasping in low stiffness state and effective holding in high stiffness state. Each finger with two hinges is fabricated through integrating soft composite actuator with stiffness changeable material where each hinge can approximately achieve a 55-fold changeable stiffness independently. Besides, each finger with two hinges can actively achieve multiple postures by both selectively changing the stiffness of hinges and actuating the relevant SMA wire. Based on these principles, the gripper is applicable for grasping objects with deformable shapes and varying shapes with a large range of weight where its maximum grasping force is increased to ∼10 times through integrating with the stiffness changeable mechanism. The final demonstration shows that the finger with desired shape-retained configurations enables the gripper to successfully pick up a frustum-shaped object.},

During a collision, impulsive forces may dominate all other forces, and determine the ultimate success or failure of a task. More effective planning and control of manipulators should be possible if the impact process, including the effects of friction and elasticity, is better understood. This paper explores the planar impact of two objects, and develops simple graphical methods for predicting the mode of contact, the total impulse, and the resultant motions of the objects. In the special case of a perfectly plastic collision, the fundamental motion of the object-whether an angular acceleration will occur, and if so in what direction-is the same as predicted in earlier work on quasi-static pushing.},

abstract = {We compare computational, experimental and quasi-steady forces in a generic hovering wing undergoing sinusoidal motion along a horizontal stroke plane. In particular, we investigate unsteady effects and compare two-dimensional (2D) computations and three-dimensional (3D) experiments in several qualitatively different kinematic patterns. In all cases, the computed drag compares well with the experiments. The computed lift agrees in the cases in which the sinusoidal changes in angle of attack are symmetrical or advanced with respect to stroke positions, but lags behind the measured 3D lift in the delayed case. In the range of amplitudes studied here, 3-5 chords, the force coefficients have a weak dependence on stroke amplitude. As expected, the forces are sensitive to the phase between stroke angle and angle of attack, a result that can be explained by the orientation of the wing at reversal. This dependence on amplitude and phase suggests a simple maneuver strategy that could be used by a flapping wing device. In all cases the unsteady forces quickly reach an almost periodic state with continuous flapping. The fluid forces are dominated by the pressure contribution. The force component directly proportional to the linear acceleration is smaller by a factor proportional to the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; its net contribution is zero in hovering. The ratio of wing inertia and fluid force is proportional to the product of the ratio of wing and fluid density and the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; it is negligible in the robotic wing experiment, but need not be in insect flight. To identify unsteady effects associated with wing acceleration, and coupling between rotation and translation, as well as wake capture, we examine the difference between the unsteady forces and the estimates based on translational velocities, and compare them against the estimate of the coupling between rotation and translation, which have simple analytic forms for sinusoidal motions. The agreement and disagreement between the computed forces and experiments offer further insight into when the 3D effects are important. A main difference between a 3D revolving wing and a 2D translating wing is the absence of vortex shedding by a revolving wing over a distance much longer than the typical stroke length of insects. No doubt such a difference in shedding dynamics is responsible in part for the differences in steady state force coefficients measured in 2D and 3D. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such differences would have a significant effect on transient force coefficients before the onset of shedding. While the 2D steady state force coefficients underpredict 3D forces, the transient 2D forces measured prior to shedding are much closer to the 3D forces. In the cases studied here, the chord is moving between 3 to 5 chords, typical of hovering insect stroke length, and the flow does not appear to separate during each stroke in the cases of advanced and symmetrical rotation. In these cases, the wing reverses before the leading edge vortex would have time to separate even in 2D. This suggests that the time scale for flow separation in these strokes is dictated by the flapping frequency, which is dimensionally independent. In such cases, the 2D unsteady forces turn out to be good approximations of 3D experiments.},

abstract = {We introduce Embodied Evolution (EE) as a new methodology for evolutionary robotics (ER). EE uses a population of physical robots that autonomously reproduce with one another while situated in their task environment. This constitutes a fully distributed evolutionary algorithm embodied in physical robots. Several issues identified by researchers in the evolutionary robotics community as problematic for the development of ER are alleviated by the use of a large number of robots being evaluated in parallel. Particularly, EE avoids the pitfalls of the simulate-and-transfer method and allows the speed-up of evaluation time by utilizing parallelism. The more novel features of EE are that the evolutionary algorithm is entirely decentralized, which makes it inherently scalable to large numbers of robots, and that it uses many robots in a shared task environment, which makes it an interesting platform for future work in collective robotics and Artificial Life. We have built a population of eight robots and successfully implemented the first example of Embodied Evolution by designing a fully decentralized, asynchronous evolutionary algorithm. Controllers evolved by EE outperform a hand-designed controller in a simple application. We introduce our approach and its motivations, detail our implementation and initial results, and discuss the advantages and limitations of EE. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Particle Jamming has been demonstrated to be very effective for soft robotic arms with stiffness modulation by pneumatic means. However, the structural uncertainty due to particle re-organization makes particle jamming based soft robotic arms unreliable in both position and stiffness control. Ball joint based robotic arms have good structural integrity and good positional control property. Yet their stiffness modulation is very difficult. Instead of modulating stiffness using wires, this research proposes stiffness modulation of ball joint based robotic spines using vacuum energy. To strengthen the spine arm stiffness, particles are integrated into the ball joint spine. Both analysis and experimental studies in this research have shown that the integrated robotic spine has much better performance in terms of stiffness compared to the ball joint based spine without particle jamming. In fact, experimental studies have shown stiffness enhancement of 13 times. The proposed soft robotic spine can be used in applications where a large band of stiffness modulation is required.},

abstract = {Because humans have limited ability to independently control the many joints of the hand, a wide variety of hand shapes can be characterized as a weighted combination of just two or three main patterns of covariation in joint rotations, or "postural synergies." The present study sought to align muscle synergies with these main postural synergies and to describe the form of membership of motor units in these postural/muscle synergies. Seventeen joint angles and the electromyographic (EMG) activities of several hand muscles (both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles) were recorded while human subjects held the hand statically in 52 specific shapes (i.e., shaping the hand around 26 commonly grasped objects or forming the 26 letter shapes of a manual alphabet). Principal-components analysis revealed several patterns of muscle synergy, some of which represented either coactivation of all hand muscles, or reciprocal patterns of activity (above and below average levels) in the intrinsic index finger and thumb muscles or (to a lesser extent) in the extrinsic four-tendoned extensor and flexor muscles. Single- and multiunit activity was generally a multimodal function of whole hand shape. This implies that motor-unit activation does not align with a single synergy; instead, motor units participate in multiple muscle synergies. Thus it appears that the organization of the global pattern of hand muscle activation is highly distributed. This organization mirrors the highly fractured somatotopy of cortical hand representations and may provide an ideal substrate for motor learning and recovery from injury.},

abstract = {Environmentally responsive (ER) hydrogels are hydrogels that can experience an abrupt volume change and hence hold or release a large amount of water under the change of certain environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, or an electric field. Because of their unique capability to achieve a large yet reversible volume change, hydrogels have been widely used in microfluidics and biomedical applications, such as hydrogel sensors and actuators for microfluidic channels, novel drug delivery systems, and scaffolding materials for tissue engineering. In most applications, ER hydrogels are used to create an isotropic volume change or one-dimensional motion by constraining the hydrogel in the other two directions. In this study, using finite element based simulations, actuator designs are demonstrated that can generate a variety of shape changes by carefully patterning ER hydrogels on a non-ER hydrogel matrix. In these designs, as the environment changes, the ER hydrogels undergo volume change under the constraints imposed by the non-ER matrix, causing an eigenstrain (mismatch strain) and hence the deformation of the non-ER matrix. By properly controlling the locations of the ER hydrogel sections with respect to the non-ER hydrogel matrix, one can achieve a desired deformation of the composite structure. As examples, designs of a single material actuator, one linear spring composite actuator, and two coil composite actuators are demonstrated. The feasibility to produce these actuators and the possible applications are discussed at the end of the article.},

abstract = {The evolution of feeding mechanisms in the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) is a compelling example of transformation in a musculoskeletal complex involving multiple skeletal elements and numerous muscles that power skull motion. Biomechanical models of jaw force and skull kinetics aid our understanding of these complex systems and enable broad comparison of feeding mechanics across taxa. Mechanical models characterize how muscles move skeletal elements by pulling bones around points of rotation in lever mechanisms, or by transmitting force through skeletal elements connected in a linkage. Previous work has focused on the feeding biomechanics of several lineages of fishes, but a broader survey of skull function in the context of quantitative models has not been attempted. This study begins such a survey by examining the diversity of mechanical design of the oral jaws in 35 species of ray-finned fishes with three main objectives: (1) analyze lower jaw lever models in a broad phylogenetic range of taxa, (2) identify the origin and evolutionary patterns of change in the linkage systems that power maxillary rotation and upper jaw protrusion, and (3) analyze patterns of change in feeding design in the context of actinopterygian phylogeny. The mandibular lever is present in virtually all actinopterygians, and the diversity in lower jaw closing force transmission capacity, with mechanical advantage ranging from 0.04 to 0.68, has important functional consequences. A four-bar linkage for maxillary rotation arose in the Amiiformes and persists in various forms in many teleost species. Novel mechanisms for upper jaw protrusion based on this linkage for maxillary rotation have evolved independently at least five times in teleosts. The widespread anterior jaws linkage for jaw protrusion in percomorph fishes arose initially in Zeiformes and subsequently radiated into a wide range of premaxillary protrusion capabilities.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe the fabrication and testing of elastomer-based sensors capable of measuring both uniaxial strain and curvature. These sensors were fabricated from Sylgard 184, which is a transparent silicone elastomer. We created microchannels directly in silicone elastomer substrates using a laser to ablate material. The sensing element was an alloy of gallium and indium, which is liquid at room temperature, contained within the laser-created microchannels. As the substrate deformed, the microchannel deformed within it, resulting in a measurable change in electrical resistance. By fabricating two matching resistive strain-sensing elements on opposite sides of the sensor, we were able to unambiguously measure uniaxial strain and curvature by observing the common mode and differential mode changes in resistance, respectively. There was very little coupling between modes, demonstrating the utility of the differential sensor design. We characterized the sensor in terms of its response to strain and curvature, its noise, and its stability over time. We believe that this type of sensor has application in soft sensory skins and can observe pose in soft robotic systems.},

Rather than developing smaller actuators, the main actuator is removed entirely. Energy instead comes from the environment to provide motion in prescribed synchronous ways. Prescribed synchronous motions allow much faster assembly times than random Brownian motion which has been used before. An instantiation of this idea is presented using a motion platform to induce motions based on the inertial properties of the modules and the timed actuation of small latching mechanisms.},

abstract = {We describe a miniaturized infrared camera mounted on a remotely operated platform (burrow probe system) that we developed to investigate spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) cubs while still in their natal dens. In conjunction with the burrow probe system, we used a hook system to retrieve carcasses from within burrows. To test the utility of these systems, we compared results obtained using the burrow probe and hook to results obtained from intensive above-ground monitoring alone. With the probe, we documented births and litter sizes at significantly younger ages than with above-ground monitoring. The probe was instrumental in detecting cubs that died prior to emergence from the natal den. Retrieval of carcasses allowed collection of genetic samples and data on sex and cause of death. Thus, the burrow probe and hook systems can provide scientists and managers with empirical data on productivity and neonatal mortality of carnivores in the wild; data essential to accurately monitor and model population trends.},

@article{Wilga1999,
abstract = {Pectoral tins are one of the major features of locomotor design in ray-tinned fishes and exhibit a well-documented phylogenetic transition from basal to derived clades. In percomorph fishes, the pectoral fins are often used to generate propulsive force via oscillatory movements, and pectoral fin propulsion in this relatively derived clade has been analyzed extensively. However, in the plesiomorphic pectoral fin condition, exemplified by sturgeon, pectoral fins extend laterally from the body in a generally horizontal orientation, have been assumed to generate lift to balance lift forces and moments produced by the heterocercal tail, and are not oscillated to generate propulsive force. The proposal that pectoral fins in fishes such as sturgeon generate lift during horizontal locomotion has never been tested experimentally in freely swimming fishes. In this paper, we examine the function of pectoral fins in sturgeon swimming at speeds from 0.5-3.0 L s-1, where L is total body length. Sturgeon were studied during steady horizontal locomotion as well as while sinking and rising in the water column. Pectoral fin function was quantified using three-dimensional kinematics to measure the orientation of the fin surface, digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) was used to describe flow in the wake of the fin and to estimate force exerted on the water, and electromyography was used to assess pectoral fin muscle function. Sturgeon (size range 25-32 cm total length) swam horizontally using continuous undulations of the body with a positive body angle that decreased from a mean of 20°at 0.5 L s-1 to 0°at 3.0 L s-1. Both the angle of the body and the pectoral tin surface angle changed significantly when sturgeon moved vertically in the water column. Three-dimensional kinematic analysis showed that during steady horizontal swimming the pectoral fins are oriented with a negative angle of attack predicted to generate no significant lift. This result was confirmed by DPIV analysis of the pectoral fin wake, which only revealed fin vortices, and hence force generation, during maneuvering. The orientation of the pectoral fins estimated by a two-dimensional analysis alone is greatly in error and may have contributed to previous suggestions that the pectoral fins are oriented to generate lift. Combined electromyographic and kinematic data showed that the posterior half of the pectoral fin is actively moved as a flap to reorient the head and body to initiate rising and sinking movements. A new force balance for swimming sturgeon is proposed for steady swimming and vertical maneuvering. During steady locomotion, the pectoral fins generate no lift and the positive body angle to the flow is used both to generate lift and to balance moments around the center of mass. To initiate rising or sinking, the posterior portion of the pectoral fins is actively moved ventrally or dorsally, respectively, initiating a starting vortex that, in turn, induces a pitching moment reorienting the body in the flow. Adjustments to body angle initiated by the pectoral fins serve as the primary means by which moments are balanced.},

abstract = {There are many notional systems for excavating lunar regolith in NASA's Exploration Vision. Quantitative system performance comparisons are scarce in the literature. This paper focuses on the required forces for excavation and traction as quantitative predictors of system feasibility. The rich history of terrestrial soil mechanics is adapted to extant lunar regolith parameters to calculate the forces. The soil mechanics literature often acknowledges the approximate results from the numerous excavation force models in use. An intent of this paper is to examine their variations in the lunar context. Six excavation models and one traction model are presented. The effects of soil properties are explored for each excavation model, for example, soil cohesion and friction, tool-soil adhesion, and soil density. Excavation operational parameters like digging depth, rake angle, gravity, and surcharge are examined. For the traction model, soil, operational, and machine design parameters are varied to probe choices. Mathematical anomalies are noted for several models. One conclusion is that the excavation models yield such disparate results that lunar-field testing is prudent. All the equations and graphs presented have been programmed for design use. Parameter ranges and units are included.},

abstract = {Compared with rigid objects, grasping and lifting compliant objects presents additional uncertainties. For any static grasp, forces at the fingertips depend on factors including the locations of the contact points and the contact forces must be coordinated to maintain equilibrium. For compliant objects, the locations and orientations of the contact surfaces change in a force-dependent manner, thus changing the force requirements. Furthermore, every force adjustment then results in additional changes in object shape. This study characterized force and muscle activation patterns in this situation. Fingertip forces were measured as subjects grasped and lifted a 200-g object using their thumb, index, and ring fingers. A spring was sometimes placed under the index and/or ring finger contact surface. Surface electromyographic activity was recorded from ten hand muscles and one proximal arm muscle. The patterns of grip (normal) force and muscle activity were similar across conditions during the load and lift phases, but their amplitude depended on whether the contact surface was compliant. Specifically, the grip force increased smoothly during the load phase of the task under all conditions. To the contrary, the tangential contact (load) force did not increase monotonically when one or more of the contact surfaces were compliant, resulting in a decoupling of the grip and load forces.},

abstract = {Estimates based on the strength, size, and shape of the Atlantic razor clam (Ensis directus) indicate that the animal's burrow depth should be physically limited to a few centimeters; yet razor clams can dig as deep as 70 cm. By measuring soil deformations around burrowing E. directus, we have found the animal reduces drag by contracting its valves to initially fail, and then fluidize, the surrounding substrate. The characteristic contraction time to achieve fluidization can be calculated directly from soil properties. The geometry of the fluidized zone is dictated by two commonly-measured geotechnical parameters: coefficient of lateral earth pressure and friction angle. Calculations using full ranges for both parameters indicate that the fluidized zone is a local effect, occurring between 1-5 body radii away from the animal. The energy associated with motion through fluidized substrate-characterized by a depth-independent density and viscosity-scales linearly with depth. In contrast, moving through static soil requires energy that scales with depth squared. For E. directus, this translates to a 10X reduction in the energy required to reach observed burrow depths. For engineers, localized fluidization offers a mechanically simple and purely kinematic method to dramatically reduce energy costs associated with digging. This concept is demonstrated with RoboClam, an E. directus-inspired robot. Using a genetic algorithm to find optimal digging kinematics, RoboClam has achieved localized fluidization burrowing performance comparable to that of the animal, with a linear energy-depth relationship, in both idealized granular glass beads and E. directus' native cohesive mudflat habitat.},

abstract = {Muscle measurements of Ensis directus, the Atlantic razor clam, indicate that the organism only has sufficient strength to burrow a few centimeters into the soil, yet razor clams burrow to over 70cm. In this paper, we show that the animal uses the motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding soil and reduce burrowing drag. Substrate deformations were measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a novel visualization system that enabled us to see through the soil and watch E. directus burrow in situ. PIV data, supported by soil and fluid mechanics theory, show that contraction of the valves of E. directus locally fluidizes the surrounding soil. Particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled as a Newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction. Using these models, we demonstrate that E. directus is strong enough to reach full burrow depth in fluidized soil, but not in static soil. Furthermore, we show that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static soil, and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than with depth squared.},

abstract = {In this article, we identify and analyze a subsea organism to serve as a model for biologically inspired burrowing technology to be used in applications such as anchoring, installation of cables, and recovery of oil. After inspecting myriad forms of life that live on or within ocean substrates, the Atlantic razor clam, Ensis directis, stood out as an attractive basis for new burrowing technology because of its low-energy requirements associated with digging (0.21 J/cm), its speed and depth of burrrowing (∼1 cm/s and 70 cm, respectively), and its size and simplicity relative to man-made machines. As anchoring is a prime application for the technology resulting from this work, the performance of an Ensis directus-based anchoring system was compared to existing technologies. In anchoring force per embedment energy, the E. directus-based anchor beats existing technology by at least an order of magnitude. In anchoring force per weight of device, the biologically inspired system weighs less than half that of current anchors. The article concludes with a review of E. directus's digging strategy, which involves motions of its valves to locally fluidize the substrate to reduce burrowing drag and energy, and the successful adaptation of E. directus's burrowing mechanisms into an engineering system: the RoboClam burrowing robot, which, like the animal, uses localized fluidization to achieve digging energy that scales linearly with depth, rather than depth squared, for moving through static soil.},

The nervous system is capable of adapting grip forces to a wide range of object shapes, weights and frictional properties, to provide optimal and secure handling in a variety of potentially perturbing environments. The dynamic interplay between sensory information and motor commands provides the basis for this flexibility, and recent studies supply somewhat unexpected evidence of the essential role played by cutaneous feedback in maintaining and acquiring predictive grip force control. These examples also offer new insights into the adaptive control of other voluntary movements.},

abstract = {We consider the motions and associated flow patterns of a swimming giant danio (Danio malabaricus). Experimental flow-visualization techniques have been employed to obtain the unsteady two-dimensional velocity fields around the straight-line swimming motions and a 60 °turn of the fish in the centerline plane of the fish depth. A three-dimensional numerical method is also employed to predict the total velocity field through simulation. Comparison of the experimental and numerical velocity and vorticity fields shows good agreement. The fish morphology, with its narrow peduncle region, allows for smooth flow into the articulated tail, which is able to sustain a large load for thrust generation. Streamlines of the flow detail complex processes that enhance the efficiency of flow actuation by the tail. The fish benefits from smooth nearbody flow patterns and the generation of controlled body-bound vorticity, which is propagated towards the tail, shed prior to the peduncle region and then manipulated by the caudal fin to form large-scale vortical structures with minimum wasted energy. This manipulation of body-generated vorticity and its interaction with the vorticity generated by the oscillating caudal fin are fundamental to the propulsion and maneuvering capabilities of fish.},

abstract = {As the characteristic size of a flying robot decreases, the challenges for successful flight revert to basic questions of fabrication, actuation, fluid mechanics, stabilization, and power, whereas such questions have in general been answered for larger aircraft. When developing a flying robot on the scale of a common housefly, all hardware must be developed from scratch as there is nothing off-the-shelf' which can be used for mechanisms, sensors, or computation that would satisfy the extreme mass and power limitations. This technology void also applies to techniques available for fabrication and assembly of the aeromechanical components: the scale and complexity of the mechanical features requires new ways to design and prototype at scales between macro and microeletromechanical systems, but with rich topologies and material choices one would expect when designing human-scale vehicles. With these challenges in mind, we present progress in the essential technologies for insect-scale robots, or pico' air vehicles.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design, development, and verification of a miniature integrated jumping and gliding robot, the MultiMo-Bat, which is inspired by the locomotion strategy of vampire bats. This 115.6 g robot exhibits high jumping and gliding performance, reaching heights of over 3 m, to overcome obstacles in the environment. The MultiMo-Bat was developed by a novel integrated design strategy that combines jumping and gliding locomotion modes and minimizes the necessary actuation and structural components by sharing a significant portion of the components required for each mode; nearly 70% of the total robot mass is utilized by both modes. This results in overall low mass, low volume, and high co-operation between the modes which allows for the preservation of over 80% of the performance of the independent jumping locomotion mode when combined. This not only allows for two high-performance locomotion modes, but also for all of the necessary actuation components to be on board. Key considerations and components of the design are discussed in the context of the integrated design approach. A prototype of the system is constructed and experimentally tested in various configurations to elucidate the overall system and integration performance. Finally, metrics are developed to begin to quantify the level and performance of the integrated approach as well as allow it to be compared to other mechanical and biological systems. This type of jumping and gliding robot can be used to explore, inspect, and monitor unstructured environments for security and environment monitoring applications. },

Tension in the margin compresses the radial veins, causing them to undergo Euler buckling. The model describes the distribution of compression forces in the veins around the spiral, and predicts conditions which must be met, and departures from the model expected in real wings. Actual insects fit the model and predictions quite well. The functional implications, and those of departure from the model, are discussed.},

abstract = {? 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.In this paper, we further explore multimodal locomotion via an updated robotic fish model based on Esox lucius. Besides the improved actuation properties like higher torque servomotors and powerful electronics, the robotic fish has some innovative mechanical design to pursue diverse swimming modes and superior performance. Specifically, we introduced a ?50? yawing head joint that functions as the neck for enhancing turning ability. A pair of pectoral mechanisms with two DOFs per fin is constructed to achieve 3-D swimming and to enrich multiple pectoral motions. At the control level, an improved central pattern generator (CPG) model allowing for free adjustment of the phase relationship among outputs is employed to produce rhythmic signals of multimodal swimming. Extensive experiments were carried out to examine how characteristic parameters in CPGs including amplitude, frequency, and phase lag affect the swimming performance. As a result, the robotic fish successfully performed various locomotion actions such as forward swimming, backward swimming, turning, diving, surfacing, as well as three pectoral motions in the form of pitching, heaving, and heaving-pitching. We found that small phase lag between oscillating joints which means large propulsive body wave length and undulation width could lead to a faster swimming in body and/or caudal fin (BCF) locomotion.},

abstract = {Cephalopods (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) play an important role as keystone invertebrates in various marine ecosystems, as well as being a valuable fisheries resource. At the World Malacological Congress, held 21–28 July 2013 in Ponta Delgada, Azores, Portugal, a number of cephalopod experts convened to honour the contribution of the late Malcolm R. Clarke, FRS (1930–2013) to cephalopod research. Endorsed by the Cephalopod International Advisory Council (CIAC), the meeting discussed some of the major challenges that cephalopod research will face in the future. These challenges were identified as follows: (1) to find new ways to ascertain the trophic role and food web links of cephalopods using hard tissues, stable isotopes and novel concepts in theoretical ecology; (2) to explore new approaches to the study of cephalopod morphology; (3) to further develop cephalopod aquaculture research; (4) to find new ways to ascertain cephalopod adaptation and response to environmental change; (5) to strengthen cephalopod genetics research; and (6) to develop new approaches for cephalopod fisheries and conservation. The present paper presents brief reviews on these topics, followed by a discussion of the general challenges that cephalopod research is bound to face in the near future. By contributing to initiatives both within CIAC and independent of CIAC, the principle aim of the paper is to stimulate future cephalopod research.},

abstract = {Bipedal locomotion skills are challenging to develop. Control strategies often use local linearization of the dynamics in conjunction with reduced-order abstractions to yield tractable solutions. In these model-based control strategies, the controller is often not fully aware of many details, including torque limits, joint limits, and other non-linearities that are necessarily excluded from the control computations for simplicity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for controlling bipedal locomotion which can more fully exploit the dynamics. However, current results in the machine learning literature are often based on ad-hoc simulation models that are not based on corresponding hardware. Thus it remains unclear how well DRL will succeed on realizable bipedal robots. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL using a realistic model of Cassie, a bipedal robot. By formulating a feedback control problem as finding the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process, we are able to learn robust walking controllers that imitate a reference motion with DRL. Controllers for different walking speeds are learned by imitating simple time-scaled versions of the original reference motion. Controller robustness is demonstrated through several challenging tests, including sensory delay, walking blindly on irregular terrain and unexpected pushes at the pelvis. We also show we can interpolate between individual policies and that robustness can be improved with an interpolated policy.},

abstract = {A 3D burr puzzle is a 3D model that consists of interlocking pieces with a single-key property. That is, when the puzzle is assembled, all the pieces are notched except one single key component which remains mobile. The intriguing property of the assembled burr puzzle is that it is stable, perfectly interlocked, without glue or screws, etc. Moreover, a burr puzzle consisting of a small number of pieces is still rather difficult to solve since the assembly must follow certain orders while the combinatorial complexity of the puzzle's piece arrangements is extremely high. In this paper, we generalize the 6-piece orthogonal burr puzzle (a knot) to design and model burr puzzles from 3D models. Given a 3D input model, we first interactively embed a network of knots into the 3D shape. Our method automatically optimizes and arranges the orientation of each knot, and modifies pieces of adjacent knots with an appropriate connection type. Then, following the geometry of the embedded pieces, the entire 3D model is partitioned by splitting the solid while respecting the assembly motion of embedded pieces. The main technical challenge is to enforce the single-key property and ensure the assembly/disassembly remains feasible, as the puzzle pieces in a network of knots are highly interlocked. Lastly, we also present an automated approach to generate the visualizations of the puzzle assembly process.},

The method consists of (1) slicing the NURBS surfaces or solids by finding the intersection of plane/surface; (2) forming the sliced curves; (3) setting up the local moving coordinate system; (4) determining the characteristic (also called singular) points or curves by obtaining local maxima points at discrete frames during motion and with respect to a local moving coordinate system; (5) fitting each NURBS singular surface; (6) trimming the singular surfaces to obtain the boundary of the final approximate swept volumes by the surface/surface intersection and perturbation method. The local moving coordinate system is set up in reference to the motion direction of the rigid body as determined from its composite velocity vector. This work aims to develop a rigorous method for identifying and visualizing the approximate swept volume generated as a result of sweeping a NURBS surface or solid. The method and numerical algorithm are illustrated through examples. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this study, concept generation is examined via brainstorming, morphology charts and sketching. Statistically significant correlations were found between the quantity of brainstormed ideas and design outcome. In some, but not all, experiments, correlations were found between the quantity of morphological alternatives and design outcome. This discrepancy between study results hints at the role of project length and difficulty in design. The volume of dimensioned drawings generated during the early-to-middle phases of design were found to correlate with design outcome, suggesting the importance of concrete sketching, timing and milestones in the design process.},

Springs can be attached across the knee joints in parallel with the knee actuators. The hybrid zero dy-namics framework serves as the basis for control of ERNIE's walking.

abstract = {Fish, reptiles, and mammals can possess flexible dermal armor for protection. Here we seek to find the means by which Nature derives its protection by examining the scales from several fish (Atractosteus spatula, Arapaima gigas, Polypterus senegalus, Morone saxatilis, Cyprinius carpio), and osteoderms from armadillos, alligators, and leatherback turtles. Dermal armor has clearly been developed by convergent evolution in these different species. In general, it has a hierarchical structure with collagen fibers joining more rigid units (scales or osteoderms), thereby increasing flexibility without significantly sacrificing strength, in contrast to rigid monolithic mineral composites. These dermal structures are also multifunctional, with hydrodynamic drag (in fish), coloration for camouflage or intraspecies recognition, temperature and fluid regulation being other important functions. The understanding of such flexible dermal armor is important as it may provide a basis for new synthetic, yet bioinspired, armor materials.},

abstract = {Hybrid ionically–covalently crosslinked double‐network {(DN)} hydrogels are attracting increasing attention on account of their self‐recovery ability and fatigue resistance, but their relative low mechanical strength and tedious performance adjustment severely limit their applications. Herein, a new strategy to concurrently fabricate hybrid ionic–covalent {DN} hydrogels and modulate their structures and mechanics is reported, in which an in situ formed chitosan ionic network is incorporated by post‐crosslinking the chitosan‐based composite hydrogel using multivalent anions solutions. The obtained hybrid {DN} hydrogels exhibit predominant mechanical properties including superior elastic modulus, high tensile strength, and ultrahigh fracture energy because of the more efficient energy dissipation of rigid short‐chain chitosan network. Notably, the swollen hydrogels still remain mechanically strong and tough even after immersion in water for 24 h. More significantly, simply changing the post‐crosslinking time can vary the compactness and rigidity of the chitosan network in situ, achieving flexible and efficient modulation of the structures and mechanics of the hybrid {DN} hydrogels. This study opens up a new horizon in the preparation and regulation of {DN} hydrogels for promising applications in tissue scaffolds, actuators, and wearable devices. Hybrid double‐network hydrogels are fabricated by a simple strategy and their structures and mechanics are modulated by incorporating an in situ formed chitosan ionic network via post‐crosslinking chitosan‐based composite hydrogels using multivalent anions solutions.

abstract = {Novel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-clay (PNIPAM-clay) nanocomposite (NC) hydrogels with both excellent responsive bending and elastic properties are developed as temperature-controlled manipulators. The PNIPAM-clay NC structure provides the hydrogel with excellent mechanical property, and the thermoresponsive bending property of the PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogel is achieved by designing an asymmetrical distribution of nanoclays across the hydrogel thickness. The hydrogel is simply fabricated by a two-step photo polymerization. The thermoresponsive bending property of the PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogel is resulted from the unequal forces generated by the thermoinduced asynchronous shrinkage of hydrogel layers with different clay contents. The thermoresponsive bending direction and degree of the PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogel can be adjusted by controlling the thickness ratio of the hydrogel layers with different clay contents. The prepared PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogels exhibit rapid, reversible, and repeatable thermoresponsive bending/unbending characteristics upon heating and cooling. The proposed PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogels with excellent responsive bending property are demonstrated as temperature-controlled manipulators for various applications including encapsulation, capture, and transportation of targeted objects. They are highly attractive material candidates for stimuli-responsive smart soft robots in myriad fields such as manipulators, grippers, and cantilever sensors.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the design of a soft wearable exoskeleton that comprises of a glove embedded with pneumatic actuators of variable stiffness for hand assistive and rehabilitation application. The device is lightweight and easily wearable due to the usage of soft pneumatic actuators. A key feature of the device is the variable stiffness of the actuators at different localities that not only conform to the finger profile during actuation, but also provides customizability for different hand dimensions. The actuators can achieve different bending profiles with variable stiffness implemented at different localities. Therefore, the device is able to perform different hand therapy exercises such as full fist, straight fist, hook fist and table top. The device was characterized in terms of its range of motion and maximum force output. Experiments were conducted to examine the differences between active and passive actuation. The results showed that the device could achieve hand grasping and pinching with acceptable range of motion and force.},

abstract = {We propose a whole finger manipulation (WFM) to improve the robustness of manipulation by a multifingered robot hand. The WFM is characterized by enveloping an object by finger links of the multifingered robot hand, and utilizing the frictionless sliding contacts between the surfaces of finger links and the grasped object. Therefore, the WFM can achieve a large manipulation without regrasping the object and can be highly robust in nature because of form-closure due to multiple contact points on the grasped object. This paper discusses the property and control of the WFM. The WFM with frictionless contact is shown to be a manipulable and force closure grasp using kinematics and statics with frictionless sliding contact. We discuss that the force closure for the WFM with frictionless contact can be viewed as form closure. An internal force-based impedance control is proposed for the stable manipulation in consideration of sliding contacts between the object and the finger links. A prototype hand and sensing systems are presented. The validity of the proposed control law is verified through the experiments.},

abstract = {This work develops a method for controlling a robotic fish, as it swims in a school, by following periodic stimuli generated by a neighboring robot. To track the motion of a periodically oscillating neighboring source, the hydrodynamic pressure around the body of the robotic fish is measured by a PVDF sensor attached to the robot. The pressure induced by the source is obtained by subtracting the predicted pressure generated by the robotic fish from the measured pressure. The controlled fish tail mechanism is represented as an oscillator, and a moving oscillating sphere is considered to be an external source. A dipole model based on the potential flow theory is used to predict the hydrodynamic pressure close to the fish tail. The relative phase between the tail and the oscillating source is estimated from the pressure measurements of the PVDF sensor. The difference in phase angle between the tail and the oscillating source is used to determine the torque used to drive the tail mechanism. The proposed method is demonstrated by the tank experiments that involve a captured model of a robotic fish that swims close to an oscillating source.},

abstract = {IEEE This paper presents a method to control a robotic fish to swim along a straight wall by measuring nearby hydrodynamic pressure variations. This robotic fish is built for exhibiting in a museum, and is expected to swim back and forth along the boundary of an aquarium. Transparent glass walls of the aquarium are not easy to detect for the robotic fish using the optical camera. In nature, fish can detect pressure variations around their bodies to extract near-field information. This concept is adopted for a fish-like swimming mechanism. In this study, the tail of the robot is modeled as an oscillating dipole in a 2-D potential flow, and the wall effect is described by an image dipole on the opposite side of the wall. Based on this model, the distance and angle of the robot with respect to the wall are derived from the magnitudes and ratios of pressure variations measured by pressure sensors distributed on the head and the body of the robot. The pressure information is then fed back to control the orientation of the robot. Experimental results show that the robotic fish is able to swim with a distance-to-wall & #x002F;tail-span ratio of 1-1.33 beside a wall. The wall effect decreases as the ratio increases. The proposed technique can be used to navigate a robotic fish with a close distance along a wall.},

abstract = {In this research, the capability of utilizing fluidic flexible matrix composites (F2MC) for autonomous structural tailoring is investigated. By taking advantage of the high anisotropy of flexible matrix composite (FMC) tubes and the high bulk modulus of the pressurizing fluid, significant changes in the effective modulus of elasticity can be achieved by controlling the inlet valve to the fluid-filled F2MC structure. The variable modulus F2MC structure has the flexibility to easily deform when desired (open-valve), possesses the high modulus required during loading conditions when deformation is not desired (closed-valve ĝ€" locked state), and has the adaptability to vary the modulus between the flexible/stiff states through control of the valve. In the current study, a 3D analytical model is developed to characterize the axial stiffness behavior of a single F2MC tube. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed model, and the test results show good agreement with the model predictions. A closed/open modulus ratio as high as 56 times is achieved experimentally. With the validated model, an F2MC design space study is performed. It is found that by tailoring the properties of the FMC tube and inner liner, a wide range of moduli and modulus ratios can be attained. By embedding multiple F 2MC tubes side by side in a soft matrix, a multi-cellular F 2MC sheet with a variable stiffness in one direction is constructed. The stiffness ratio of the multi-cellular F2MC sheet obtained experimentally shows good agreement with a model developed for this type of structure. A case study has been conducted to investigate the behavior of laminated [+60/0/-60]s multi-cellular F2MC sheets. It is shown that the laminate can achieve tunable, steerable, anisotropy by selective valve control. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2009.},

The problem to be solved then becomes a continuous nonlinear and multivariate optimization problem with many local optima. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain the global optimum. In this paper, we propose a method for solving this problem by using a real-coded genetic algorithm. Our method can treat not only data with a smooth underlying function, but also data with an underlying function having discontinuous points and/or cusps. We search for the best model among candidate models by using the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC). With this, we can appropriately determine the number and locations of knots automatically and simultaneously.

We validated the simulation against smoke visualizations and digital particle image velocimetry on real locusts. We then used the validated model to explore the effects of wing topography and deformation, first by removing camber while keeping the same time-varying twist distribution, and second by removing camber and spanwise twist. The full-fidelity model achieved greater power economy than the uncambered model, which performed better than the untwisted model, showing that the details of insect wing topography and deformation are important aerodynamically. Such details are likely to be important in engineering applications of flapping flight.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the design of a robotic fish and its motion control algorithms. A radio-controlled, four-link biomimetic robotic fish is developed using a flexible posterior body and an oscillating foil as a propeller. The swimming speed of the robotic fish is adjusted by modulating joint's oscillating frequency, and its orientation is tuned by different joint's deflections. Since the motion control of a robotic fish involves both hydrodynamics of the fluid environment and dynamics of the robot, it is very difficult to establish a precise mathematical model employing purely analytical methods. Therefore, the fish's motion control task is decomposed into two control systems. The online speed control implements a hybrid control strategy and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm. The orientation control system is based on a fuzzy logic controller. In our experiments, a point-to-point (PTP) control algorithm is implemented and an overhead vision system is adopted to provide real-time visual feedback. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

In centralized learning, every robot runs the same controller and the performance is evaluated with a global metric. In the distributed learning, robots run different controllers and the performance is evaluated independently on each robot with a local metric. Our results from learning in simulation show that it is possible to learn a cooperative task in a fully distributed way employing a local metric, and we validate the simulations with real robot experiments where the best solutions from distributed and centralized learning achieve similar performances.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}1996-2012 IEEE. This paper deals with a novel fast swimming robotic fish capable of high maneuverability and yet with less joints. On the basis of prior work on a single-motor-actuated miniature robotic fish, we mainly stress three aspects: mechanical design, motion analysis, and posture control to strike a tradeoff between speediness and maneuverability. Specifically, an improved mechanical structure endows the robot with large thrust and increased range of movements. Motion analysis offers useful guidance to parameter settings of steady swimming. Besides, sine-based functions responsible for generating traveling waves in conjunction with an analysis of parameter variation of oscillation amplitude of the fish tail serve the purpose to determine the posture of the robotic fish. Underwater tests on straight swimming and different turns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and mechatronic designs. Remarkably, the robot attained a maximum swimming speed of 1.14 m/s (corresponding to 3.07 body lengths per second) in forward swimming, a turning rate of approximately 90 °/s in normal turns, and a turning rate of approximately 63.8 °/s in hybrid turns.},

The material of the shell is assumed to be general cylindrically anisotropic. Based on the theory of cylindrical anisotropic elasticity, coupled governing partial differential equations are developed. The general expressions for the stresses and displacements in the laminated composite cylinders are discussed. The closed form solutions based on Classical Shell Theory (CST) and Donnell's (1933) theory are also derived for comparison purposes. Three examples illustrate the effect of radius-to-thickness ratio, coupling and stacking sequence. The results show that, in general, CST yields poor stress and displacement distributions for thick-section composite shells, but converges to the exact elasticity solution as the radius-to-thickness ratio increases. It is also shown that Donnell's theory significantly underestimates the stress and displacement response.},

This transformation is complex, not only because the properties of muscles are complex, but because the tendon affects the transmission of muscle force to the skeleton. This review focuses on how to synthesize basic properties of muscle and tendon to construct models applicable to studies of coordination. After a review of the properties of muscle and tendon, their integrated ability to generate force statically and dynamically is studied by formulating a generic model of the "musculotendon actuator", which has only one parameter, the ratio of tendon length at rest to muscle fiber length at rest. To illustrate the utility of the model, it is analyzed to show how this one parameter specifies whether excitation-contraction or musculotendon contraction is the rate-limiting process of force generation, whether elastic energy is stored in tendon or muscle, and whether hip- and knee-extensor actuators function as springs or dashpots during walking.},

After controlling for body size and phylogeny, multivariate comparisons indicate that several aspects of claw and toe morphology are correlated with clinging performance. Specifically, evolutionary increases in claw curvature, toe width and adhesive lamella number are correlated with increases in clinging performance on smooth substrates. Furthermore, evolutionary increases in claw height and decreases in toe length are correlated with increases in clinging performance on rough substrates. Sensitivity analyses revealed that changes in both branch lengths and procedural order of correction for body size and phylogeny do not generally have an effect on phylogenetic comparisons. These results demonstrate that the evolution of claw and toe morphology is correlated with the evolution of clinging performance across a wide range lizard taxa.},

The robots are modeled as a rigid body with six massless legs, each having two compliant degrees of freedom and the contact is modeled using Coulomb's model. We start our analysis by formulating the cost of transport for rigid legged robots as a function of their geometry, friction coefficients, actuation velocities and slope angle and compare it to the results of a dynamic multibody numeric simulation. In the second part, we estimate the cost of transport in the more general case when the legs and surface are compliant. We evaluate the energy consumptions factors, sliding, work against gravity, elastic losses of the legs and the surface, and kinetic energy and compare them to the total energy input of the actuators. This analysis allows us to evaluate the work range of the robots and determine the optimum locomotion paths for improved battery performance.},

The direction of turning depends on the configuration of the legs -tripod left of right- and the direction of the acceleration. Alternating acceleration in successive steps allows for continuous rotation in the desired direction. An analysis of the locomotion is presented as a function of the mechanical properties of the robot and the contact with the surface.

Minimally-actuated palm-size robots are capable of running at speeds greater than 2 meters per second (20 body lengths per second), with leg stride rates of greater than 20 Hz. In this dynamic regime, passive stabilization is needed for roll-and-pitch instability. However, we have found that certain roll-oscillation modes can be used for continuous high speed turning. Other continuous turning modes have also been identified, such as modulating foot contact location through foot compliance, and controlling differential leg velocity. For the small minimallyactuated robots examined, the dynamically enhanced roll-steer mode showed the best turning rate, of over 8 degrees per step, but only appears at certain running frequencies. Interstride phase and velocity control appears promising as a mode for in-plane maneuverability for under-actuated robots.},

STAR is fitted with spoke wheel-like legs which provide high electromechanical conversion efficiency and enable the robot to achieve legged performance over rough surfaces and obstacles, using a high sprawl angle, and nearly wheel-like performance over smooth surfaces for small sprawl angles.

Deployable metamaterials are usually flexible, particularly along their deploying and collapsing directions, which unfortunately in many cases leads to an unstable deployed state, i.e., small perturbations may collapse the structure along the same deployment path. Here we create an origami-inspired mechanical metamaterial with on-demand deployability and selective collapsibility through energy analysis. This metamaterial has autonomous deployability from the collapsed state and can be selectively collapsed along two different paths, embodying low stiffness for one path and substantially high stiffness for another path. The created mechanical metamaterial yields load-bearing capability in the deployed direction while possessing great deployability and collapsibility. The principle in this work can be utilized to design and create versatile origami-inspired mechanical metamaterials that can find many applications.},

abstract = {Robotic origami allows rapid prototyping of intelligent robots and machines constructed from thin sheets of functional materials. Multimaterial-based design freedom of origami robots creates functional versatility; however, the design parameters pose challenges in their mechanical layout and fabrication. While the conventional robot design follows a coherent and well-established design process, the construction of origami robots requires close study of their three-dimensional (3-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) geometries, compliant mechanisms, functional material specific components, and 2-D fabrication methods. In this paper, we report a systematic design methodology for building origami-inspired machines and robots based on these four essential design features. We provide their comprehensive formulation, comparing them to conventional robots and highlighting design challenges as well as potentials. We demonstrate the applicability of our procedure to the majority of origami robots in the literature and also validate it by designing a centimeter-scale jumping and crawling origami robot, Tribot, as a showcase. The 6-g Tribot crawls with fixed steps in a closed loop, adjusts its vertical jumping height by power modulation, and overcomes obstacles of 45-mm height by side jumps. This paper advances the design and fabrication methodology of origami robots, with customizable functionality from the ground-up.},

We then address the critical issue of how to model the state of contact in terms that are both sufficient for defining general contacts and conducive to bridging the gap between a robot task description and the information observable by a tactile sensor. We subsequently examine techniques for deriving tactile sensor models that are required for computing the state of contact from the sensor output. Two basic methods for mapping a tactile sensor image to the contact state variables are introduced: one based on explicit inverse modeling, and the other on numerical tactile Jacobian. In both cases, moments of the tactile sensor image are used as the features that capture the necessary information about contact. The theoretical development is supported by extensive experiments, which include edge tracking, object shape construction and object manipulation},

In this paper, we introduce a modular and reconfigurable mold for flexible design of pneumatic soft robotic grippers. By using simple assembly kits, students at all levels are able to design and construct soft robotic grippers that vary in function and performance. The process of constructing the modular mold enables students to understand how design choices impact system performance. Our unique modular mold allows students to select the number and length of fingers in a gripper, as well as to adjust the internal geometry of the pneumatic actuator cavity, which dictates how and where bending of a finger occurs. In addition, the mold may be deconstructed and reconfigured, which allows for fast iterative design and lowers material costs (since a new mold does not need to be made to implement a design change). We further demonstrate the feasibility of the modular mold by implementing it in a soft robot design activity in classrooms and showing a sufficiently high rate of student success in designing and constructing a functional soft robotic gripper.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design of a jumping robot inspired by jumping locomotion of locusts. The mechanisms of jumping, self-righting, steering, and takeoff angle adjusting are modeled and simulated firstly. Then the 3D model of the robot is designed and a prototype of the robot is fabricated. An eccentric cam with quick return characteristics is used by the jumping mechanism to compress torsion springs for energy storing and to trigger the springs for a quick release of energy. The self-righting, steering, and takeoff angle adjusting capabilities of the robot are achieved by adding a rotatable pole leg. The pole leg can prop up the body of the robot when it falls down. The pole leg can also steer the robot to turn step by step. By adjusting its center of mass (COM) using the pole leg with an additional weight, the robot can jump at different takeoff angles. A 9cm×7cm×12cm, 154g jumping robot prototype is implemented. The fundamental characteristics of the robot are tested. Experimental results show that the constructed robot can jump more than 88cm high at a takeoff angle of 80.33°. The robot rotates about 277° in the air during jumping. The robot can self-right when it falls down to its left, right, and front sides in 9s, 9s, and 26s respectively. The robot can steer 360° in 42s with 14 steps, about 25.7° per step. Its takeoff angle ranges between 80.33° and 86.92°. The robot can continuously jump to overcome stairs and jump forward in outdoor environments with self-righting and steering. The experimental results are compared with the simulation results. The differences between them are explained.},

abstract = {Flying insects and swimming fishes have high efficiency and high maneuverability in air and water, respectively. Their wings and fins have evolved for many ages to adapt to propelling in the complex environment. In this paper, an integrative biomimetic robotic fish is proposed and developed, which combines the advantages of insect wings and fish fins to achieve a high agility underwater. In the robotic fish, two caudal fins were equipped at the tail of the robotic fish in parallel as the main propulsion mechanism, the opposite flapping of the two caudal fins generates mutually opposing lateral forces during cruising, which leads to a stable and high-performance swimming. In addition, two pectoral fins that mimic the function of insect wings were equipped at two sides of the robotic fish, which enhances the robotic fish maneuverability in vertical plane. Moreover, a central pattern generator model was designed to achieve the versatile maneuvering motions, motion switching, and autonomous swimming with an obstacle avoiding ability. The experiments have demonstrated that the robotic fish can swim more stably and efficiently with versatile maneuver motions by taking advantage of the integrative propulsion mechanism. The developed robotic fish have many potential applications for its agility, stable swimming, and low-cost structure.},

The method is based on the tau theory which was established from studying the natural motion behaviors when animals (including humans) approaching and catching a fixed or moving object. In our research, the tau theory is applied to the trajectory generation problem of a UAV perching on a target object. Two perching scenarios have been studied, one from a flight state (with non-zero initial velocity) and one from a hovering state (with zero initial velocity). Three strategies, namely, perching with a straight-line trajectory, perching with pitch angle coupling, and perching with pitch/yaw angular coupling, are demonstrated with each of the two scenarios. The simulation results show that the resulting flight trajectories meet all the desired requirements for a rotary UAV to perch on an object.},

The robot can achieve the following three performances simultaneously, which distinguish it from the other existing jumping robots. First, it can perform continuous steerable jumping that is based on the self-righting and the steering capabilities. Second, the robot only requires a single actuator to perform all the functions. Third, the robot has a light weight (23.5 g) to reduce the damage that results from the impact of landing. Experimental results show that, with a 75° take-off angle, the robot can jump up to 87 cm in vertical height and 90 cm in horizontal distance.

abstract = {Recent work on the aerodynamics of flapping flight reveals fundamental differences in the mechanisms of aerodynamic force generation between fixed and flapping wings. When fixed wings translate at high angles of attack, they periodically generate and shed leading and trailing edge vortices as reflected in their fluctuating aerodynamic force traces and associated flow visualization. In contrast, wings flapping at high angles of attack generate stable leading edge vorticity, which persists throughout the duration of the stroke and enhances mean aerodynamic forces. Here, we show that aerodynamic forces can be controlled by altering the trailing edge flexibility of a flapping wing. We used a dynamically scaled mechanical model of flapping flight (Re ≈ 2000) to measure the aerodynamic forces on flapping wings of variable flexural stiffness (EI). For low to medium angles of attack, as flexibility of the wing increases, its ability to generate aerodynamic forces decreases monotonically but its lift-todrag ratios remain approximately constant. The instantaneous force traces reveal no major differences in the underlying modes of force generation for flexible and rigid wings, but the magnitude of force, the angle of net force vector and centre of pressure all vary systematically with wing flexibility. Even a rudimentary framework of wing veins is sufficient to restore the ability of flexible wings to generate forces at near-rigid values. Thus, the magnitude of force generation can be controlled by modulating the trailing edge flexibility and thereby controlling the magnitude of the leading edge vorticity. To characterize this, we have generated a detailed database of aerodynamic forces as a function of several variables including material properties, kinematics, aerodynamic forces and centre of pressure, which can also be used to help validate computational models of aeroelastic flapping wings.

abstract = {Instruments used in endoscopic surgery (colonoscopy surgery or natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES)) are flexible to be advanced in human body. However, when the end of the instrument reaches the target, the instrument should be rigid enough to hold its shape against external forces for better surgical accuracy. In order to obtain these two properties, a variable stiffness over tube based on low-melting-pointalloy (LMPA) is proposed in this paper. The structure exploits the phase transformation property of the LMPA which enables the stiffness change of the over tube by heating and cooling. A prototype was fabricated using a special molding method, and experiments were carried out to evaluate its variable stiffness property and response characteristics. According to experimental results, it costs 17 s to make the over tube transform from rigid state to flexible state and 18 s to make the over tube transform from flexible state to rigid state. The experimental results also indicated that the over tube is very rigid in rigid state and flexible in compliant state. A heat insulation layer was assembled to prevent human tissue from thermal damage. The temperature of the outer wall of the over tube was 42.5 °C when hot water of 80 °C was pumped into the over tube continually with the help of the heat insulation layer.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}1996-2012 IEEE. In the past two decades, a large number of robot fishes have been built, though their performances are still far inferior compared with that of the real fish. One of the key reasons is the design. This paper presents a novel robot fish. The key innovation is the combination of an active wire-driven body with a soft compliant tail to accomplish undulatory swimming (i.e., flapping in 'S' motion). First, the design is presented. Second, the design and analysis model is given. In particular, it is shown that the compliant tail can be modeled through the proposed multipseudolink model. Then, a prototype and experimental results are presented. The experiment results demonstrate that the kinematics of the robot fish can be predicted by the presented model with reasonable errors. Moreover, it has several advantages; simple in structure, easy to control, capable of high-speed swimming (the maximum speed is 2.15 body lengths/s), and good maneuverability (the average turning speed is 63°/s). Most importantly, it is highly efficient; the swimming performance of the robot fish is close to that of a real fish.},

abstract = {As a novel biologically inspired underwater vehicle, a robotic manta ray (RoMan-II) has been developed for potential marine applications. Manta ray can perform diversified locomotion patterns in water by manipulating two wide fins. These motion patterns have been implemented on the developed fish robot, including swimming by flapping fins, turning by modulating phase relations of fins, and online transition of different motion patterns. The movements are achieved by using a model of artificial central pattern generators (CPGs) constructed with coupled nonlinear oscillators. This paper focuses on the analytical formulation of coupling terms in the CPG model and the implementation issues of the CPG-based control on the fish robot. The control method demonstrated on the manta ray robot is expected to be a framework that can tackle locomotion control problems in other types of multifin-actuated fish robots or more general robots with rhythmic movement patterns. {\textcopyright}2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {An experiment-based approach is proposed to improve the performance of biomimetic undulatory locomotion through on-line optimization. The approach is implemented through two steps: (1) the generation of coordinated swimming gaits by artificial Central Pattern Generators (CPGs); (2) an on-line searching of optimal parameter sets for the CPG model using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in the optimization of swimming speed and energy efficiency for a biomimetic fin propulsor. To evaluate how well the input energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the propulsor, an energy-efficiency index is presented and utilized as a feedback to regulate the on-line searching with a closed-loop swimming control. Experiments were conducted on propulsor prototypes with different fin segments and the optimal swimming patterns were found separately. Comparisons of results show that the optimal curvature of undulatory propulsor, which might have different shapes depending on the actual prototype design and control scheme. It is also found that the propulsor with six fin segments, is preferable because of higher speed and lower energy efficiency. {\textcopyright}2014 Jilin University.},

abstract = {Tuna and related scombrid fishes are high-performance swimmers that often operate at high frequencies, especially during behaviors such as escaping from predators or catching prey. This contrasts with most fish-like robotic systems that typically operate at low frequencies (< 2 hertz). To explore the high-frequency fish swimming performance space, we designed and tested a new platform based on yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus). Body kinematics, speed, and power were measured at increasing tail beat frequencies to quantify swimming performance and to study flow fields generated by the tail. Experimental analyses of freely swimming tuna and mackerel allow comparison with the tuna-like robotic system. The Tunabot (255 millimeters long) can achieve a maximum tail beat frequency of 15 hertz, which corresponds to a swimming speed of 4.0 body lengths per second. Comparison of midline kinematics between scombrid fish and the Tunabot shows good agreement over a wide range of frequencies, with the biggest discrepancy occurring at the caudal fin, primarily due to the rigid propulsor used in the robotic model. As frequency increases, cost of transport (COT) follows a fish-like U-shaped response with a minimum at $\sim$1.6 body lengths per second. The Tunabot has a range of $\sim$9.1 kilometers if it swims at 0.4 meter per second or $\sim$4.2 kilometers at 1.0 meter per second, assuming a 10{\textendash}watt-hour battery pack. These results highlight the capabilities of high-frequency biological swimming and lay the foundation to explore a fish-like performance space for bio-inspired underwater vehicles.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. This paper presents a 3-dimensional (3D) printed soft parallel contactless actuator for the first time. The actuator involves an electro-responsive parallel mechanism made of two segments namely active chain and passive chain both 3D printed. The active chain is attached to the ground from one end and constitutes two actuator links made of responsive hydrogel. The passive chain, on the other hand, is attached to the active chain from one end and consists of two rigid links made of polymer. The actuator links are printed using an extrusion-based 3D-Bioplotter with polyelectrolyte hydrogel as printer ink. The rigid links are also printed by a 3D fused deposition modelling (FDM) printer with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as print material. The kinematics model of the soft parallel actuator is derived via transformation matrices notations to simulate and determine the workspace of the actuator. The printed soft parallel actuator is then immersed into NaOH solution with specific voltage applied to it via two contactless electrodes. The experimental data is then collected and used to develop a parametric model to estimate the end-effector position and regulate kinematics model in response to specific input voltage over time. It is observed that the electroactive actuator demonstrates expected behaviour according to the simulation of its kinematics model. The use of 3D printing for the fabrication of parallel soft actuators opens a new chapter in manufacturing sophisticated soft actuators with high dexterity and mechanical robustness for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and drug release.},

abstract = {The mole-rat (Spalax ehrenbergi) is a solitary, subterranean rodent that excavates and inhabits its own tunnel system. The present study employed continuous radio-telemetry in order to determine the structure and use of the mole-rat's territory throughout the year. The use of radiotagged animals revealed that the spatial division of individuals in one area cannot be predicted simply on the basis of the above-ground distribution of mounds. It was shown that mole-rat territories undergo constant change in use and location throughout the year, with tunnel lengths averaging 18.7 +- 4.0 m in the dry season and 39.1 +- 7.1 m in the rainy season. The basic pattern of the mole-rat tunnel system consisted of a main tunnel, 20-40 cm below the ground, with several short secondary tunnels branching off it. Most of the nests were connected to the tunnel system by two or more exits. During one 24-h period, a mole-rat travelled about 17 times the total length of its territory. Mole-rats are active for about 50% of the time all year round, mainly during the day, and always return to the same nest for resting periods. The mole-rat traverses its territory by walking short distances (c. 2 m) interspersed with pauses at certain permanent sites. While the pattern of territorial patrol normally remains uniform, under threat the patrol ceases to be homogeneous and the frequency of visits to confrontational areas increases. At these locations, the mole-rat produces its 'head drumming' (vibrational) communication in order to announce its presence and defend its territory.},
