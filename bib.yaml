  abstract: 'Machining operation planning involves the selection and sequencing of
    machining operations for fabricating a workpiece. It is the first step in the
    process of generating a detailed process plan for a workpiece. In the past five
    years, several knowledge-based systems have been developed. Two knowledge representation
    schemes are employed: production rules and frames. Each of these exhibits some
    general properties of human information processing but neglects the other. None
    of the existing systems is able to solve real-world problems. The main focus of
    this paper is on a layered architecture for manufacturing knowledge representation
    and automated reasoning for operation planning. This can be addressed through
    a discussion of both the knowledge representation structure and the inference
    mechanism. The proposed layered architecture has been implemented on a microcomputer
    using PROLOG. The results are satisfactory. ?? 1988.'

  issue: '7674'
  abstract: In the design of industrial products ranging from hearing aids to automobiles
    and aeroplanes, material is distributed so as to maximize the performance and
    minimize the cost. Historically, human intuition and insight have driven the evolution
    of mechanical design, recently assisted by computer-aided design approaches. The
    computer-aided approach known as topology optimization enables unrestricted design
    freedom and shows great promise with regard to weight savings, but its applicability
    has so far been limited to the design of single components or simple structures,
    owing to the resolution limits of current optimization methods1,2. Here we report
    a computational morphogenesis tool, implemented on a supercomputer, that produces
    designs with giga-voxel resolution- more than two orders of magnitude higher than
    previously reported. Such resolution provides insights into the optimal distribution
    of material within a structure that were hitherto unachievable owing to the challenges
    of scaling up existing modelling and optimization frameworks. As an example, we
    apply the tool to the design of the internal structure of a full-scale aeroplane
    wing. The optimized full-wing design has unprecedented structural detail at length
    scales ranging from tens of metres to millimetres and, intriguingly, shows remarkable
    similarity to naturally occurring bone structures in, for example, bird beaks.
    We estimate that our optimized design corresponds to a reduction in mass of 2-5
    per cent compared to currently used aeroplane wing designs, which translates into
    a reduction in fuel consumption of about 40-200 tonnes per year per aeroplane.
    Our morphogenesis process is generally applicable, not only to mechanical design,
    but also to flow systems3, antennas4, nano-optics5 and micro-systems.

  abstract: We prove that every simple polygon can be made as a (2D) pop-up card/book
    that opens to any desired angle between 0 and 360°. More precisely, given a simple
    polygon attached to the two walls of the open pop-up, our polynomial-time algorithm
    subdivides the polygon into a single-degree-of-freedom linkage structure, such
    that closing the pop-up flattens the linkage without collision. This result solves
    an open problem of Hara and Sugihara from 2009. We also show how to obtain a more
    efficient construction for the special case of orthogonal polygons, and how to
    make 3D orthogonal polyhedra, from pop-ups that open to 90°, 180°, 270°, or 360°.

  abstract: Virtual reality has achieved an adequate level of development for it to
    be considered in innovative applications such as education, training, and research
    in higher education. Virtual reality offers both opportunities and challenges
    for the educational sector. One of the challenges of virtual reality technology
    is the costs associated which have been unaffordable for educational institutes.
    However, in recent years, computer hardware and software development has made
    it more feasible to incorporate virtual reality technology into future teaching
    strategies. Despite the cost challenges, educational benefits of implementing
    virtual reality remain compelling. This paper explains virtual reality principle
    and describes the interactive educational environment developed at WMG, the University
    of Warwick. It also discusses the benefits of using state-of-the-art 3D photorealistic
    interactive and immersive virtual environment for engineering undergraduates and
    postgraduate teaching, learning and training.

  abstract: Educating effective engineering designers is an important goal. Exploring
    the extent to which this goal is being met hinges on our ability to characterise
    what contributes to effectiveness and to map students’ performance against such
    standards. In previous work, we used verbal protocol analysis to analyse differences
    in the design processes of freshmen and seniors, the effects of interventions
    on student design processes, and process factors that contribute to product quality.
    In this paper, we utilise Sch??n’s reflective practitioner theory to discuss our
    empirical results in the context of educating reflective practitioners. Such an
    approach may provide implications for enhancing engineering education. ?? 2003

  container-title: Origin and phylogenetic interrelationships of teleosts
  page: 337-362
  abstract: The catfishes (Siluriformes) comprise a particularly diverse teleost clade,
    from a taxonomic, morphological, biogeographical, ecological and behavioural perspective.
    The Neotropical Trichomycteridae (the “parasitic” catfi shes) are emblematic of
    this diversity, including fi shes with some of the most specialized habits and
    habitats among teleosts (e. g. hematophagy, lepidophagy, miniaturization, fossorial
    habitats, altitudinal extremes). Relatively little information is available on
    general trichomycterid morphology, as most work so far has concentrated on phylogenetically
    informative characters, with little concern about general descriptive anatomy.
    In this paper we provide a synthesis of new and previously-available data in order
    to build a general picture of basal crown group trichomycterid morphology and
    of its main modifi cations. We focus on the evolutionary morphology in two relatively
    distal trichomycterid lineages, i. e. the hematophagous Vandelliinae and the miniature,
    substrate dwelling Glanapteryginae. New evidence is discussed in relation to the
    evolution of the opercular system as well as morphological modifi cations in miniature
    species exhibiting an interstitial life style.

  container-title: 2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 2971-2976
  abstract: This paper presents the development of a lightweight origami-inspired
    foldable hexapod robot. Using a single sheet of polyester and a laser cutter,
    the hexapod robot can be fabricated and assembled in less than one hour from scratch.
    No screw or other external tools are required for assembly. The robot has built-in
    polyester fasteners considered in its crease pattern. The design uses four-bar
    mechanisms, which makes the robot flexible to be adjusted for different speeds
    or other task metrics. For a given desired locomotion velocity, various parameters
    of the four-bar mechanisms in the crease pattern can be modified accordingly.
    Design flexibility, ease of fabrication, and low cost make the robot suitable
    as an agent for swarm objectives. This work presents the foldable hexapod design
    and its kinematic analysis. The robot is fabricated, assembled, and tested for
    functionality. Experimental results show that the robot prototype runs with a
    maximum forward speed of 5 body lengths per second and turns in place with a speed
    of 1 revolution per second. The final robot weighs 42 grams.

  volume: '79'

  abstract: In this review we argue for the creation of a physics of moving systems
    – a locomotion "robophysics" – which we define as the pursuit of the discovery
    of principles of self generated motion. Robophysics can provide an important intellectual
    complement to the discipline of robotics, largely the domain of researchers from
    engineering and computer science. The essential idea is that we must complement
    study of complex robots in complex situations with systematic study of simplified
    robophysical devices in controlled laboratory settings and simplified theoretical
    models. We must thus use the methods of physics to examine successful and failed
    locomotion in simplified (abstracted) devices using parameter space exploration,
    systematic control, and techniques from dynamical systems. Using examples from
    our and other’s research, we will discuss how such robophysical studies have begun
    to aid engineers in the creation of devices that begin to achieve life-like locomotor
    abilities on and within complex environments, have inspired interesting physics
    questions in low dimensional dynamical systems, geometric mechanics and soft matter
    physics, and have been useful to develop models for biological locomotion in complex
    terrain. The rapidly decreasing cost of constructing sophisticated robot models
    with easy access to significant computational power bodes well for scientists
    and engineers to engage in a discipline which can readily integrate experiment,
    theory and computation.

  volume: '208'
  issue: Pt 9
  abstract: To achieve the required generality, models designed to predict scaling
    relationships for diverse groups of animals generally need to be simple. An argument
    based on considerations of dynamic similarity predicts correctly that the mechanical
    cost of transport for running \[power/(body mass x speed)\] will be independent
    of body mass; but measurements of oxygen consumption for running birds and mammals
    show that the metabolic cost of transport is proportional to (body mass)-0.32.
    Thus the leg muscles seem to work more efficiently in larger animals. A model
    that treats birds as fixed wing aircraft predicts that the mechanical power required
    for flight at the maximum range speed will be proportional to (body mass)1.02,
    but the metabolic power is found to be proportional to (body mass)0.83; again,
    larger animals seem to have more efficient muscles. A model that treats hovering
    hummingbirds and insects as helicopters predicts mechanical power to be approximately
    proportional to body mass, but measurements of oxygen consumption once again show
    efficiency increasing with body mass. A model of swimming fish as rigid submarines
    predicts power to be proportional to (body mass)0.5 x (speed)2.5 or to (body mass)0.6
    x (speed)2.8, depending on whether flow in the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent.
    Unfortunately, this prediction cannot easily be compared with available compilations
    of metabolic data. The finding that efficiency seems to increase with body mass,
    at least in running and flight, is discussed in relation to the metabolic energy
    costs of muscular work and force.

  container-title: Journal of Zoology
  page: 265-303
  volume: '177'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Force‐platform records and films of kangaroos and a wallaby hopping have
    been analysed to obtain data about the energetics of hopping and about the stresses
    which act in muscles, tendons and the tibia. The quantitative anatomical data
    required for the analysis have been obtained from X‐radiographs and dissections.
    It is shown that fluctuations of potential energy and external kinetic energy
    account for most of the energy cost of hopping; fluctuations of internal kinetic
    energy are relatively unimportant. Evidence is presented that large savings of
    energy are effected by elastic storage of energy in the gastrocnemius and plantaris
    tendons. The elastic mechanism is particularly effective at high speeds and seems
    to account for the observation of Dawson & Taylor (1973) that oxygen consumption
    is more or less constant over the whole range of hopping speeds. A mathematical
    model of hopping is presented. The stresses which occur in hopping are discussed.
    Force platform records and films have been made of kangaroos and a wallaby hopping.
    The maximum forces exerted on the ground were about six times body weight. The
    force exerted on the ground changes direction, throughout the period when the
    feet are on the ground, so that it is always more or less in line with the centre
    of mass. Consequently the animal decelerates a little and then accelerates again,
    during the contact phase. The fluctuations of potential energy which occur in
    each hop are slightly smaller at high speeds than at low ones. Fluctuations of
    external kinetic energy increase with speed and account for most of the energy
    cost of hopping at high speeds. Fluctuations of internal kinetic energy (due to
    acceleration and deceleration of the limbs) are relatively small. While the feet
    are on the ground the extensor muscles of the hip do positive work, those of the
    knee negative work and those of the ankle negative work followed by positive work.
    The energy cost of hopping is reduced substantially by elastic storage of energy
    in the Achilles tendon. In the case of a wallaby hopping at moderate speed the
    calculated saving was 40

  container-title: Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
  page: 495-503
  volume: '58'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Like many phenotypic traits, biomechanical systems are defined by both
    an underlying morphology and an emergent functional property. The relationship
    between these levels may have a profound impact on how selection for functional
    performance is translated into morphological evolution. In particular, complex
    mechanical systems are likely to be highly redundant, because many alternative
    morphologies yield equivalent functions. We suggest that this redundancy weakens
    the relationship between morphological and functional diversity, and we illustrate
    this effect using an evolutionary model of the four-bar lever system of labrid
    fishes. Our results demonstrate that, when traits are complex, the morphological
    diversity of a clade may only weakly predict its mechanical diversity. Furthermore,
    parallel or convergent selection on function does not necessarily produce convergence
    in morphology. Empirical observations suggest that this weak form-function relationship
    has contributed to the morphological diversity of labrid fishes, as functionally
    equivalent species may nevertheless possess morphologically distinct jaws. We
    suggest that partial decoupling of morphology and mechanics due to redundancy
    is a major factor in morphological diversification.

  container-title: Control and cybernetics
  page: 59-80
  volume: '34'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: A numerical coupling of two recent methods in shape and topology optimization
    of structures is proposed. On the one hand, the level set method, based on the
    classical shape derivative, is known to easily handle boundary propagation with
    topological changes. However, in practice it does not allow for the nucleation
    of new holes (at least in 2-d). On the other hand, the bubble or topological gradient
    method is precisely designed for introducing new holes in the optimization process.
    Therefore, the coupling of these two method yields an efficient algorithmwhich
    can escape from local minima in a given topological class of shapes. Both methods
    rely on the notion of gradient computed through an adjoint analysis, and have
    a low CPU cost since they capture a shape on a fixed Eulerian mesh. The main advantage
    of our coupled algorithm is to make the resulting optimal design largely independent
    of the initial guess.

  volume: 2015-Decem
  issue: November
  abstract: 2015 IEEE. The use of standard platforms in the field of humanoid robotics
    can accelerate research, and lower the entry barrier for new research groups.
    While many affordable humanoid standard platforms exist in the lower size ranges
    of up to 60 cm, beyond this the few available standard platforms quickly become
    significantly more expensive, and difficult to operate and maintain. In this paper,
    the igus Humanoid Open Platform is presented - a new, affordable, versatile and
    easily customisable standard platform for humanoid robots in the child-sized range.
    At 90 cm, the robot is large enough to interact with a human-scale environment
    in a meaningful way, and is equipped with enough torque and computing power to
    foster research in many possible directions. The structure of the robot is entirely
    3D printed, allowing for a lightweight and appealing design. The electrical and
    mechanical designs of the robot are presented, and the main features of the corresponding
    open-source ROS software are discussed. The 3D CAD files for all of the robot
    parts have been released open-source in conjunction with this paper.

  container-title: Autonomous Robots
  page: 207-213
  volume: '11'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: RHex is an untethered, compliant leg hexapod robot that travels at better
    than one body length per second over terrain few other robots can negotiate at
    all. Inspired by biomechanics insights into arthropod locomotion, RHex uses a
    clock excited alternating tripod gait to walk and run in a highly maneuverable
    and robust manner. We present empirical data establishing that RHex exhibits a
    dynamical (“bouncing”) gait—its mass center moves in a manner well approximated
    by trajectories from a Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP)—characteristic of
    a large and diverse group of running animals, when its central clock, body mass,
    and leg stiffnesses are appropriately tuned. The SLIP template can function as
    a useful control guide in developing more complex autonomous locomotion behaviors
    such as registration via visual servoing, local exploration via visual odometry,
    obstacle avoidance, and, eventually, global mapping and localization.

  volume: '271'
  abstract: This paper presents the first evidence that the Spring Loaded Inverted
    Pendulum (SLIP) may be anchored in our recently designed compliant leg hexapod
    robot, RHex. Experimentally measured RHex center of mass trajectories are fit
    to the SLIP model and an analysis of the fitting error is performed. The fitting
    results are corroborated by numerical simulations. The anchoring of SLIP dynamics
    in RHex offers exciting possibilities for hierarchical control of hexapod robots.

  abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end approach for creating 3D shapes by self-folding
    planar sheets activated by uniform heating. These shapes can be used as the mechanical
    bodies of robots. The input to this process is a 3D geometry (e.g. an OBJ file).
    The output is a physical object with the specified geometry. We describe an algorithm
    pipeline that (1) identifies the overall geometry of the input, (2) computes a
    crease pattern that causes the sheet to self-fold into the desired 3D geometry
    when activated by uniform heating, (3) automatically generates the design of a
    2D sheet with the desired pattern and (4) automatically generates the design files
    required to fabricate the 2D structure. We demonstrate these algorithms by applying
    them to complex 3D shapes. We demonstrate the fabrication of a self-folding object
    with over 50 faces from automatically generated design files.

  container-title: ACS Nano
  page: 1213-1218
  volume: '2'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: The DNA origami method allows the folding of long, single-stranded DNA
    sequences into arbitrary two-dimensional structures by a set of designed oligonucleotides.
    The method has revealed an unexpected strength and efficiency for programmed self-assembly
    of molecular nanostructures and makes it possible to produce fully addressable
    nanostructures with wide-reaching application potential within the emerging area
    of nanoscience. Here we present a user-friendly software package for designing
    DNA origami structures ( http://www.cdna.dk/origami ) and demonstrate its use
    by the design of a dolphin-like DNA origami structure that was imaged by high-resolution
    AFM in liquid. The software package provides automatic generation of DNA origami
    structures, manual editing, interactive overviews, atomic models, tracks the design
    history, and has a fully extendable toolbox. From the AFM images, it was demonstrated
    that different designs of the dolphin tail region provided various levels of flexibility
    in a predictable fashion. Finally, we show that the addition of specific attachment
    sites promotes dimerization between two independently self-assembled dolphin structures,
    and that these interactions stabilize the flexible tail.

  publisher: IEEE
  page: 517-522
  abstract: This paper presents the mechanical design of an ultra-lightweight, biomimetically
    actuated anthropomorphic hand for prosthetic purposes. The proposed design is
    based on an underactuated configuration of 16 joints and 7 active degrees of freedom.
    Shape Memory Alloy wires are used as motive elements of a specially designed actuation
    system installed within the envelope of the hand and forearm; due to their inherent
    contraction ability when heated, these innovative micro-actuators produce linear
    motion which is imparted to the fingers via a tendon transmission system. The
    overall design is completed with the integration of the necessary locking mechanisms
    for power saving. An experimental prototype of the suggested prosthesis has been
    fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques and it will be used as an evaluation
    platform for further research towards the development of a truly multifunctional,
    silent and cosmetically appealing hand for upper limb amputees.

  container-title: 'Robotics: Science and systems xiv'
  publisher: 'Robotics: Science; Systems Foundation'
  abstract: We apply fast online trajectory optimization for multi-step motion planning
    to Cassie, a bipedal robot designed to exploit natural spring-mass locomotion
    dynamics using lightweight, compliant legs. Our motion planning formulation simultaneously
    optimizes over center of mass motion, footholds, and center of pressure for a
    simplified model that combines trans-verse linear inverted pendulum and vertical
    spring dynamics. A vertex-based representation of the support area combined with
    this simplified dynamic model that allows closed form integration leads to a fast
    nonlinear programming problem formulation. This optimization problem is continuously
    solved online in a model predictive control approach. The output of the reduced-order
    planner is fed into a quadratic programming based operational space controller
    for execution on the full-order system. We present simulation results showing
    the performance and robustness to disturbances of the planning and control framework.
    Preliminary results on the physical robot show functionality of the operational
    space control system, with integration of the trajectory planner a work in progress.

  container-title: Additive Manufacturing
  publisher: Elsevier B.V.
  page: 1-13
  volume: '13'
  abstract: Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables the production of geometrically complex
    parts that are difficult to manufacture by other means. However, conventional
    CAD systems are limited in the representation of such parts. This issue is exacerbated
    when lattice structures are combined or embedded within a complex geometry. This
    paper presents a computationally efficient, voxel-based method of generating lattices
    comprised of practically any cell type that can conform to an arbitrary external
    geometry. The method of conforming involves the tessellation and trimming of unit
    cells that can leave ‘hanging’ struts at the surface, which is a possible point
    of weakness in the structure. A method of joining these struts to form an external
    two dimensional lattice, termed a ‘net-skin’ is also described. Traditional methods
    of manufacturing lattice structures generally do not allow variation of cell properties
    within a structure; however, additive manufacturing enables graded lattices to
    be generated that are potentially more optimal. A method of functionally grading
    lattices is, therefore, also described to take advantage of this manufacturing
    capability.

  page: 1699-1704
  abstract: 'This paper presents a variable damping control strategy to improve trade-off
    between agility/performance and stability in the control of the ankle exoskeleton
    robot. Depending on the user’s intent of movement, the proposed variable damping
    controller determines the robotic ankle damping from negative to positive damping
    values. The range of damping values is determined by incorporating the knowledge
    of human ankle damping in order to always secure stability of the ankle joint
    of the coupled human-robot system. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
    controller, we performed a set of human experiments with three different robotic
    damping conditions: fixed positive damping, fixed negative damping, and variable
    damping. Comparison of the two fixed damping conditions confirmed that there exists
    a clear trade-off between ankle agility and stability. Further, analysis of the
    variable damping condition demonstrated that humans could get benefits of not
    only positive damping to stabilize the ankle but also negative damping to enhance
    the agility of ankle movement as necessary during dynamic ankle movement. On average,
    the variable damping condition improved the agility of ankle movement by 76'

  volume: '39'
  abstract: Fabrication of three-dimensional structures has gained increasing importance
    in the bone tissue engineering (BTE) field. Mechanical properties and permeability
    are two important requirement for BTE scaffolds. The mechanical properties of
    the scaffolds are highly dependent on the processing parameters. Layer thickness,
    delay time between spreading each powder layer, and printing orientation are the
    major factors that determine the porosity and compression strength of the 3D printed
    scaffold. In this study, the aggregated artificial neural network (AANN) was used
    to investigate the simultaneous effects of layer thickness, delay time between
    spreading each layer, and print orientation of porous structures on the compressive
    strength and porosity of scaffolds. Two optimization methods were applied to obtain
    the optimal 3D parameter settings for printing tiny porous structures as a real
    BTE problem. First, particle swarm optimization algorithm was implemented to obtain
    the optimum topology of the AANN. Then, Pareto front optimization was used to
    determine the optimal setting parameters for the fabrication of the scaffolds
    with required compressive strength and porosity. The results indicate the acceptable
    potential of the evolutionary strategies for the controlling and optimization
    of the 3DP process as a complicated engineering problem.

  container-title: International Journal of Robotics Research
  page: 744-762
  volume: '34'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: We present the design and evaluation of a multi-articular soft exosuit
    that is portable, fully autonomous, and provides assistive torques to the wearer
    at the ankle and hip during walking. Traditional rigid exoskeletons can be challenging
    to perfectly align with a wearer’s biological joints and can have large inertias,
    which can lead to the wearer altering their natural motion patterns. Exosuits,
    in comparison, use textiles to create tensile forces over the body in parallel
    with the muscles, enabling them to be light and not restrict the wearer’s kinematics.
    We describe the biologically inspired design and function of our exosuit, including
    a simplified model of the suit’s architecture and its interaction with the body.
    A key feature of the exosuit is that it can generate forces passively due to the
    body’s motion, similar to the body’s ligaments and tendons. These passively generated
    forces can be supplemented by actively contracting Bowden cables using geared
    electric motors, to create peak forces in the suit of up to 200-N. We define the
    suit-human series stiffness as an important parameter in the design of the exosuit
    and measure it on several subjects, and we perform human subjects testing to determine
    the biomechanical and physiological effects of the suit. Results from a five-subject
    study showed a minimal effect on gait kinematics and an average best-case metabolic
    reduction of 6.4

  title: <span class="nocase">Climbing rough vertical surfaces with hierarchical directional
    adhesion</span>
  container-title: 2009 ieee international conference on robotics and automation
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 2675-2680
  abstract: 'Prior research in biology and mechanics has shown the importance of hierarchy
    to the performance of dry adhesive systems on rough surfaces. The gecko utilizes
    several levels of hierarchy that operate on length scales from millimeters to
    100s of nanometers in order to maneuver on smooth and rough vertical surfaces
    ranging from glass to rock. The gecko’s hierarchical system serves two main purposes:
    it permits conformation to the surface for a large effective area of contact,
    and it distributes the load evenly among contacting elements. We present a new
    two-tiered directional adhesive system that provides these capabilities for a
    gecko-inspired climbing robot. The distal features consist of wedge-shaped structures
    with a base width of 50 mum and a height of approximately 180 mum. The wedges
    are mounted atop angled cylindrical features, 380 mum in diameter by approximately
    1 mm long. Together, the proximal and distal features bend preferentially in the
    direction of inclination when loaded with a tangential force, achieving a combination
    of directional adhesion and conformation to rough surfaces. Using this system,
    a four legged robot that was previously restricted to climbing smooth surfaces
    is able to climb vertical surfaces such as a wood panels, painted metals, and
    plastics. On rougher surfaces, the two-tiered system improves adhesion by a factor
    of five compared to the wedge features alone. The hierarchical system also improved
    alignment and performance for large patch sizes.'

  container-title: Biological cybernetics
  page: 109-128
  volume: '100'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: The capability of grasping and lifting an object in a suitable, stable
    and controlled way is an outstanding feature for a robot, and thus far, one of
    the major problems to be solved in robotics. No robotic tools able to perform
    an advanced control of the grasp as, for instance, the human hand does, have been
    demonstrated to date. Due to its capital importance in science and in many applications,
    namely from biomedics to manufacturing, the issue has been matter of deep scientific
    investigations in both the field of neurophysiology and robotics. While the former
    is contributing with a profound understanding of the dynamics of real-time control
    of the slippage and grasp force in the human hand, the latter tries more and more
    to reproduce, or take inspiration by, the nature’s approach, by means of hardware
    and software technology. On this regard, one of the major constraints robotics
    has to overcome is the real-time processing of a large amounts of data generated
    by the tactile sensors while grasping, which poses serious problems to the available
    computational power. In this paper a bio-inspired approach to tactile data processing
    has been followed in order to design and test a hardware-software robotic architecture
    that works on the parallel processing of a large amount of tactile sensing signals.
    The working principle of the architecture bases on the cellular nonlinear/neural
    network (CNN) paradigm, while using both hand shape and spatial-temporal features
    obtained from an array of microfabricated force sensors, in order to control the
    sensory-motor coordination of the robotic system. Prototypical grasping tasks
    were selected to measure the system performances applied to a computer-interfaced
    robotic hand. Successful grasps of several objects, completely unknown to the
    robot, e.g. soft and deformable objects like plastic bottles, soft balls, and
    Japanese tofu, have been demonstrated.

  page: 135-157
  volume: '23'
  abstract: Many methods have been proposed for the simulation of constrained mechanical
    systems. The most obvious of these have mild instabilities and drift problems.
    Consequently, stabilization techniques have been proposed. A popular stabilization
    method is Baumgarte’s technique, but the choice of parameters to make it robust
    has been unclear in practice. Some of the simulation methods that have been proposed
    and used in computations are reviewed here, from a stability point of view. This
    involves concepts of differential-algebraic equation (DAE) and ordinary differential
    equation (ODE) invariants. An explanation of the difficulties that may be encountered
    using Baumgarte’s method is given, and a discussion of why a further quest for
    better parameter values for this method will always remain frustrating is presented.
    It is then shown how Baumgarte’s method can be improved. An efficient stabilization
    technique is proposed, which may employ explicit ODE solvers in case of nonstiff
    or highly oscillatory problems and which relates to coordinate projection methods.
    Examples of a two-link planar robotic arm and a squeezing mechanism illustrate
    the effectiveness of this new stabilization method.

  collection-number: '04'
  publisher: Princeton university press
  page: 46-2107
  volume: '46'
  abstract: 'This book provides an introduction to the basic principles and tools
    for the design and analysis of feedback systems. It is intended to serve a diverse
    audience of scientists and engineers who are interested in understanding and utilizing
    feedback in physical, biological, information and social systems.We have attempted
    to keep the mathematical prerequisites to a minimum while being careful not to
    sacrifice rigor in the process. We have also attempted to make use of examples
    from a variety of disciplines, illustrating the generality of many of the tools
    while at the same time showing how they can be applied in specific application
    domains. A major goal of this book is to present a concise and insightful view
    of the current knowledge in feedback and control systems. The field of control
    started by teaching everything that was known at the time and, as new knowledge
    was acquired, additional courses were developed to cover new techniques. A consequence
    of this evolution is that introductory courses have remained the same for many
    years, and it is often necessary to take many individual courses in order to obtain
    a good perspective on the field. In developing this book, we have attempted to
    condense the current knowledge by emphasizing fundamental concepts. We believe
    that it is important to understand why feedback is useful, to know the language
    and basic mathematics of control and to grasp the key paradigms that have been
    developed over the past half century. It is also important to be able to solve
    simple feedback problems using back-of-the-envelope techniques, to recognize fundamental
    limitations and difficult control problems and to have a feel for available design
    methods. This book was originally developed for use in an experimental course
    at Caltech involving students from a wide set of backgrounds. The course was offered
    to undergraduates at the junior and senior levels in traditional engineering disciplines,
    as well as first- and second-year graduate students in engineering and science.
    This latter group included graduate students in biology, computer science and
    physics. Over the course of several years, the text has been classroom tested
    at Caltech and at Lund University, and the feedback from many students and colleagues
    has been incorporated to help improve the readability and accessibility of the
    material. Because of its intended audience, this book is organized in a slightly
    unusual fashion compared to many other books on feedback and control. In particular,
    we introduce a number of concepts in the text that are normally reserved for second-year
    courses on control and hence often not available to students who are not control
    systems majors. This has been done at the expense of certain traditional topics,
    which we felt that the astute student could learn independently and are often
    explored through the exercises. Examples of topics that we have included are nonlinear
    dynamics, Lyapunov stability analysis, the matrix exponential, reachability and
    observability, and fundamental limits of performance and robustness. Topics that
    we have deemphasized include root locus techniques, lead/lag compensation and
    detailed rules for generating Bode and Nyquist plots by hand. Several features
    of the book are designed to facilitate its dual function as a basic engineering
    text and as an introduction for researchers in natural, information and social
    sciences. The bulk of the material is intended to be used regardless of the audience
    and covers the core principles and tools in the analysis and design of feedback
    systems. Advanced sections, marked by the â€œdangerous bendâ€� symbol shown here,
    contain material that requires a slightly more technical background, of the sort
    that would be expected of senior undergraduates in engineering. A few sections
    are marked by two dangerous bend symbols and are intended for readers with more
    specialized backgrounds, identified at the beginning of the section. To limit
    the length of the text, several standard results and extensions are given in the
    exercises, with appropriate hints toward their solutions. To further augment the
    printed material contained here, a companion web site has been developed and is
    available from the publisherâ€™s web page: http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8701.html
    The web site contains a database of frequently asked questions, supplemental examples
    and exercises, and lecture material for courses based on this text. The material
    is organized by chapter and includes a summary of the major points in the text
    as well as links to external resources. The web site also contains the source
    code for many examples in the book, as well as utilities to implement the techniques
    described in the text. Most of the code was originally written using MATLAB M-files
    but was also tested with LabView MathScript to ensure compatibility with both
    packages. Many files can also be run using other scripting languages such as Octave,
    SciLab, SysQuake and Xmath. The first half of the book focuses almost exclusively
    on state space control systems. We begin in Chapter 2 with a description of modeling
    of physical, biological and information systems using ordinary differential equations
    and difference equations. Chapter 3 presents a number of examples in some detail,
    primarily as a reference for problems that will be used throughout the text. Following
    this, Chapter 4 looks at the dynamic behavior of models, including definitions
    of stability and more complicated nonlinear behavior. We provide advanced sections
    in this chapter on Lyapunov stability analysis because we find that it is useful
    in a broad array of applications and is frequently a topic that is not introduced
    until later in oneâ€™s studies. The remaining three chapters of the first half
    of the book focus on linear systems, beginning with a description of input/output
    behavior in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we formally introduce feedback systems by
    demonstrating how state space control laws can be designed. This is followed in
    Chapter 7 by material on output feedback and estimators. Chapters 6 and 7 introduce
    the key concepts of reachability and observability, which give tremendous insight
    into the choice of actuators and sensors, whether for engineered or natural systems.
    The second half of the book presents material that is often considered to be from
    the field of â€œclassical control.â€� This includes the transfer function, introduced
    in Chapter 8, which is a fundamental tool for understanding feedback systems.
    Using transfer functions, one can begin to analyze the stability of feedback systems
    using frequency domain analysis, including the ability to reason about the closed
    loop behavior of a system from its open loop characteristics. This is the subject
    of Chapter 9, which revolves around the Nyquist stability criterion. In Chapters
    10 and 11, we again look at the design problem, focusing first on proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) controllers and then on the more general process of loop shaping. PID control
    is by far the most common design technique in control systems and a useful tool
    for any student. The chapter on frequency domain design introduces many of the
    ideas of modern control theory, including the sensitivity function. In Chapter
    12, we combine the results from the second half of the book to analyze some of
    the fundamental trade-offs between robustness and performance. This is also a
    key chapter illustrating the power of the techniques that have been developed
    and serving as an introduction for more advanced studies. The book is designed
    for use in a 10- to 15-week course in feedback systems that provides many of the
    key concepts needed in a variety of disciplines. For a 10-week course, Chapters
    1â€“2, 4â€“6 and 8â€“11 can each be covered in a weekâ€™s time, with the omission
    of some topics from the final chapters. A more leisurely course, spread out over
    14â€“15 weeks, could cover the entire book, with 2 weeks on modeling (Chapters
    2 and 3) â€” particularly for students without much background in ordinary differential
    equations â€” and 2 weeks on robust performance (Chapter 12). The mathematical
    prerequisites for the book are modest and in keeping with our goal of providing
    an introduction that serves a broad audience. We assume familiarity with the basic
    tools of linear algebra, including matrices, vectors and eigenvalues. These are
    typically covered in a sophomore-level course on the subject, and the textbooks
    by Apostol \[10\], Arnold \[13\] and Strang \[187\] can serve as good references.
    Similarly, we assume basic knowledge of differential equations, including the
    concepts of homogeneous and particular solutions for linear ordinary differential
    equations in one variable. Apostol \[10\] and Boyce and DiPrima \[42\] cover this
    material well. Finally, we also make use of complex numbers and functions and,
    in some of the advanced sections, more detailed concepts in complex variables
    that are typically covered in a junior-level engineering or physics course in
    mathematical methods. Apostol \[9\] or Stewart \[186\] can be used for the basic
    material, with Ahlfors \[6\], Marsden and Hoffman \[146\] or Saff and Snider \[172\]
    being good references for the more advanced material. We have chosen not to include
    appendices summarizing these various topics since there are a number of good books
    available. One additional choice that we felt was important was the decision not
    to rely on a knowledge of Laplace transforms in the book. While their use is by
    far the most common approach to teaching feedback systems in engineering, many
    students in the natural and information sciences may lack the necessary mathematical
    background. Since Laplace transforms are not required in any essential way, we
    have included them only in an advanced section intended to tie things together
    for students with that background. Of course, we make tremendous use of transfer
    functions, which we introduce through the notion of response to exponential inputs,'

  abstract: 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim In this paper, the design
    and manufacturing of a highly sensitive capacitive-based soft pressure sensor
    for wearable electronics applications are presented. Toward this aim, two types
    of soft conductive fabrics (knitted and woven), as well as two types of sacrificial
    particles (sugar granules and salt crystals) to create micropores within the dielectric
    layer of the capacitive sensor are evaluated, and the combined effects on the
    sensor’s overall performance are assessed. It is found that a combination of the
    conductive knit electrode and higher dielectric porosity (generated using the
    larger sugar granules) yields higher sensitivity (121 × 10−4 kPa−1) due to greater
    compressibility and the formation of air gaps between silicone elastomer and conductive
    knit electrode among the other design considerations in this study. As a practical
    demonstration, the capacitive sensor is embedded into a textile glove for grasp
    motion monitoring during activities of daily living.

    approach is presented to create highly stretchable and soft capacitance-based
    strain sensors. This involves a rapid surface modification technique based on
    direct-write laser rastering to create microstructured surfaces on prestrained
    elastomeric sheets. Then, to impart conductivity, sputtering technology is utilized
    to deposit aluminum and silver metal layers on the bottom and top surfaces of
    the elastomer sheet, creating a soft capacitor. During benchtop characterization

  abstract: In this paper we report the results of an in-depth study of engineering

    from 61 senior (fourth year) engineering students and reanalyzed protocols from
    32 freshman (first year) engineering students as they worked on two design problems.
    The design processes of these student groups were compared. Results show that
    seniors produced higher quality solutions, spent more time solving the problem,
    considered more alternative solutions and made more transitions between design
    steps than the freshmen. This dataset also includes protocols for 18 within-subject
    participants. These students participated in the study first as freshmen and later
    as seniors, affording us the opportunity to compare design process changes over
    time on the individual student level. Finally, this paper includes results for
    design process differences across the two design problems. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract: Recent advances in laminate manufacturing techniques have driven the development
    of new classes of millimeter-scale sensorized medical devices, robots capable
    of terrestrial locomotion and sustained flight, and new techniques for sensing
    and actuation. Recently, the analysis of laminate micro-devices has focused more
    manufacturability concerns and not on mechanics. Considering the nature of such
    devices, we draw from existing research in composites, origami kinematics, and
    finite element methods in order to identify issues related to sequential assembly
    and self-folding prior to fabrication as well as the stiffness of composite folded
    systems during operation. These techniques can be useful for understanding how
    such devices will bend and flex under normal operating conditions, and when added
    to new design tools like popupCAD, will give designers another means to develop
    better devices throughout the design process.

  volume: '209'
  issue: Pt 18
  abstract: 'Directional arrays of branched microscopic setae constitute a dry adhesive
    on the toes of pad-bearing geckos, nature’s supreme climbers. Geckos are easily
    and rapidly able to detach their toes as they climb. There are two known mechanisms
    of detachment: (1) on the microscale, the seta detaches when the shaft reaches
    a critical angle with the substrate, and (2) on the macroscale, geckos hyperextend
    their toes, apparently peeling like tape. This raises the question of how geckos
    prevent detachment while inverted on the ceiling, where body weight should cause
    toes to peel and setal angles to increase. Geckos use opposing feet and toes while
    inverted, possibly to maintain shear forces that prevent detachment of setae or
    peeling of toes. If detachment occurs by macroscale peeling of toes, the peel
    angle should monotonically decrease with applied force. In contrast, if adhesive
    force is limited by microscale detachment of setae at a critical angle, the toe
    detachment angle should be independent of applied force. We tested the hypothesis
    that adhesion is increased by shear force in isolated setal arrays and live gecko
    toes. We also tested the corollary hypotheses that (1) adhesion in toes and arrays
    is limited as on the microscale by a critical angle, or (2) on the macroscale
    by adhesive strength as predicted for adhesive tapes. We found that adhesion depended
    directly on shear force, and was independent of detachment angle. Therefore we
    reject the hypothesis that gecko toes peel like tape. The linear relation between
    adhesion and shear force is consistent with a critical angle of release in live
    gecko toes and isolated setal arrays, and also with our prior observations of
    single setae. We introduced a new model, frictional adhesion, for gecko pad attachment
    and compared it to existing models of adhesive contacts. In an analysis of clinging
    stability of a gecko on an inclined plane each adhesive model predicted a different
    force control strategy. The frictional adhesion model provides an explanation
    for the very low detachment forces observed in climbing geckos that does not depend
    on toe peeling.'

  volume: '209'
  issue: Pt 2
  abstract: Geckos with adhesive toe pads rapidly climb even smooth vertical surfaces.
    We challenged geckos (Hemidactylus garnotii) to climb up a smooth vertical track
    that contained a force platform. Geckos climbed vertically at up to 77 cm s(-1)
    with a stride frequency of 15 Hz using a trotting gait. During each step, whole
    body fore-aft, lateral and normal forces all decreased to zero when the animal
    attached or detached its toe pads. Peak fore-aft force was twice body weight at
    mid-step. Geckos climbed at a constant average velocity without generating decelerating
    forces on their center of mass in the direction of motion. Although mass-specific
    mechanical power to climb was ten times the value expected for level running,
    the total mechanical energy of climbing was only 5-11

  abstract: We review a large multidisciplinary effort to develop a family of autonomous
    robots capable of rapid, agile maneuvers in and around natural and artificial
    vertical terrains such as walls, cliffs, caves, trees and rubble. Our robot designs
    are inspired by (but not direct copies of) biological climbers such as cockroaches,
    geckos, and squirrels. We are incorporating advanced materials (e.g., synthetic
    gecko hairs) into these designs and fabricating them using state of the art rapid
    prototyping techniques (e.g., shape deposition manufacturing) that permit multiple
    iterations of design and testing with an effective integration path for the novel
    materials and components. We are developing novel motion control techniques to
    support dexterous climbing behaviors that are inspired by neuroethological studies
    of animals and descended from earlier frameworks that have proven analytically
    tractable and empirically sound. Our near term behavioral targets call for vertical
    climbing on soft (e.g., bark) or rough surfaces and for ascents on smooth, hard
    steep inclines (e.g., 60 degree slopes on metal or glass sheets) at one body length
    per second.

  abstract: Mechanisms utilizing rigid links and relatively small flexural joints
    are very suitable for fabrication at the meso scale. The Micromechanical Flying
    Insect (MFI) project at UC Berkeley has developed a simple fabrication method
    which works very well at the scale where the links are a few millimeters in length
    and the flexures are few hundred microns in length. Previous analysis has concentrated
    on the geometry of the composite material links for creating rigid links. Recently,
    we have found that for useful performance, detailed analysis is required of the
    flexures also. This paper presents a brief analysis of the issues involved in
    the design of the flexural components of such mechanisms.

  container-title: IEEE international conference on rehabilitation robotics
  publisher: IEEE Computer Society
  page: 583-588
  volume: 2015-Septe
  abstract: A novel modular variable stiffness actuator (VSA), for use in the knee
    joint of lower limb exoskeletons, is presented. The actuator consists of a combination
    of a spindle-driven MACCEPA (Mechanically Adjustable Compliance and Controllable
    Equilibrium Position Actuator) and a spring acting in parallel, (dis)engaged by
    means of a simple on/off mechanism depending on the phase of the gait cycle. Such
    design approach is inspired by two clearly distinctive gait phases of a knee joint,
    one with a high velocity and low torque, and another one with low velocity and
    high torque profiles. By tackling each of these two phases separately, energy
    consumption and torque requirements of an active part of the actuator have been
    decreased, while keeping the size and the weight of the actuator at a reasonable
    size for use in wearable robots (WR).

  volume: '60'
  issue: '8'
  abstract: 'Spinning tops and yo-yos have long fascinated cultures around the world
    with their unexpected, graceful motions that seemingly elude gravity. Yet, due
    to the exceeding difficulty of creating stably spinning objects of asymmetric
    shape in a manual trial-and-error process, there has been little departure from
    rotationally symmetric designs. With modern 3D printing technologies, however,
    we can manufacture shapes of almost unbounded complexity at the press of a button,
    shifting this design complexity toward computation. In this article, we describe
    an algorithm to generate designs for spinning objects by optimizing their mass
    distribution: as input, the user provides a solid 3D model and a desired axis
    of rotation. Our approach then modifies the interior mass distribution such that
    the principal directions of the moment of inertia align with the target rotation
    frame. To create voids inside the model, we represent its volume with an adaptive
    multiresolution voxelization and optimize the discrete voxel fill values using
    a continuous, nonlinear formulation. We further optimize for rotational stability
    by maximizing the dominant principal moment. Our method is well-suited for a variety
    of 3D printed models, ranging from characters to abstract shapes. We demonstrate
    tops and yo-yos that spin surprisingly stably despite their asymmetric appearance.'

  abstract: A wearable robot is the robotic system capable of augmenting or amplifying
    the wearer’s muscle strength. To imitate human arms, the recognition of muscle
    stiffness and the reflection of the motion are very important. In this paper,
    the upper limb of the wearer is bandaged with the pneumatic muscle stiffness sensor
    (MSS), and the wearer’s intention is estimated by recognizing the movement of
    the muscle. In addition, a variable stiffness actuator (VSA) is used to imitate
    the predicted motion of the wearer and simultaneously to unburden the weight by
    increasing its stiffness. It is shown that the proposed system is capable of distinguishing
    between the wearer’s intention and the external load. 2013 IEEE.

  container-title: The Journal of Physiology
  page: 225-241

  abstract: 1\. Recordings were made of local field potential (slow waves) and pyramidal
    tract neurone (PTN) discharge from pairs of sites separated by a horizontal distance
    of up to 1.5 mm in the primary motor cortex of two conscious macaque monkeys performing
    a precision grip task. 2. In both monkeys, the slow wave recordings showed bursts
    of oscillations in the 20-30 Hz range. Spectral analysis revealed that the oscillations
    were coherent between the two simultaneously recorded cortical sites. In the monkey
    from which most data were recorded, the mean frequency of peak coherence was 23.4
    Hz. 3. Coherence in this frequency range was also seen between cortical slow wave
    recordings and rectified EMG of hand and forearm muscles active during the task,
    and between pairs of rectified EMGs. 4. The dynamics of the coherence were investigated
    by analysing short, quasi-stationary data segments aligned relative to task performance.
    This revealed that the 20-30 Hz coherent oscillations were present mainly during
    the hold phase of the precision grip task. 5. The spikes of identified PTNs were
    used to compile spike-triggered averages of the slow wave recordings. Oscillations
    were seen in 11/17 averages of the slow wave recorded on the same electrode as
    the triggering spike, and 11/17 averages of the slow wave recorded on the distant
    electrode. The mean period of these oscillations was 45.8 ms. 6. It is concluded
    that oscillations in the range 20-30 Hz are present in monkey motor cortex, are
    coherent between spatially separated cortical sites, and encompass the pyramidal
    tract output neurones. They are discernable in the EMG of active muscles, and
    show a consistent task-dependent modulation.

  abstract: 'The objective of this study was to characterize the temporal relationship
    between hand stiffness and task performance during adaptation to a brief contact
    task that required precision at the time of contact. The experiment required subjects
    to control the vertical position of a paddle on a computer display by grasping
    a robot’s instrumented handle, with the goal of intercepting a virtual ball within
    1 mm from the paddle center. A force transient was applied to the hand immediately
    after the ball-paddle impact to estimate the intrinsic hand impedance. There were
    two main results: 1) more trials were required for a brief contact task to find
    a low-energy strategy when compared with tasks that received feedback through
    the entire movement trajectory and 2) when the whole course of adaptation is long
    for brief contact tasks, viscoelastic forces were increased to achieve the task
    goal before the energy reduction initiated. Also, as the accuracy requirement
    was increased by changing the gain between handle and paddle motion through visual
    amplification, peak stiffness increased and occurred later, indicating that higher
    energy strategies are used for longer when the task’s accuracy requirements were
    increased. These results indicated that task performance may be prioritized over
    energy reduction for a brief contact task.'

  abstract: Stony reefs in shallow water support abundant and species-rich animal
    communities, and may thus attract top predators such as the harbour porpoise.
    In summer 2008, the nature res- toration project Blue Reef re-established 45000
    m2 of cavernous stony reef at Læsø Trindel in the northern Kattegat, Denmark.
    To investigate whether the re-established reef attracts harbour por- poises, the
    acoustic activity of porpoises was monitored by static acoustic data loggers,
    T-PODs, before and after the restoration project. T-PODs were placed at the Læsø
    Trindel reef and at a ref- erence station 10 km away between June and August from
    2006 to 2012. Results showed that por- poise activity increased significantly
    at Læsø Trindel reef after the reconstruction in 2008. The number of minutes with
    porpoise recordings (PPM) increased on average from 9.5 PPM per day in 2006 to
    a maximum in 2010 (15.2 PPM per day) followed by a small decrease (12.75 PPM per
    day in 2012). An increase in mean encounter duration from 3.0 min in 2006 to 4.7
    min in 2010 (3.7 min in 2012) showed that porpoises not only appeared more often,
    but also stayed longer at Læsø Trindel. Furthermore, there was a striking diel
    pattern in porpoise activity at Læsø Trindel, with significantly higher activity
    during the night. This pattern became increasingly apparent over the study period.
    At the reference station, in contrast, most activity took place during the day
    through- out the study. The results suggest that these changes reflect a new food
    source which occurs at night on the re-established stony reef and is exploited
    by the porpoises.

  abstract: Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated figures are based
    exclusively on reduced-coordinate formulations. This pa- per describes a general,
    non-iterative linear-time simulationmethod based instead on Lagrange multipliers.
    Lagrange multiplier meth- ods are important for computer graphics applications
    because they bypass the difficult (and often intractable) problem of parameter-
    izing a systems degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality constraints
    acting between pairs of bodies, the method takes O(n) time to compute the systems
    dynamics. The method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no assumptions about
    the con- straints topology are needed. Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can
    be of various dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate ap- proaches, nonholonomic
    (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional
    constraints which induce loops and/or handle inequalities can be accommodated
    with cost O(kn). Thismakes it practical to simulate complicated, closed- loop
    articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at interactive rates. A complete
    description of a sample implementation is pro- vided in pseudocode.

  abstract: '2018 Barasuol, Villarreal-Magana, Sangiah, Frigerio, Baker, Morgan, Medrano-Cerda,
    Caldwell and Semini. Hydraulic actuation is the most widely used alternative to
    electric motors for legged robots and manipulators. It is often selected for its
    high power density, robustness and high-bandwidth control performance that allows
    the implementation of force/impedance control. Force control is crucial for robots
    that are in contact with the environment, since it enables the implementation
    of active impedance and whole body control that can lead to a better performance
    in known and unknown environments. This paper presents the hydraulic Integrated
    Smart Actuator (ISA) developed by Moog in collaboration with IIT, as well as smart
    manifolds for rotary hydraulic actuators. The ISA consists of an additive-manufactured
    body containing a hydraulic cylinder, servo valve, pressure/position/load/temperature
    sensing, overload protection and electronics for control and communication. The
    ISA v2 and ISA v5 have been specifically designed to fit into the legs of IIT’s
    hydraulic quadruped robots HyQ and HyQ-REAL, respectively. The key features of
    these components tackle 3 of today’s main challenges of hydraulic actuation for
    legged robots through: (1) built-in controllers running inside integrated electronics
    for high-performance control, (2) low-leakage servo valves for reduced energy
    losses, and (3) compactness thanks to metal additive manufacturing. The main contributions
    of this paper are the derivation of the representative dynamic models of these
    highly integrated hydraulic servo actuators, a control architecture that allows
    for high-bandwidth force control and their experimental validation with application-specific
    trajectories and tests. We believe that this is the first work that presents additive-manufactured,
    highly integrated hydraulic smart actuators for robotics.'

  container-title: ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software
  page: 469-483
  volume: '22'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains
    the points. This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines
    the two-dimensional Quick- hull Algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond
    Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex
    hull and Delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm
    runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it uses less memory.
    Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are
    well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic,
    this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe a solution to
    this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions.
    The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls
    of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.

  abstract: \[Biomimetics, review, robotics, electroactive polymers (EAP), actuators,
    artificial mascle\]Humans throughout history have always sought to mimic the appearance,
    mobility, functionality, intelligent operation, and thinking process of biological
    creatures. This field of biologically inspired technology, having the moniker
    biomimetics, has evolved from making static copies of human and animals in the
    form of statues to the emergence of robots that operate with realistic behavior.
    Imagine a person walking towards you where suddenly you notice something weird
    about him – he is not real but rather he is a robot. Your reaction would probably
    be “I can’t believable it but this robot looks very real” just as you would react
    to an artificial flower that is a good imitation. You may even proceed and touch
    the robot to check if your assessment is correct but, as oppose to the flower
    case, the robot may be programmed to respond physical and verbally. This science
    fiction scenario could become a reality as the current trend continues in developing
    biologically inspired technologies. Technology evolution led to such fields as
    artificial muscles, artificial intelligence, and artificial vision as well as
    biomimetic capabilities in materials science, mechanics, electronics, computing
    science, information technology and many others. This paper will review the state
    of the art and challenges to biologically-inspired technologies and the role that
    EAP is expected to play as the technology evolves.

  abstract: This paper introduces a novel underactuated anthropomorphic gripper for
    prosthetic applications. In order to extend the grasping capabilities of underactuated
    prosthetic grippers and improve the force transmission ratio, a mechanical lever
    is mounted inside the palm that allows a proper distribution of the forces and
    provides mechanical advantage. A static model is developed and the possibilities
    offered by the lever transmission are investigated. Also, a compact mechanism
    is introduced to synchronize the motion of the four fingers. Additionally, a mechanical
    selector is designed that functions as a means of mechanically programming the
    motion of the fingers by selectively blocking their closing motion. Finally, a
    prototype, including all the above features, is described and experimental validation
    is briefly reported.

  abstract: A voxel-based shape representation when integrated with an evolutionary
    algorithm offers a number of potential advantages for shape optimization. Topology
    need not be predefined, geometric constraints are easily imposed and, with adequate
    resolution, any shape can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy. However, lack
    of boundary smoothness, length of chromosome, and inclusion of small holes in
    the final shape have been stated as problems with this representation. This paper
    describes two experiments performed in an attempt to address some of these problems.
    First, a design problem with only a small computational cost of evaluating candidate
    shapes was used as a testbed for designing genetic operators for this shape representation.
    Second, these operators were refined for a design problem using a more costly
    finite element evaluation. It was concluded that the voxel representation can,
    with careful design of genetic operators, be useful in shape optimization.

  abstract: Roboticists have begun to design biologically inspired robots with soft
    or partially soft bodies, which have the potential to be more robust and adaptable,
    and safer for human interaction, than traditional rigid robots. However, key challenges
    in the design and manufacture of soft robots include the complex fabrication processes
    and the interfacing of soft and rigid components. We used multimaterial three-dimensional
    (3D) printing to manufacture a combustion-powered robot whose body transitions
    from a rigid core to a soft exterior. This stiffness gradient, spanning three
    orders of magnitude in modulus, enables reliable interfacing between rigid driving
    components (controller, battery, etc.) and the primarily soft body, and also enhances
    performance. Powered by the combustion of butane and oxygen, this robot is able
    to perform untethered jumping.

  abstract: Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an
    important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule
    and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand
    docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically
    improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides.
    In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based
    implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring
    poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms)
    increased from 21

  abstract: When a given system of differential equations is integrated by numerical
    and automatic integration it may occur that the solution at hand satisfies an
    analytical relation which is a corollary of the differential equations but which
    is unknown to the automatic computer. An example of such a relation is the energy
    relation in conservative systems or the analytical relation generated by an outer
    holonomic or non-holonomic constraint provided the Lagrange equations of the first
    kind are used. It is shown that, in general, the computed numerical values of
    the solution satisfy such analytic relations with poor accuracy. The aim of the
    paper is to show how the analytical relations can be satisfied in a stabilized
    manner in order to improve the numerical accuracy of the solution of the differential
    equations. The proposed method leads to a modified differential system which is
    often stable in the sense of Ljapunov, whereas the original system is unstable.

  abstract: This paper presents a new method for the integration of the equationsmotion
    of constrained multibody systems in descriptor form. Theis based on the penalty-Augmented
    Lagrangian formulation andmass-orthogonal projections for the solution to satisfy
    theconstraint conditions. The number of equations being solvedequal to the number
    of states, and does not depend on the numberconstraint conditions. Therefore,
    the method is particularly suitablesystems with redundant constraints, singular
    configurations orchanges. The major advantage of the new method relies onfact
    that for a low computational cost, the constraints in positions,and accelerations
    are satisfied to machine precision duringnumerical integration. This process is
    efficiently done by meansa mass-orthogonal projection without the need for coordinate
    partitioningreduction to a minimum set of coordinates. The projection schemefor
    a more accurate and robust integration of the equationsmotion since constraint
    violations constitute one of the primaryof numerical errors and instabilities
    during the integration. The proposed projection is also applied to the classicalapproach,
    thus eliminating the need for further stabilizationwell as the selection of parameters

    that including a hidden state estimate of learner engagement increased the accuracy
    and predictive power of the models, both within and across tutoring sessions.
    Groups of students with distinct engagement trajectories were identified, and
    findings were replicated in two independent samples. These results suggest that
    modeling learner engagement may help to increase the effectiveness of intelligent
    tutoring systems since it was observed that engagement trajectories were not predicted
    by prior math achievement of students.

  abstract: 'Kent Beck’s eXtreme Programming eXplained provides an intriguing high-level
    overview of the author’s Extreme Programming (XP) software development methodology.
    Written for IS managers, project leaders, or programmers, this guide provides
    a glimpse at the principles behind XP and its potential advantages for small-
    to mid-size software development teams. The book intends to describe what XP is,
    its guiding principles, and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids case
    studies and concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy of XP. Instead, it
    demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit testing, programming in pairs,
    communal ownership of code, and customer input on software to motivate code improvement
    during the development process. As the author notes, these principles are not
    new, but when they’re combined their synergy fosters a new and arguably better
    way to build and maintain software. Throughout the book, the author presents and
    explains these principles, such as "rapid feedback" and "play to win," which form
    the basis of XP. Generally speaking, XP changes the way programmers work. The
    book is good at delineating new roles for programmers and managers who Beck calls
    "coaches." The most striking characteristic of XP is that programmers work in
    pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic part of the coding process. In a later
    section, the author even shows where XP works and where it doesn’t and offers
    suggestions for migrating teams and organizations over to the XP process. In the
    afterword, the author recounts the experiences that led him to develop and refine
    XP, an insightful section that should inspire any organization to adopt XP. This
    book serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of XP for
    the manager or programmer who wants a potentially better way to build software.
    -Richard Dragan Topics covered: Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology,
    principles, XP team roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software
    lifecycle, and adopting XP. Software development projects can be fun, productive,
    and even daring. Yet they can consistently deliver value to a business and remain
    under control. Extreme Programming (XP) was conceived and developed to address
    the specific needs of software development conducted by small teams in the face
    of vague and changing requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges
    many conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that the cost of
    changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically over the course of
    time. XP recognizes that projects have to work to achieve this reduction in cost
    and exploit the savings once they have been earned. Fundamentals of XP include:
    Distinguishing between the decisions to be made by business interests and those
    to be made by project stakeholders. Writing unit tests before programming and
    keeping all of the tests running at all times. Integrating and testing the whole
    system-several times a day. Producing all software in pairs, two programmers at
    one screen. Starting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves to
    add needed flexibility and remove unneeded complexity. Putting a minimal system
    into production quickly and growing it in whatever directions prove most valuable.
    Why is XP so controversial? Some sacred cows don’t make the cut in XP: Don’t force
    team members to specialize and become analysts, architects, programmers, testers,
    and integrators-every XP programmer participates in all of these critical activities
    every day. Don’t conduct complete up-front analysis and design-an XP project starts
    with a quick analysis of the entire system, and XP programmers continue to make
    analysis and design decisions throughout development. Develop infrastructure and
    frameworks as you develop your application, not up-front-delivering business value
    is the heartbeat that drives XP projects. Don’t write and maintain implementation
    documentation-communication in XP projects occurs face-to-face, or through efficient
    tests and carefully written code. You may love XP or you may hate it, but Extreme
    Programming Explained will force you to take a fresh look at how you develop software.'

  abstract: Paired pectoral fins that are capable of rowing motions are an important
    actuation mechanism for robotic fish. Existing work in this area typically adopts
    a rigid connection between the actuator and the pectoral fins, which requires
    a faster actuation speed in the power stroke than in the recovery stroke to produce
    a net thrust or moment. In addition to increasing the control complexity, the
    latter requirement leads to slow robot speeds due to prolonged deceleration during
    the recovery stroke. In this paper, we propose the design of a novel flexible
    passive joint that connects the servomotor arm to the pectoral fin, to overcome
    the aforementioned problem. A dynamic model is developed for the joint and for
    a robotic fish equipped with such joints. The design and the model are evaluated
    with extensive experimental results. With symmetric actuation patterns during
    the power and recovery strokes, the robotic fish with the proposed joints shows
    clear speed advantage over the case involving rigid joints and asymmetric actuation.
    Motivated by the need for design optimization, the model is further utilized to
    investigate the influence of the joint length and stiffness on the robot locomotion
    performance and efficiency. It is found that, for low fin-beat frequencies, longer
    or more flexible joints lead to higher speeds, and the trend is reversed at high
    fin-beat frequencies. On the other hand, while the mechanical efficiency shows
    a decreasing trend when the frequency increases, it is higher with shorter joints.
    These findings suggest the utility of the proposed model for multiobjective design
    of the joint and its operating frequency.

  issue: '2513'
  abstract: Many studies have shown that students learn best when a variety of teaching
    methods are used, and that different students respond best to different methods.
    To this end, computers are being used more and more as teaching tools, to provide
    students with a wider variety of learning experiences. These approaches include
    multimedia presentations, computerized question-and-answer sessions, and some
    quite realistic simulations of situations too complex, costly, or hazardous to
    bring into the classroom. This paper addresses the application of virtual reality
    as a new educational tool, designed to get students more deeply immersed in the
    computer simulations, and to present educational experiences not possible using
    other methods. Details of the virtual reality based educational program Vicher
    are presented, along with a discussion of our experiences using the program as
    part of an undergraduate chemical reaction engineering course.

  page: 2831-2837
  abstract: To engage in cooperative activities with human partners, robots have to
    possess basic interactive abilities and skills. However, programming such interactive
    skills is a challenging task, as each interaction partner can have different timing
    or an alternative way of executing movements. In this paper, we propose to learn
    interaction skills by observing how two humans engage in a similar task. To this
    end, we introduce a new representation called Interaction Primitives. Interaction
    primitives build on the framework of dynamic motor primitives (DMPs) by maintaining
    a distribution over the parameters of the DMP. With this distribution, we can
    learn the inherent correlations of cooperative activities which allow us to infer
    the behavior of the partner and to participate in the cooperation. We will provide
    algorithms for synchronizing and adapting the behavior of humans and robots during
    joint physical activities.

  abstract: We present a universal crease pattern–known in geometry as the tetrakis
    tiling and in origami as box pleating–that can fold into any object made up of
    unit cubes joined face-to-face (polycubes). More precisely, there is one universal
    finite crease pattern for each number n of unit cubes that need to be folded.
    This result contrasts previous universality results for origami, which require
    a different crease pattern for each target object, and confirms intuition in the
    origami community that box pleating is a powerful design technique.

  title: <span class="nocase">Geometrically controlled snapping transitions in shells
    with curved creases</span>
  volume: '112'
  issue: '36'
  abstract: Curvature and mechanics are intimately connected for thin materials, and
    this coupling between geometry and physical properties is readily seen in folded
    structures from intestinal villi and pollen grains, to wrinkled membranes and
    programmable metamaterials. While the well-known rules and mechanisms behind folding
    a flat surface have been used to create deployable structures and shape transformable
    materials, folding of curved shells is still not fundamentally understood. Curved
    shells naturally deform by simultaneously bending and stretching, and while this
    coupling gives them great stability for engineering applications, it makes folding
    a surface of arbitrary curvature a non-trivial task. Here we discuss the geometry
    of folding a creased shell, and demonstrate theoretically the conditions under
    which it may fold continuously. When these conditions are violated we show, using
    experiments and simulations, that shells undergo rapid snapping motion to fold
    from one stable configuration to another. Although material asymmetry is a proven
    mechanism for creating this bifurcation of stability, for the case of a creased
    shell, the inherent geometry itself serves as a barrier to folding. We discuss
    here how two fundamental geometric concepts, creases and curvature, combine to
    allow rapid transitions from one stable state to another. Independent of material
    system and length scale, the design rule that we introduce here explains how to
    generate snapping transitions in arbitrary surfaces, thus facilitating the creation
    of programmable multi-stable materials with fast actuation capabilities.

  container-title: Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering
  page: 197-224
  volume: '71'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Optimal shape design of structural elements based on boundary variations
    results in final designs that are topologically equivalent to the initial choice
    of design, and general, stable computational schemes for this approach often require
    some kind of remeshing of the finite element approximation of the analysis problem.
    This paper presents a methodology for optimal shape design where both these drawbacks
    can be avoided. The method is related to modern production techniques and consists
    of computing the optimal distribution in space of an anisotropic material that
    is constructed by introducing an infimum of periodically distributed small holes
    in a given homogeneous, isotropic material, with the requirement that the resulting
    structure can carry the given loads as well as satisfy other design requirements.
    The computation of effective material properties for the anisotropic material
    is carried out using the method of homogenization. Computational results are presented
    and compared with results obtained by boundary variations. 1988.

    dental crowns, and artificial limbs, as well as in bridge manufacturing. 3-D printing
    has been compared to such disruptive technologies as digital books and music downloads
    that enable consumers to order their selections online, allow firms to profitably
    serve small market segments, and enable companies to operate with little or no
    unsold finished goods inventory. Some experts have also argued that 3-D printing
    will significantly reduce the advantages of producing small lot sizes in low-wage

  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  abstract: Even the simplest of animals exhibit behavioral sequences with complex
    temporal dynamics. Prominent among the proposed organizing principles for these
    dynamics has been the idea of a hierarchy, wherein the movements an animal makes
    can be understood as a set of nested subclusters. Although this type of organization
    holds potential advantages in terms of motion control and neural circuitry, measurements
    demonstrating this for an animal’s entire behavioral repertoire have been limited
    in scope and temporal complexity. Here, we use a recently developed unsupervised
    technique to discover and track the occurrence of all stereotyped behaviors performed
    by fruit flies moving in a shallow arena. Calculating the optimally predictive
    representation of the fly’s future behaviors, we show that fly behavior exhibits
    multiple time scales and is organized into a hierarchical structure that is indicative
    of its underlying behavioral programs and its changing internal states.

  abstract: A frequent assumption in behavioural science is that most of an animal’s
    activities can be described in terms of a small set of stereotyped motifs. Here,
    we introduce a method for mapping an animal’s actions, relying only upon the underlying
    structure of postural movement data to organize and classify behaviours. Applying
    this method to the ground-based behaviour of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster,
    we find that flies perform stereotyped actions roughly 50 discovering over 100
    distinguishable, stereotyped behavioural states. These include multiple modes
    of locomotion and grooming. We use the resulting measurements as the basis for
    identifying subtle sex-specific behavioural differences and revealing the low-dimensional
    nature of animal motions.

    Thus, our ability to rapidly create robotic systems requires a synergy between
    these diverse disciplines. In the near future, new paradigms and tools will be
    needed for on-demand design generation; new fabrication methods will be needed
    to realize custom electromechanical devices; and new algorithms and programming
    languages will be necessary to define, evaluate, and optimize behavioral specifications
    and designs. In this article, we assess the main challenges, problems, vision,
    and future steps on the topic of codesign and rapid fabrication of robotic systems.

  abstract: In this paper, an attempt at summarizing the evolution and the state of
    the art in the field of robot hands is made. In such exposition, a critical evaluation
    of what in the author’s view are the leading ideas and emerging trends is privileged
    with respect to exhaustiveness of citations. The survey is focused mainly on three
    types of functional requirements a machine hand can be assigned in an artificial
    system, namely, manipulative dexterity, grasp robustness, and human operability.
    A basic distinction is made between hands designed for mimicking the human anatomy
    and physiology,and hands designed to meet restricted, practical requirements.
    In the latter domain, arguments are presented in favor of a -minimalistic” attitude
    in the design of hands for practical applications, i.e., use the least number
    of actuators, the simplest set of sensors, etc., for a given task. To achieve
    this rather obvious engineering goal is a challenge to our community. The paper
    illustrates some of the new sometimes difficult, problems that are brought about
    by building and controlling simpler, more practical devices

  page: 3153-61
  volume: '366'
  issue: '1581'
  abstract: We report on recent work in modelling the process of grasping and active
    touch by natural and artificial hands. Starting from observations made in human
    hands about the correlation of degrees of freedom in patterns of more frequent
    use (postural synergies), we consider the implications of a geometrical model
    accounting for such data, which is applicable to the pre-grasping phase occurring
    when shaping the hand before actual contact with the grasped object. To extend
    applicability of the synergy model to study force distribution in the actual grasp,
    we introduce a modified model including the mechanical compliance of the hand’s
    musculotendinous system. Numerical results obtained by this model indicate that
    the same principal synergies observed from pre-grasp postural data are also fundamental
    in achieving proper grasp force distribution. To illustrate the concept of synergies
    in the dual domain of haptic sensing, we provide a review of models of how the
    complexity and heterogeneity of sensory information from touch can be harnessed
    in simplified, tractable abstractions. These abstractions are amenable to fast
    processing to enable quick reflexes as well as elaboration of high-level percepts.
    Applications of the synergy model to the design and control of artificial hands
    and tactile sensors are illustrated.

    based on force/torque measurements at fingertips, is provided. A method for using
    sensory feedback in the control of grasp forces to augment grasp robustness against
    slippage is discussed with respect to a simple grasp type; simulation and experimental
    data are provided. The possible generalization of this sensor-driven approach

  issue: '4913'
  abstract: 'The scaling of bone and muscle geometry in mammals suggests that peak
    stresses (ratio of force to cross-sectional area) acting in these two support
    elements increase with increasing body size. Observations of stresses acting in
    the limb bones of different sized mammals during strenuous activity, however,
    indicate that peak bone stress is independent of size (maintaining a safety factor
    of between 2 and 4). It appears that similar peak bone stresses and muscle stresses
    in large and small mammals are achieved primarily by a size-dependent change in
    locomotor limb posture: small animals run with crouched postures, whereas larger
    species run more upright. By adopting an upright posture, large animals align
    their limbs more closely with the ground reaction force, substantially reducing
    the forces that their muscles must exert (proportional to body mass) and hence,
    the forces that their bones must resist, to counteract joint moments. This change
    in limb posture to maintain locomotor stresses within safe limits, however, likely
    limits the maneuverability and accelerative capability of large animals.'

  container-title: The Journal of experimental biology
  page: 3387-3396
  volume: '202'
  issue: Pt 23
  abstract: 'Much of what we know about animal locomotion is derived from studies
    examining animals moving within a single, homogeneous environment, at a steady
    speed and along a flat grade. As a result, the issue of how musculoskeletal function
    might shift to accommodate variability within the external environment has remained
    relatively unexplored. One possibility is that locomotor muscles are differentially
    recruited depending upon the environment in which the animal is moving. A second
    possibility is that the same muscles are recruited, but that they are activated
    in a different manner so that their contractile function differs according to
    environment. Finally, it is also possible that, in some cases, animals may not
    need to alter their musculoskeletal function to move under different external
    conditions. In this case, however, the mechanical behavior appropriate for one
    environmental condition may constrain locomotor performance in another. To begin
    to explore the means by which animals accommodate variable conditions in their
    environment, we present three case studies examining how musculoskeletal systems
    function to allow locomotion under variable conditions: (1) eels undulating through
    water and across land, (2) turkeys running on level and inclined surfaces, and
    (3) ducks using their limbs to walk and to paddle. In all three of these examples,
    the mechanical behavior of some muscle(s) involved in locomotion are altered,
    although to different degrees and in different ways. In the running turkeys, the
    mechanical function of a major ankle extensor muscle shifts from contracting isometrically
    on a flat surface (producing little work and power), to shortening actively during
    contraction on an uphill gradient (increasing the amount of work and power generated).
    In the ducks, the major ankle extensor undergoes the same general pattern of activation
    and shortening in water and on land, except that the absolute levels of muscle
    stress and strain and work output are greater during terrestrial locomotion. In
    eels, a transition to land elicits changes in electromyographic duty cycles and
    the relative timing of muscle activation, suggesting some alteration in the functional
    mechanics of the underlying musculature. Only by studying muscle function in animals
    moving under more variable conditions can we begin to characterize the functional
    breadth of the vertebrate musculoskeletal system and understand more fully its
    evolutionary design.'

  container-title: European Journal of Neuroscience
  page: 3276-3286
  volume: '11'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to localize brain
    areas active during manipulation of complex objects. In one experiment subjects
    were required to manipulate complex objects for exploring their macrogeometric
    features as compared to manipulation of a simple smooth object (a sphere). In
    a second experiment subjects were asked to manipulate complex objects and to silently
    name them upon recognition as compared to manipulation of complex not recognizable
    objects without covert naming. Manipulation of complex objects resulted in an
    activation of ventral premotor cortex \[Brodmann’s area (BA) 44\], of a region
    in the intraparietal sulcus (most probably corresponding to the anterior intraparietal
    area in the monkey), of area SII and of a sector of the superior parietal lobule.
    When the objects were covertly named additional activations were found in the
    opercular part of BA 44 and in the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus
    (BA 45). We suggest that a fronto-parietal circuit for manipulation of objects
    exists in humans and involves basically the same areas as in the monkey. It is
    proposed that area SII analyses the intrinsic object characteristics whilst the
    superior parietal lobule is related to kinaesthesia.

  container-title: Neurology
  page: 1253-1259
  volume: '50'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: It has been shown in nonhuman primates that the posterior parietal cortex
    is involved in coordination of arm and eye movements in space, whereas the anterior
    intraparietal area in the anterior lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus plays
    a crucial role in fine finger movements, such as grasping. In this study we show
    by optoelectronic movement recordings that patients with cortical lesions involving
    the anterior lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus have selective deficits
    in the coordination of finger movements required for object grasping, whereas
    reaching is much less disturbed. Patients with parietal lesions sparing the cortex
    lining the anterior intraparietal sulcus showed intact grasping behavior. Complementary
    evidence was obtained from functional MRI in normal control subjects showing a
    specific activation of the anterior lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus during
    grasping. In conclusion, this combined lesion and activation study suggests that
    the anterior lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus, possibly including the
    human homologue of the anterior intraparietal area, mediates the processing of
    sensorimotor integration of precisely tuned finger movements in humans.

  title-short: DASH
  container-title: 2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and
    Systems
  page: 2683-2689
  abstract: DASH is a small, lightweight, power autonomous robot capable of running
    at speeds up to 15 body lengths per second (see video). Drawing inspiration from
    biomechanics, DASH has a sprawled posture and uses an alternating tripod gait
    to achieve dynamic open-loop horizontal locomotion. The kinematic design which
    uses only a single drive motor and allows for a high power density is presented.
    The design is implemented using a scaled Smart Composite Manufacturing (SCM) process.
    Evidence is given that DASH runs with a gait that can be characterized using the
    spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. In addition to being fast, DASH
    is also well suited to surviving falls from large heights, due to the uniquely
    compliant nature of its structure.

  title: <span class="nocase">Dynamic climbing of near-vertical smooth surfaces</span>
  container-title: IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems
  page: 286-292
  abstract: A 10 cm hexapedal robot is adapted to dynamically climb near-vertical
    smooth surfaces. A gecko-inspired adhesive is mounted with an elastomer tendon
    and polymer loop to a remote-center-of-motion ankle that allows rapid engagement
    with the surface and minimizes peeling moments on the adhesive. The maximum velocity
    possible while climbing decreases as the incline gets closer to vertical, with
    the robot able to achieve speeds of 10 cm second-1 at a 70-degree incline. A model
    is implemented to describe the effect of incline angle on climbing speed and,
    together with high-speed video evidence, reveals that climbing velocity is limited
    by robot dynamics and adhesive properties and not by power.

    prioritise leg safety and economy on uneven terrain</span>'
  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 3786-3796
  volume: '217'
  issue: '21'
  abstract: Cursorial ground birds are paragons of bipedal running that span a 500-fold
    mass range from quail to ostrich. Here we investigate the task-level control priorities
    of cursorial birds by analysing how they negotiate single-step obstacles that
    create a conflict between body stability (attenuating deviations in body motion)
    and consistent leg force-length dynamics (for economy and leg safety). We also
    test the hypothesis that control priorities shift between body stability and leg
    safety with increasing body size, reflecting use of active control to overcome
    size-related challenges. Weight-support demands lead to a shift towards straighter
    legs and stiffer steady gait with increasing body size, but it remains unknown
    whether non-steady locomotor priorities diverge with size. We found that all measured
    species used a consistent obstacle negotiation strategy, involving unsteady body
    dynamics to minimise fluctuations in leg posture and loading across multiple steps,
    not directly prioritising body stability. Peak leg forces remained remarkably
    consistent across obstacle terrain, within 0.35 body weights of level running
    for obstacle heights from 0.1 to 0.5 times leg length. All species used similar
    stance leg actuation patterns, involving asymmetric force-length trajectories
    and posture-dependent actuation to add or remove energy depending on landing conditions.
    We present a simple stance leg model that explains key features of avian bipedal
    locomotion, and suggests economy as a key priority on both level and uneven terrain.
    We suggest that running ground birds target the closely coupled priorities of
    economy and leg safety as the direct imperatives of control, with adequate stability
    achieved through appropriately tuned intrinsic dynamics.

  abstract: 'We propose a universal approach to the problem of computer modeling of
    shapes with continuously varying material properties satisfying prescribed material
    conditions on a finite collection of material features and global constraints.
    The central notion is a parameterization of space by distances from the material
    features - either exactly or approximately. Functions of such distances provide
    a systematic and intuitive means for modeling of desired material distributions
    as they arise in design, manufacturing, analysis and optimization of components
    with varying material properties. The proposed framework subsumes and generalizes
    a number of earlier proposals for heterogeneous material modeling. It is theoretically
    complete in the sense that it allows representation of all material property functions.
    We demonstrate that the approach can be implemented within the existing framework
    of solid modeling and its numerous advantages, including: precise and intuitive
    control using explicit, analytic, differential, and integral constraints specified
    on the native geometry; guaranteed smoothness and analytic properties without
    meshing; and applicability to material features of arbitrary dimension, shape,
    and topology. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.'

  container-title: Journal of Biomechanics
  page: 1217-1227
  volume: '22'
  issue: 11-12
  abstract: A simple spring-mass model consisting of a massless spring attached to
    a point mass describes the interdependency of mechanical parameters characterizing
    running and hopping of humans as a function of speed. The bouncing mechanism itself
    results in a confinement of the free parameter space where solutions can be found.
    In particular, bouncing frequency and vertical displacement are closely related.
    Only a few parameters, such as the vector of the specific landing velocity and
    the specific leg length, are sufficient to determine the point of operation of
    the system. There are more physiological constraints than independent parameters.
    As constraints limit the parameter space where hopping is possible, they must
    be tuned to each other in order to allow for hopping at all. Within the range
    of physiologically possible hopping frequencies, a human hopper selects a frequency
    where the largest amount of energy can be delivered and still be stored elastically.
    During running and hopping animals use flat angles of the landing velocity resulting
    in maximum contact length. In this situation ground reaction force is proportional
    to specific contact time and total displacement is proportional to the square
    of the step duration. Contact time and hopping frequency are not simply determined
    by the natural frequency of the spring-mass system, but are influenced largely
    by the vector of the landing velocity. Differences in the aerial phase or in the
    angle of the landing velocity result in the different kinematic and dynamic patterns
    observed during running and hopping. Despite these differences, the model predicts
    the mass specific energy fluctuations of the center of mass per distance to be
    similar for runners and hoppers and similar to empirical data obtained for animals
    of various size. 1989.

  abstract: In this chapter, I will first briefly review the history of engineering
    education to show the rise and fall then rise again of the making and building
    as curricular foci. I then discuss the theoretical underpinnings of project-based,
    student-centered, constructionist learning, showing that much of what digital
    fabrication labs can enact was already predicted and advocated in the theories
    and writings of John Dewey, Seymour Papert, and Paulo Freire. The following section
    approaches the educational benefits of digital fabrication and how it could be
    a unique tool in the hands of progressive educators. In the final part of the
    chapter I present not only four prototypical episodes that exemplify the advantages
    and perils of FabLabs in schools, but also some guidelines for the design of learning
    environments incorporating these types of technologies.

  issue: March
  abstract: 'Nonholonomic systems are, roughly speaking, me- chanical systems with
    constraints on their veloc- ity that are not derivable from position constraints.
    They arise, for instance, in mechanical systems that have rolling contact (for
    example, the rolling of wheels without slipping) or certain kinds of slid- ing
    contact (such as the sliding of skates). They are a remarkable generalization
    of classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems in which one allows po- sition
    constraints only. There are some fascinating differences between nonholonomic
    systems and classical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian systems. Among other things: non-
    holonomic systems are nonvariational—they arise from the Lagrange-d’Alembert principle
    and not from Hamilton’s principle; whereas energy is pre- served for nonholonomic
    systems, momentum is not always preserved for systems with symmetry (i.e., there
    is nontrivial dynamics associated with the nonholonomic generalization of Noether’s
    theorem); nonholonomic systems are almost Pois- son but not Poisson (i.e., there
    is a bracket that to- gether with the energy on the phase space defines the motion,
    but the bracket generally does not sat- isfy the Jacobi identity); and finally,
    unlike the Hamiltonian setting, volume may not be preserved in the phase space,
    leading to interesting asymp- totic stability in some cases, despite energy con-
    servation. The purpose of this article is to engage the reader’s interest by highlighting
    some of these differences along with some current research in the area. There
    has been some confusion in the liter- ature for quite some time over issues such
    as the variational character of nonholonomic systems, so it is appropriate that
    we begin with a brief review of the history of the subject.'

  container-title: Embodied Artificial Intelligence
  publisher: Springer
  page: 629-629
  abstract: Humanoid robots are fascinating from two points of view, firstly their
    construction and secondly because they lend life to inanimate objects. The combination
    of biology and robots leads to smoother and compliant movement which is more pleasant
    for us as people. Biologically inspired robots embody non-rigid movement which
    are made possible by special joints or actuators which give way and can both actively
    and passively adapt stiffness in different situations. The following paper deals
    with the construction of a compliant embodiment of a humanoid robot arm, including
    a five-finger hand with artificial fluidic muscles. The biologically inspired
    decentralized control architecture allows small units to be responsible for each
    main movement task. The first section gives a short introduction as to how bionics
    engineers think and tries to motivate us to build compliant machines. The second
    section looks at mechanical aspects, limitations and constraints and furthermore
    describes a human-like robot arm and hand. Section 3 presents the fluidic muscle
    actuator of the company FESTOThis project was supported by Dr. Werner Fischer
    and Univ. Prof. Axel Thallemer, FESTO AG & Co. KG.. The fourth section describes
    the decentralized control architecture and the electronic components. The last
    section concludes the paper while looking at further prospects.

  issue: '1931'
  abstract: '"The scansorial foot of the woodpeckers is not a zygodactyl foot,$\$nas
    commonly believed, but a quite different structure - the ectropodactyl$\$nfoot.
    With the exception of the most generalized members of the$\$nPicinae, which retain
    the ancestral zygodactyl foot as the climbing$\$nfoot, the toes of a climbing
    woodpecker are arranged as follows:$\$ntoes two and three point forward, the fourth
    toe is thrust out to$\$nthe lateral side at right angles to the fore toes, and
    the hallux$\$nusually lies beneath the distal end of the tarsometatarsus in a$\$ncramped
    position and is functionless. In the ivory-billed woodpecker,$\$nthe hallux is
    long and functional and is directed laterally next$\$nto the fourth toe. The fourth
    toe is either directed forward or$\$nthrust out to the side. In all the climbing
    woodpeckers, the fore$\$ntoes, together with the stiffened tail feathers which
    are propped$\$nagainst the tree trunk, serve to support the bird against the downward$\$nand
    inward component of gravity. The laterally directed fourth toes,$\$nand to a slight
    extent the fore toes, prevent the bird from being$\$npulled away from the trunk
    by the outward component of gravity.$\$nAny toe pointing down the tree trunk would
    be functionless. Lastly,$\$nthe evolution of the ectropodactyl foot from the zygodactyl
    foot$\$nis outlined. 2. The evolution of the perching- and climbing-foot$\$ntypes
    in birds is described. It is shown that the main requirement$\$nof a perching
    foot is a set of strong opposable toes. The anisodactyl,$\$nsyndactyl, heterodactyl,
    and zygodactyl arrangements of the toes$\$nfill the requirements of a perching
    foot. On the other hand, the$\$ntoes of a climbing foot must be arranged to oppose
    the pull of gravity$\$nand should bear strongly curved claws. The anisodactyl,
    syndactyl,$\$npamprodactyl, and ectropodactyl foot types comply with the functional$\$ndemands
    of a climbing foot. A dendrogram showing the foot types$\$nand their evolution
    is given. It is shown that each arrangement$\$nof the toes evolved in response
    to a particular function (i.e.,$\$nanisodactyl foot evolved for perching), but
    once evolved it was$\$nalso suitable for other functions (i.e., running or climbing).
    3.$\$nA brief discussion of the principle of multiple pathways of adaptation$\$nor
    evolution is presented. It is shown that there may be several$\$nmorphologically
    different answers to the same selection force and$\$nthat the morphological differences
    between these adaptive answers$\$nare not the result of differences in function
    but are a result of$\$nphylogenetically different starting points. Furthermore,
    it is shown$\$nthat one cannot conclude that different structures (i.e., arrangements$\$nof
    the toes) are non-adaptive just because their morphological differences$\$nare
    non-adaptive. Examples from the evolution of the perching- and$\$nclimbing-foot
    types were chosen to illustrate these conclusions"--P.$\$n42-43.'

  container-title: Second Conference of Junior Researchers in Civil Engineering
  page: 49-54
  abstract: In the present paper, we discuss the numeric integration techniques of
    the 9-node quadrilateral isoparametric Lagrangian Mindlin shell element. We present
    the concepts of full, reduced and selective integration schemes from two fundamental
    standpoints. The first being the well known inherent property of the displacement
    formulation of linear finite elements, notably the stiffening of the element (also
    known as shear-locking) when full integration of the stiffness matrix is used,
    while the second is concerned with reduced integration, where compensating for
    the previous problem by not accounting fully for certain higher order terms of
    the integrand the element becomes softer. In this latter case certain spurious
    zero energy displacement modes (ZEM) are possible to arise leading to unrealistic
    results, therefore it has to be handled by adding restrictive terms to the stiffness
    matrix. We conclude, that in case of the element under scrutiny, by selective
    integration (reduction at the bending shear terms) one ZEM occurs, which propagates
    through the whole mesh, while the full integration stiffens the element only by
    less than 6

  container-title: 7th Mediterranean Proceedings of Electrotechnical Conference
  page: 703-706
  abstract: The automation of the land excavation machines can find applications in
    the excavation of soil in both terrestrial and planetary mining and construction.
    The automation requires planning at different levels such as task and trajectory
    pre-planning, and the automatic execution of these pre-planned tasks. In the execution
    of the pre-planned digging trajectories, the unexpected soil properties along
    the trajectory rises problems such as excessive ram-forces that may harm the machine,
    or cannot be applied because of the power limitations. The cognitive force control
    for the automation of the land excavation is developed to include the dynamics
    of the excavator arm. The control of the ram forces of the arm is proposed by
    regulating the digging depth and the trajectory speed. The developed control system
    is able to track the pre-planned digging trajectories, and if the ram-forces becomes
    excessive then the trajectory is modified in time and path to control the ram-forces.

  abstract: 2016 ISAROBRobotic fish are nowadays developed for various types of research,
    such as bio-inspiredrobotics, biomimetics and animal behavior studies. In the
    context of our research on the social interactions of the zebrafish Danio Rerio,
    we developed a miniature robotic fish lure for direct underwater interaction with
    the living fish. This remotely controlled and waterproof device has a total length
    of 7.5 cm with the same size ratio as zebrafish and is able to beat its tail with
    different frequencies and amplitudes, while following the group of living animals
    using a mobile robot moving outside water that is coupled with the robotic lure
    using magnets. The robotic lure is also equipped with a rechargeable battery and
    can be used autonomously underwater for experiments of up to 1 h. We performed
    experiments with the robot moving inside an aquarium with living fish to analyze
    its impact on the zebrafish behavior. We found that the beating rate of the tail
    increased the attractiveness of the lure among the zebrafish shoal. We also demonstrated
    that the lure could influence a collective decision of the zebrafish shoal, the
    swimming direction, when moving with a constant linear speed inside a circular
    corridor. This new robotic fish design and the experimental results are promising
    for the field of fish–robot interaction.

    use in birds and primates.</span>'
  container-title: The Journal of experimental biology
  page: 1459-1463
  volume: '202'
  issue: Pt 11
  abstract: Many animals use thin perches, such as the branches of trees, as locomotory
    substrates. In this paper, I have reviewed the literature concerned with measurements
    of locomotory forces made by birds and primates on thin and flexible substrates.
    Through a knowledge of the locomotory forces exerted by animals when using different
    substrates, the mechanical cost of their use can be established. We are just beginning
    to learn about the magnitude and patterns of force production in various branch-using
    vertebrates, primarily as a result of the development of instrumented perches.
    Instrumented perches have been designed to measure the forces produced by birds
    and primates when leaping from rigid and flexible horizontal and flexible vertical
    perches, and also from instrumented handgrips during brachiation. The development
    of these techniques for birds and primates allows us to compare the way in which
    they use perches as locomotory substrates. In both birds and primates, the magnitudes
    of landing forces are smaller than those during take-off. Two explanations have
    been proposed; the difference is either a consequence of perch compliance or it
    is a strategic decision to be cautious of ’new’ perches. Leaps from flexible perches
    may be somewhat inefficient because considerable energy is dissipated in bending
    the perch, and this energy may remain unrecovered when the animal leaves contact
    with the perch.

  abstract: We describe the design of a force-transducing perch which measures the

    forces are lower than take-off forces, because the bird may decelerate prior to
    landing by using its wings. Both landing and take-off forces are significantly
    correlated with body mass; however, the angles of these reaction forces show no
    significant mass-dependence and are not repeatable within individuals. Diversity
    in take-off or landing strategy could be advantageous in confusing predators.

  issue: '22'
  abstract: Robots generally excel at specific tasks in structured environments but
    lack the versatility and the adaptability required to interact with and locomote
    within the natural world. To increase versatility in robot design, we present
    robotic skins that can wrap around arbitrary soft bodies to induce the desired
    motions and deformations. Robotic skins integrate actuation and sensing into a
    single conformable material and may be leveraged to create a multitude of controllable
    soft robots with different functions or gaits to accommodate the demands of different
    environments. We show that attaching the same robotic skin to a soft body in different
    ways, or to different soft bodies, leads to distinct motions. Further, we show
    that combining multiple robotic skins enables complex motions and functions. We
    demonstrate the versatility of this soft robot design approach in a wide range
    of applications—including manipulation tasks, locomotion, and wearables—using
    the same two-dimensional (2D) robotic skins reconfigured on the surface of various
    3D soft, inanimate objects.

  abstract: 'Despite decades of effort focused on improvement of engineering education,
    many recent advances have not resulted in systemic change. Diffusion of inno-
    vations theory is used to better understand this phenomenon. PURPOSE(HYPOTHESIS)
    Research questions include: How widespread is awareness and adoption of established
    engineering education innovations? Are there differences by discipline or institutional
    type? How do engineering department chairs find out about engineering education
    innovations? What factors do engineering department chairs cite as important in
    adoption decisions? DESIGN/METHOD U.S. engineering department chairs were surveyed
    regarding their awareness and department use of seven engineering education innovations.
    One hun- dred ninety-seven usable responses are presented primarily as categorical
    data with Chi square tests where relevant. active pedagogies (the highest). Mechanical
    and civil engineering had the highest rates, in part due to many design-related
    innovations in the survey. Few differences by institution type were evident. In
    the past, word of mouth and presentations were far more effective than publications
    in alerting depart- ment chairs to the innovations. Department chairs cited financial
    resources, faculty time and attitudes, and student satisfaction and learning as
    major con- siderations in adoption decisions. CONCLUSIONS The importance of disciplinary
    networks was evident during survey adminis- tration and in the results. Specific
    recommendations are offered to employ these networks and the engineering professional
    societies for future engineer- ing education improvement efforts. RESULTS Overall,

  abstract: The ’Embedded Projection Method’ (EPM) is an attempt to eliminate most
    of the difficulties related to the solution of high-index differential-algebraic
    equations (DAEs), as those typical of the dynamics of constrained systems. The
    intimate coupling between the algebraic and the differential parts lies at the
    origin of these difficulties, therefore we uncouple these components, introduce
    an unconstrained, modified state variable, and complement the resulting ordinary
    differential equation (ODE) by additional algebraic variables. As a result, a
    general, consistent index reduction from arbitrarily high values to one is obtained,
    allowing the use of any suitable ODE integration algorithm, without the need for
    a specialized DAE solver. The EPM solution is intrinsically endowed with greater
    accuracy and stability than conventional counterparts, thus balancing the higher
    complexity of the procedure. We illustrate the EPM including some applications
    of holonomic and non-holonomic mechanical systems. 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  abstract: The key task performed by CNCs is the generation of the time-sequence
    of set-points for driving each physical axis of the machine tool during program
    execution. This interpolation of axes movement must satisfy a number of constraints
    on axes dynamics (velocity, acceleration, and jerk), and on process outcome (smooth
    tool movement and precise tracking of the nominal tool-path at the desired feed-rate).
    This paper presents an algorithm for CNC kernels that aims at solving the axes
    interpolation problem by exploiting an Optimal Control Problem formulation. With
    respect to other solutions proposed in the literature, the approach presented
    here takes an original approach by assuming a predefined path tracking tolerance
    - to be added to the constraints listed above - and calculating the whole trajectory
    (path and feed-rate profile) that satisfies the given constraints. The effectiveness
    of the proposed solution is benchmarked against the trajectory generated by an
    industrial, state-of-the-art CNC, proving a significant advantage in efficiency
    and smoothness of axes velocity profiles. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

    of total energy cost. Also, the hardware components and their interconnections

  abstract: Identifying effective tutorial dialogue strategies is a key issue for
    intelligent tutoring systems research. Human-human tutoring offers a valuable
    model for identifying effective tutorial strategies, but extracting them is a
    challenge because of the richness of human dialogue. This article addresses that
    challenge through a machine learning approach that 1) learns tutorial modes from
    a corpus of human tutoring, and 2) identifies the statistical relationships between
    student outcomes and the learned modes. The modeling approach utilizes hidden
    Markov models (HMMs) to capture the unobservable stochastic structure that is
    thought to influence the observations, in this case dialogue acts and task actions,
    that are generated by task-oriented tutorial dialogue. We refer to this unobservable
    layer as the hidden dialogue state, and interpret it as representing the tutor
    and students’ collaborative intentions. We have applied HMMs to a corpus of annotated
    task-oriented tutorial dialogue to learn one model for each of two effective human
    tutors. Significant correlations emerged between the automatically extracted tutoring
    modes and student learning outcomes. Broadly, the results suggest that HMMs can
    learn meaningful hidden tutorial dialogue structure. More specifically, the findings
    point to specific mechanisms within task-oriented tutorial dialogue that are associated
    with increased student learning. This work has direct applications in authoring
    data-driven tutorial dialogue system behavior and in investigating the effectiveness
    of human tutoring. 2011 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Biological systems consistently outperform autonomous systems governed
    by engineered algorithms in their ability to reactively avoid collisions. To better
    understand this discrepancy, a collision avoidance algorithm was applied to frames
    of digitized video trajectory data from bats, swallows and fish (Myotis velifer,
    Petrochelidon pyrrhonota and Danio aequipinnatus). Information available from
    visual cues, specifically relative position and velocity, was provided to the
    algorithm which used this information to define collision cones that allowed the
    algorithm to find a safe velocity requiring minimal deviation from the original
    velocity. The subset of obstacles provided to the algorithm was determined by
    the animal’s sensing range in terms of metric and topological distance. The algorithmic
    calculated velocities showed good agreement with observed biological velocities,
    indicating that the algorithm was an informative basis for comparison with the
    three species and could potentially be improved for engineered applications with
    further study.

  abstract: By means of the Udwadia-Kalaba approach we propose an explicit equation
    of constrained motion developed to simulate constrained dynamical systems without
    error accumulation due to constraint drift. The basic idea is to embed a small
    virtual force and a small virtual impulse to the equation of motion, in order
    to avoid the drift typically experienced in constrained multibody simulations.
    The embedded correction terms are selected to minimally alter the dynamics in
    an acceleration and kinetic energy norm sense. The formulation allows one to use
    a standard ODE solver, avoiding the need for iterative constraint stabilization.
    The equation is based on the pseudoinverse of a constraint matrix such that it
    can be used under redundant constraints and kinematic singularities. The proposed
    method takes into account the finite word-length of the computational environment,
    and also accommodates possibly inconsistent initial conditions. ?? 2009 Elsevier

    Chapter V concludes the work with the contributions and the proposed future direction.
    An overview of the manuscripts presented through Chapter II-IV is given as follows:
    Manuscript 1: D.J. Braun and M. Goldfarb, "Eliminating Constraint Drift in the

    provide a theoretical framework for numerical simulation of constrained dynamical
    system modeled with differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Specifically, the
    paper offers an equation of constrained motion which, solved with a standard explicit
    ODE integrator (i.e., Euler, Runge-Kutta method), provides a precise motion prediction
    for DAEs. Beyond the theoretical contribution, the paper presents three trajectory
    tracking simulations on a seven link planar anthropometric biped robot which demonstrates
    feasibility of the approach to simulate bipedal motion subjected to redundant
    (dependent) constraints. This features have been recognized important through
    numerical investigation of the walking controller proposed in \[25\] (Manuscript
    2). The real-time implementation of the method was also utilized for parameter
    identification, free swing experiments, and the PD control experiment performed
    to characterize the dynamics of the seven link biped, design and control of which
    is discussed in \[26\] (Manuscript 3). Manuscript 2: D.J. Braun and M. Goldfarb,
    "A Control Approach to Actuated Dynamic Walking in Biped Robots," IEEE Transaction
    on Robotics , 2009 - accepted. A short version of this paper, \[27\], is presented
    at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, October
    11-15, 2009, St. Louis, USA. This article presents a control framework for human-like
    actuated dynamic walking in biped robots. Instead of utilizing the ZMP (zero-moment-point)
    control philosophy (frequently preferred to synthesize actuated dynamic walking),
    we propose an alternative control method for human-like dynamic walking. The proposed
    approach meant to improve, the walking style (bent knee walking) and the low locomotion
    efficiency recognized as fundamental issues in the majority of actuated walking
    robots. As was recognized during the conducted research, realization of a compliant
    walking precludes enforcement of a prespecified reference trajectory, or may also
    not favor enforcing state dependent kinematic constraints or other attributes
    of the walking cycle (such as step length, stepping frequency or average forward
    speed) with high gain control. This recognition motivated us to develop a control
    framework which utilizes state-dependent control torques generated by low-gain
    spring-damper couples to provide motion coordination without prespecifying the
    motion of the system. As is demonstrated (through numerous simulations) in the
    article, the approach can provide energy-efficient human like actuated dynamic
    walking in biped robots. Manuscript 3: D.J. Braun, Jason E. Mitchell and M. Goldfarb,
    "Experimental Implementation of Actuated Dynamic Walking in Biped Robots," The
    International Journal of Robotics Research - submitted. A short version of this
    paper, \[2\], is accepted on the 9th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid
    Robots December 7-10, 2009, Paris, France. By utilizing the control framework
    proposed in \[25\] (Manuscript 2), this article presents an experimental realization
    of actuated dynamic walking in biped robots. During the development of the walking
    controller, an important design requirement for energy-efficient realization of
    dynamic walking have been identified. This requirement depends on joint actuation
    which should not suppress the passive joint motion (i.e., joints should be backdrivable
    such as human joints . Practically, utilization of backdrivable joint design allows
    the inertial motion of the robot to be exploited through walking rather than being
    suppressed by the actuation units. This recognition motivated us to design a seven
    link biped robot, with highly backdrivable joints, which device is used in the
    experimental verification of the control framework. The presented walking experiment
    demonstrates dynamic walking characterized with (partially) ballistic swing, extended
    knee stance support and (preemptive) ankle push-off which feature can also be
    identified during (fast) human walking. Utilizing the framework presented in \[28\],
    a control approach for human-like actuated dynamic walking was analytically developed

    Butterfly Inachis io L. (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) and some Aspects of Insect
    Flight Evolution</span>
  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 77-95
  volume: '161'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'High-speed filming has been used to investigate the performance of the
    peacock butterfly Inachis io while flying in a wind-tunnel. The wake of the butterfly
    in ’feeding’ flight is a system of discrete pairs of vortex rings: in each pair
    the vortex rings are coupled at right angles. The flow distribution around the
    butterfly and the dynamics of the vortex rings suggest that useful force is produced
    continuously throughout the wingbeat. The butterfly’s flapping flight can be divided
    into three successive stages: during the downstroke, force generation can be explained
    by quasi-steady aerofoil action; during the upstroke and supination, by unsteady
    aerofoil action; and during pronation, by a jet mechanism. The study of airflow
    around the peacock butterfly throws light on the evolutionary changes in the pattern
    of interaction between insect wings and the air. At the first stage of the evolution
    of insect flight, documented in a subimago of the mayfly Heptagenia sulphurea
    and some other primitive insects, flapping wings generate a system of coupled
    vortex rings; the aerodynamic force, being perpendicular to the stroke plane,
    coincides with the direction of the longitudinal body axis. At the second stage,
    this force is directed forwards and upwards relative to the body axis; the vortex
    wake is the same as that at the first stage. From this point, two paths of evolution
    are possible. The first leads to the vortex pattern recorded in the peacock butterfly.
    The second is typically found in higher orders, where the narrow and relatively
    short wings flap with lower amplitude and higher frequency, leaving in their wake
    two chains of uncoupled small vortex rings.'

    lumped approach, (energy)-port based models. The 9 basic bond graph elements are
    presented. Systematic procedures are presented to construct a bond graph and to
    analyse it, to generate equations, to generate block diagrams. Furthermore, analysis
    can be done on graph level, i.e. without the often tedious and error-prone work
    of generation of differential equations. Note that the essential analysis techniques
    on graph level and the generation of equations are automated for which several
    software packages are available (we use 20-SIM) Advice on efficient simulation
    of bond graph models is presented. At last, information on further reading is

    The proposed method allows for an arbitrary number of mate-rials, produces high-quality
    tetrahedral meshes with upper and lower bounds on dihedral angles, and guarantees
    geometric fidelity. Moreover, the method is combinatoric so its implementation
    enables rapid mesh construction. These meshes are structured in a way that also
    allows grading, in order to reduce element counts in regions of homogeneity.

  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: 18809-18814
  volume: '107'
  issue: '44'
  abstract: Gripping and holding of objects are key tasks for robotic manipulators.
    The development of universal grippers able to pick up unfamiliar objects of widely
    varying shape and surface properties remains, however, challenging. Most current
    designs are based on the multi-fingered hand, but this approach introduces hardware
    and software complexities. These include large numbers of controllable joints,
    the need for force sensing if objects are to be handled securely without crushing
    them, and the computational overhead to decide how much stress each finger should
    apply and where. Here we demonstrate a completely different approach to a universal
    gripper. Individual fingers are replaced by a single mass of granular material
    that, when pressed onto a target object, flows around it and conforms to its shape.
    Upon application of a vacuum the granular material contracts and hardens quickly
    to pinch and hold the object without requiring sensory feedback. We find that
    volume changes of less than 0.5

  container-title: The International Journal of Robotics Research
  page: 820-833
  volume: '30'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: One of the hallmarks of the performance, versatility, and robustness of
    biological motor control is the ability to adapt the impedance of the overall
    biomechanical system to different task requirements and stochastic disturbances.
    A transfer of this principle to robotics is desirable, for instance to enable
    robots towork robustly and safely in everyday human environments. It is, however,
    not trivial to derive variable impedance controllers for practical high degree-of-freedom
    (DOF) robotic tasks. In this contribution, we accomplish such variable impedance
    control with the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm PI2 (Policy Improvement
    with Path Integrals). PI2 is a model-free, sampling-based learning method derived
    from first principles of stochastic optimal control. The PI2 algorithm requires
    no tuning of algorithmic parameters besides the exploration noise. The designer
    can thus fully focus on the cost function design to specify the task. From the
    viewpoint of robotics, a particular useful property of PI2 is that it can scale
    to problems of many DOFs, so that reinforcement learning on real robotic systems
    becomes feasible. We sketch the PI2 algorithm and its theoretical properties,
    and how it is applied to gain scheduling for variable impedance control. We evaluate
    our approach by presenting results on several simulated and real robots. We consider
    tasks involving accurate tracking through via points, and manipulation tasks requiring
    physical contact with the environment. In these tasks, the optimal strategy requires
    both tuning of a reference trajectory and the impedance of the end-effector. The
    results show that we can use path integral based reinforcement learning not only
    for planning but also to derive variable gain feedback controllers in realistic
    scenarios. Thus, the power of variable impedance control is made available to
    a wide variety of robotic systems and practical applications

  abstract: Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, while superior to medical therapy
    alone, carries significant risk of complications and limited efficacy. Surgical
    therapy for atrial fibrillation, including the maze procedure, seems to be more
    effective but is also more invasive than percutaneous approaches. In this review,
    we outline the rationale for a percutaneous catheter-based epicardial ablation
    strategy. Operators considering such a procedure should have a detailed understanding
    of the anatomy of the preicardial space, which is reviewed in this manuscript.
    Also, technology used in epicardial ablation and special challenges of epicardial
    ablation are discussed. Finally, some preliminary work on epicardial ablation
    of atrial fibrillation is reviewed before concluding with some possibilities for
    future research in the area.

  abstract: To test whether mole-rats Cryptomys hottentotus were able to use the magnetic
    field for orientation, laboratory experiments were conducted which were based
    on the animals’ spontaneous tendency to build their nests at the same position
    in a circular arena. In the local geomagnetic field, the animals preferred the
    SE-sector. When magnetic north was turned by 120 $\sim$ or by 180 $\sim$ the mole-rats
    changed their nest position accordingly. This clearly shows that they can use
    the magnetic field for direction finding.

    frictional conditions during multidigit manipulation.</span>
  container-title: Journal of neurophysiology
  page: 2393-405
  volume: '82'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Control of grasp stability under different frictional conditions has primarily
    been studied in manipulatory tasks involving two digits only. Recently we found
    that many of the principles for control of forces originally demonstrated for
    two-digit grasping also apply to various three-digit grasps. Here we examine the
    control of grasp stability in a multidigit task in which subjects used the tips
    of the thumb, index, and middle finger to lift an object. The grasp resembled
    those used when lifting a cylindrical object from above. The digits either all
    contacted the same surface material or one of the digits contacted a surface material
    that was more, or less, slippery than that contacted by the other two digits.
    The three-dimensional forces and torques applied by each digit and the contact
    positions were measured along with the position and orientation of the object.
    The distribution of forces among the digits strongly reflected constraints imposed
    by the geometric relationship between the object’s center of mass and the contact
    surfaces. On top of this distribution, we observed changes in force coordination
    related to changes in the combination of surface materials. When all digits contacted
    the same surface material, the ratio between the normal force and tangential load
    (F(n):L ratio) was similar across digits and scaled to provide an adequate safety
    margin against slip. With different contact surfaces subjects adapted the F(n):L
    ratios at the individual digits to the local friction with only small influences
    by the friction at the other two digits. They accomplished this by scaling the
    normal forces similarly at all digits and changing the distribution of load among
    the digits. The surface combination did not, however, influence digit position,
    tangential torque, or object tilting systematically. The change in load distribution,
    rather, resulted from interplay between these factors, and the nature of this
    interplay varied between trials. That is, subjects achieved grasp stability with
    various combinations of fingertip actions and appeared to exploit the many degrees
    of freedom offered by the multidigit grasp. The results extend previous findings
    based on two-digit tasks to multidigit tasks by showing that subjects adjust fingertip
    forces at each digit to the local friction. Moreover, our findings suggest that
    subjects adapted the load distribution to the current frictional condition by
    regulating the normal forces to allow slips to occur early in the lift task, prior
    to object lift-off.

  abstract: The main features of DLR’s dextrous robot hand as a modular component
    of a complete robotics system are outlined in this paper. The application of robotics
    systems in unstructured servicing environments requires dextrous manipulation
    abilities and facilities to perform complex remote operations in a very flexible
    way. Therefore we have developed a multisensory articulated four finger hand,
    where all actuators are integrated in the hand’s palm or the fingers directly.
    It is an integrated part of a complex light-weight manipulation system aiming
    at the development of robonauts for space. After a brief description of the hand
    and it’s sensorial equipment the hard- and software architecture is outlined with
    particular emphasis on flexibility and performance issues. The hand is typically
    controlled through a data glove for telemanipulation and skill-transfer purposes.
    Autonomous grasping and manipulation capabilities are currently under development

  container-title: Proceedings. Biological sciences / The Royal Society
  page: 1007-1013
  volume: '275'
  issue: '1638'
  abstract: Arboreal animals negotiate a highly three-dimensional world that is discontinuous
    on many spatial scales. As the scale of substrate discontinuity increases, many
    arboreal animals rely on leaping or gliding locomotion between distant supports.
    In order to successfully move through their habitat, gliding animals must actively
    modulate both propulsive and aerodynamic forces. Here we examined the take-off
    and landing kinetics of a free-ranging gliding mammal, the Malayan colugo (Galeopterus
    variegatus) using a custom-designed three-dimensional accelerometry system. We
    found that colugos increase the propulsive impulse to affect longer glides. However,
    we also found that landing forces are negatively associated with glide distance.
    Landing forces decrease rapidly as glide distance increases from the shortest
    glides, then level off, suggesting that the ability to reorient the aerodynamic
    forces prior to landing is an important mechanism to reduce velocity and thus
    landing forces. This ability to substantially alter the aerodynamic forces acting
    on the patagial wing in order to reorient the body is a key to the transition
    between leaping and gliding and allows gliding mammals to travel long distances
    between trees with reduced risk of injury. Longer glides may increase the access
    to distributed resources and reduce the exposure to predators in the canopy or
    on the forest floor.

  page: 23-34
  volume: 8608 LNAI
  abstract: For their efficient and elegant locomotion, batoid fishes (e.g. the manta
    ray) have been widely studied in biology, and also taken as a source of inspiration
    by engineers and roboticists willing to replicate their propulsion mechanism in
    order to build efficient swimming machines. In this work, a new model of an under-actuated
    compliant wing is proposed, exhibiting both the oscillatory and undulatory behaviors
    underlying batoid propulsion mechanism. The proposed model allowed an investigation
    of the co-evolution of morphology and control, exploiting dynamics emergent from
    the interaction between the environment and the mechanical properties of the soft
    materials. Having condensed such aspects in a mathematical model, we studied the
    adaptability of a batoid-like morphology to different environments. As for biology,
    our main contribution is an exploration of the parameters linking swimming mechanics,
    morphology and environment. This can contribute to a deeper understanding of the
    factors that led various species of the batoid group to phylogenetically adapt
    to different environments. From a robotics standpoint, this work offers an additional
    example remarking the importance of morphological computation and embodied intelligence.
    A direct application can be an under-water soft robot capable of adapting morphology
    and control to reach the maximum swimming efficiency. &copy; 2014 Springer International

  title: <span class="nocase">Advanced Parallel Actuation of a Serial Robotic Leg</span>
  page: V05AT07A056
  abstract: 'Advanced actuation methods are needed in legged robots in order to build
    robust and efficient robotic systems. State of the art robots either consume much
    more energy than their biological counterparts or are dramatically less mobile.
    Advanced actuation methods are necessary to achieve both efficiency and mobility.
    Many highly mobile legged robots are actuated in serial, but serial actuation
    has many known weaknesses. This research explores a new and promising method of
    actuation that is a hybrid of serial and parallel actuation. This method is able
    to draw from the large body of research conducted on parallel manipulators over
    the last several decades. This research has shown that parallel manipulators can
    offer many advantages over serial arms including: smaller mobile mass, more rigidity,
    faster end effector speeds, and large force capacity. All of these advantages
    are well suited for the requirements of legged robots. In this paper, the authors
    detail the implementation of this advanced actuation method from conceptualization
    to the first stages of testing. It details the choice of configuration, which
    was important, and somewhat counter intuitive. It also walks through the kinematic
    solutions, showing relatively simple solutions to challenging problems. The goal
    of the work is to use multiple, small motors in parallel to actuate the hip and
    the knee. In this way, during the stance phase of gait, multiple motors can be
    used in parallel to provide a powerful burst for push-off. Our two-link parallel
    structure allows the motors to cross multiple joints and therefore can be used
    to actuate several joints at once. In addition, by mounting motors at the base,
    the inertia of the leg is greatly reduced. Matthew Holgate SpringActive Inc. Tempe,
    Arizona, USA Thomas G. Sugar Arizona State University Tempe, Arizona, USA Creating
    a fast, efficient leg structure is the first step in our project. The higher level
    goal of this research is to create a quadruped robot that is designed for efficient
    and fast running. The novel leg structure described in this paper will be capable
    of the types of motions associated with high speed gait. The robot needs to be
    capable of both high speed motions and high force output, without being excessively
    heavy. It should also be capable of accurate three dimensional control, and meet
    certain manipulability criterion. In this paper we show a functional and promising
    3D printed leg prototype. This paper will provide a detailed description of this
    unique approach to actuation. It will also show the solution to the kinematic
    equations. Finally, as a proof of concept, the leg was moved in a gait pattern
    over a treadmill.'

  abstract: Maxwell has shown that b bars assembled into a frame having j joints would,
    in general, be simply stiff if b = 3j-6. Some of Buckminster Fuller’s "Tensegrity"
    structures have fewer bars than are necessary to satisfy Maxwell’s rule, and yet
    are not "mechanisms" as one might expect, but are actually stiff structures. Maxwell
    anticipates special cases of this sort, and states that their stiffness will "be
    of a low order". In fact, the conditions under which Maxwell’s exceptional cases
    occur also permit at least one state of "self-stress" in the frame. Linear algebra
    enables us to find the number of "incipient" modes of low-order stiffness of the
    frame in terms of the numbers of bars, joints and independent states of self-stress.
    Self-stress in the frame has the effect of imparting first-order stiffness to
    the frame, and it seems from experiments that a single state of self-stress can
    stiffen a large number of modes. It is this factor which Fuller exploits to make
    satisfactory structures. 1978.

  volume: '21'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Transforming flat sheets into three-dimensional structures has emerged
    as an exciting manufacturing paradigm on a broad range of length scales. Among
    other advantages, this technique permits the use of functionality-inducing planar
    processes on flat starting materials, which after shape-shifting, result in a
    unique combination of macro-scale geometry and surface topography. Fabricating
    arbitrarily complex three-dimensional geometries requires the ability to change
    the intrinsic curvature of initially flat structures, while simultaneously limiting
    material distortion to not disturb the surface features. The centuries-old art
    forms of origami and kirigami could offer elegant solutions, involving only folding
    and cutting to transform flat papers into complex geometries. Although such techniques
    are limited by an inherent developability constraint, the rational design of the
    crease and cut patterns enables the shape-shifting of (nearly) inextensible sheets
    into geometries with apparent intrinsic curvature. Here, we review recent origami
    and kirigami techniques that can be used for this purpose, discuss their underlying
    mechanisms, and create physical models to demonstrate and compare their feasibility.
    Moreover, we highlight practical aspects that are relevant in the development
    of advanced materials with these techniques. Finally, we provide an outlook on
    future applications that could benefit from origami and kirigami to create intrinsically
    curved surfaces.

  abstract: Recent research demonstrates the importance of prototyping to support
    early stage design efforts. There remains a substantial opportunity to provide
    tools that codify the leap between the logical objectives of the design effort,
    and an individual’s intuitive design and fabrication experience. This study investigates
    project articles on the open source, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) design repository, Instructables.com.
    The database contains guides for producing low cost functional prototypes. Many
    entries in the repository include documentation of the design process along with
    instructions for fabrication. Through a systematic research methodology, we extract
    five prototype design and fabrication principles from articles in the database.
    An online crowdsourced assessment enables inter-rater testing, with multiple parallel
    raters. This assessment validates presence of the principles in the database.
    A controlled study was conducted in which one of two groups was exposed to the
    principles. This study evaluates connectivity, successful adoption of the principles
    by participants in the experimental group, and resulting design performance effects.
    Two case studies of prototyping are also provided. Observations indicate that
    application of the principles positively impacts prototyping outcomes. A potential
    area for improvement is edge case evaluation, i.e. principles only found in a

    Tasks</span>
  abstract: Human-robot interaction benefits greatly from multimodal sensor inputs
    as they enable increased robustness and generalization accuracy. Despite this
    observation, few HRI methods are capable of efficiently performing inference for
    multimodal systems. In this work, we introduce a reformulation of Interaction
    Primitives which allows for learning from demonstration of interaction tasks,
    while also gracefully handling nonlinearities inherent to multimodal inference
    in such scenarios. We also empirically show that our method results in more accurate,
    more robust, and faster inference than standard Interaction Primitives and other
    common methods in challenging HRI scenarios.

  abstract: 'This report grew out of a workshop sponsored by the National Science
    Foundation (NSF) in Arlington, Virginia, on April 17-18, 2008. The two-day workshop,
    attended by approximately 60 participants, sought to develop and validate a strategy
    by which to assess the value of NSF’s investment in broadening participation across
    all directorates and programs. Invited participants represented the following
    constituencies: NSF grantees, professional evaluators, and the policy community
    (which included representatives from Congress, the Office of Management and Budget
    \[OMB\], NSF staff, and staff from other federal agencies). Many of the workshop
    participants and other invited guests reconvened in December 2008 to hear about
    and discuss the progress being made in developing a report based on the April
    workshop. The December half-day meeting offered an opportunity to refine the ideas
    laid out by the authors engaged in developing the final document.'

  volume: '3'
  abstract: This paper presents the fabrication and the testing of piezoelectric unimorph
    actuators with embedded piezoelectric sensors which are meant to be used for the
    actuation of the Micromechanical Flying Insect (MFI). First the fabrication process
    of a piezoelectric bending actuator comprising a standard unimorph and a rigid
    extension is described together with the advantages of adding such an extension.
    Then the convenience of obtaining an embedded piezoelectric sensor by a simple
    and inexpensive variation of the fabrication process is pointed out. A model for
    the sensor embedded into a unimorph actuator with rigid extension is derived together
    with its flat response band limits. Calibration steps are also outlined which
    allow, despite residual parasitic actuator-sensor coupling, the use of the actuator
    with the embedded sensor for measuring position and inertial forces when external
    mechanical structures are driven. An experiment is carried out which validates
    the model for the actuator/sensor device under desired operating conditions. Preliminary
    application of the fabricated device to the MFI is also presented where the mechanical
    power fed into the wing is estimated.

  abstract: A method to find optimal topology and shape of structures is presented.
    With the first the optimal distribution of an assigned mass is found using an
    approach based on homogenisation theory, that seeks in which elements of a meshed
    domain it is present mass; with the second the discontinuous boundaries are smoothed.
    The problem of the optimal topology search has an ON/OFF nature and has suggested
    the employment of genetic algorithms. Thus in this paper a genetic algorithm has
    been developed, which uses as design variables, in the topology optimisation,
    the relative densities (with respect to effective material density) 0 or 1 of
    each element of the structure and, in the shape one, the coordinates of the keypoints
    of changeable boundaries constituted by curves. In both the steps the aim is that
    to find the variable sets producing the maximum stiffness of the structure, respecting
    an upper limit on the employed mass. The structural evaluations are carried out
    with a FEM commercial code, linked to the algorithm. Some applications have been
    performed and results compared with solutions reported in literature. ?? 2003

  page: 193-208
  volume: '1'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Reaching and grasping in primates depend on the coordination of neural
    activity in large frontoparietal ensembles. Here we demonstrate that primates
    can learn to reach and grasp virtual objects by controlling a robot arm through
    a closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMIc) that uses multiple mathematical models
    to extract several motor parameters (i.e., hand position, velocity, gripping force,
    and the EMGs of multiple arm muscles) from the electrical activity of frontoparietal
    neuronal ensembles. As single neurons typically contribute to the encoding of
    several motor parameters, we observed that high BMIc accuracy required recording
    from large neuronal ensembles. Continuous BMIc operation by monkeys led to significant
    improvements in both model predictions and behavioral performance. Using visual
    feedback, monkeys succeeded in producing robot reach-and-grasp movements even
    when their arms did not move. Learning to operate the BMIc was paralleled by functional
    reorganization in multiple cortical areas, suggesting that the dynamic properties
    of the BMIc were incorporated into motor and sensory cortical representations.

  abstract: The objective of the project described in this paper is the development
    of a cybernetic prosthesis, replicating as much as possible the sensory-motor
    capabilities of the natural hand. The human hand is not only an effective tool
    but also an ideal instrument to acquire information from the external environment.
    The development of a truly human-like artificial hand is probably the most widely
    known paradigm of "bionics". The Cyberhand Project aims to obtain a cybernetic
    prosthetic hand interfaced to the peripheral nervous system. In particular this
    paper is focused on the hand mechanisms design and it presents preliminary results
    in developing the three fingered anthropomorphic hand prototype and its sensory
    system.

  abstract: Commercially available prosthetic hands are simple grippers with one or
    two degrees of freedom; these pinch type devices have two rigid fingers in opposition
    to a rigid thumb. This paper focuses on an innovative approach for the design
    of a myoelectric prosthetic hand. The new prosthesis features underactuated mechanisms
    in order to achieve a natural grasping behavior and a good distribution of pinching
    forces. In this paper it is shown that underactuation allows reproducing most
    of the grasping behaviors of the human hand, without augmenting the mechanical
    and control complexity.

  abstract: 'Abstract Strong motivation for developing new prosthetic hand devices
    is provided by the fact that low functionality and controllability—in addition
    to poor cosmetic appearance—are the most important reasons why amputees do not
    regularly use their prosthetic hands. This paper presents the design of the CyberHand,
    a cybernetic anthropomorphic hand intended to provide amputees with functional
    hand replacement. Its design was bio-inspired in terms of its modular architecture,
    its physical appearance, kinematics, sensorization, and actuation, and its multilevel
    control system. Its underactuated mechanisms allow separate control of each digit
    as well as thumb–finger opposition and, accordingly, can generate a multitude
    of grasps. Its sensory system was designed to provide proprioceptive information
    as well as to emulate fundamental functional properties of human tactile mechanoreceptors
    of specific importance for grasp-and-hold tasks. The CyberHand control system
    presumes just a few efferent and afferent channels and was divided in two main
    layers: a high-level control that interprets the user’s intention (grasp selection
    and required force level) and can provide pertinent sensory feedback and a low-level
    control responsible for actuating specific grasps and applying the desired total
    force by taking advantage of the intelligent mechanics. The grasps made available
    by the high-level controller include those fundamental for activities of daily
    living: cylindrical, spherical, tridigital (tripod), and lateral grasps. The modular
    and flexible design of the CyberHand makes it suitable for incremental development
    of sensorization, interfacing, and control strategies and, as such, it will be
    a useful tool not only for clinical research but also for addressing neuroscientific
    hypotheses regarding sensorimotor control.'

    legged robot</span>
  container-title: 2013 ieee international conference on robotics and automation
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 5469-5474
  abstract: Miniature legged robots have demonstrated fast locomotion at small sizes,
    but underactuation generally limits their performance in rapid turns and other
    dynamic maneuvers. In this work, the inertial effect of swinging a dynamic tail
    was studied as a method to achieve these rapid turns. An analytic model of a robot
    with a reaction wheel tail was developed to determine the effect of varying system
    parameters such as tail motor voltage, coefficient of friction, and tail inertia
    on inertial turning performance. This model was also validated experimentally
    using a modified off-the-shelf miniature legged robot. The same trends seen in
    the analytic study were also found in the experiments varying motor voltage, coefficient
    of friction, and tail inertia.

  title: <span class="nocase">The determinants of the step frequency in running, trotting
    and hopping in man and other vertebrates.</span>
  container-title: The Journal of Physiology
  page: 81-92
  volume: '399'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: '1\. During each step of running, trotting or hopping part of the gravitational
    and kinetic energy of the body is absorbed and successively restored by the muscles
    as in an elastic rebound. In this study we analysed the vertical motion of the
    centre of gravity of the body during this rebound and defined the relationship
    between the apparent natural frequency of the bouncing system and the step frequency
    at the different speeds. 2. The step period and the vertical oscillation of the
    centre of gravity during the step were divided into two parts: a part taking place
    when the vertical force exerted on the ground is greater than body weight (lower
    part of the oscillation) and a part taking place when this force is smaller than
    body weight (upper part of the oscillation). This analysis was made on running
    humans and birds; trotting dogs, monkeys and rams; and hopping kangaroos and springhares.
    3. During trotting and low-speed running the rebound is symmetric, i.e. the duration
    and the amplitude of the lower part of the vertical oscillation of the centre
    of gravity are about equal to those of the upper part. In this case, the step
    frequency equals the frequency of the bouncing system. 4. At high speeds of running
    and in hopping the rebound is asymmetric, i.e. the duration and the amplitude
    of the upper part of the oscillation are greater than those of the lower part,
    and the step frequency is lower than the frequency of the system. 5. The asymmetry
    is due to a relative increase in the vertical push. At a given speed, the asymmetric
    bounce requires a greater power to maintain the motion of the centre of gravity
    of the body, Wext, than the symmetric bounce. A reduction of the push would decrease
    Wext but the resulting greater step frequency would increase the power required
    to accelerate the limbs relative to the centre of gravity, Wint. It is concluded
    that the asymmetric rebound is adopted in order to minimize the total power, Wext
    + Wint.'

    at higher speeds Wf greather than Wv: in both cases Wext/km increases. 3. The

    the forward speed changes (variation of kinetic energy) and to the vertical displacement
    of the center of gravity (variation of potential energy), throughout the step
    cycle, are substantially in phase. The external work performed per kilometer is
    independent of speed, amounting to 0.25 kcal/kg km. The total mechanical work
    amounts to about 0.40–0.50 kcal/kg km. The efficiency in running has been calculated
    as about 40–50

    with feet is derived including the effects of impact of the feet with the ground.
    Motions of the hip and feet during a regular step are then modelled by 3rd order
    polynomials, the coefficients of which are obtained by numerically minimising
    an energy cost function. Results are given in the form of walking profiles and
    energy curves for the specific cases of motion over level ground, motion up and
    down an incline, and varying payload.

  abstract: 'Four aspects of the functioning of a fluid-filled cylindrical animal
    have been examined, viz.: (I) the role of the body fluid as a skeleton for the
    interaction of the longitudinal and circular muscles of which the animal must
    be composed; (2) the measurement of the maximum thrust which the animal can exert
    by measurement of its internal hydrostatic pressure; (3) the application of the
    force to the substratum and the part played by friction; (4) the relation between
    the changes in dimensions of the animal and the working length of the muscles.Under
    (1) the necessity for a longitudinal and circular construction has been shown
    and the necessity for a closed system emphasized.Under (2) the pressure exerted
    on the body fluid by the contraction of the longitudinal and circular muscles
    is discussed, and from their cross-sectional areas it is shown to be probable
    that when contracting maximally in Lumbricus they are not balanced, but that the
    longitudinals are about ten times as strong as the circulars.Under (3) it is shown
    that the strength of an animal as measured by its internal hydrostatic pressure
    is sufficient to account for its customary activities. Use which may be made of
    the longitudinals during burrowing is pointed out.Under (4) it is shown to be
    mechanically sound for burrowing animals of cylindrical form to be fat’, but that
    a thin’ animal is more efficient at progression.'

  container-title: ACM Transactions on Graphics
  page: '1'
  volume: '32'
  abstract: 'Multi-material 3D printing allows objects to be composed of com- plex,
    heterogeneous arrangements of materials. It is often more nat- ural to define
    a functional goal than to define the material composi- tion of an object. Translating
    these functional requirements to fabri- cable 3D prints is still an open research
    problem. Recently, several specific instances of this problem have been explored
    (e.g., appear- ance or elastic deformation), but they exist as isolated, monolithic
    algorithms. In this paper, we propose an abstraction mechanism that simplifies
    the design, development, implementation, and reuse of these algorithms. Our solution
    relies on two new data structures: a reducer tree that efficiently parameterizes
    the space of material assignments and a tuner network that describes the optimization
    process used to compute material arrangement. We provide an ap- plication programming
    interface for specifying the desired object and for defining parameters for the
    reducer tree and tuner network. We illustrate the utility of our framework by
    implementing several fabrication algorithms as well as demonstrating the manufactured
    results.'

  abstract: 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.
    In this paper, a bio-inspired body caudal/fin (BCF) propelling robotic fish actuated
    by Macro Fiber Composites (MFC) smart material is developed. The fish has a length
    of 300mm and a mass of 475g, and its overall body is designed as a streamlined
    shape. The fish’s compliant tail is embedded with a bimorph actuation structure
    sandwiching a piece of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) between two MFC
    plates. The requirement of high-voltage input limits MFC’s application in untethered
    locomotion for the development of robotic fish. An on-board micro-controller with
    XBee device and high-voltage amplifier is equipped for wireless control and power
    supply. Through the experiments of performance test, the robotic fish shows its
    impressive hydrodynamic performance in the water with a maximum forward speed
    of 174mm/s (0.58BL/s) and a maximum turning speed of 7.5deg/s which proves the
    strong potential of the MFC in the development of high performance robotic fish.

  abstract: A modular robotic system consists of standardized joint and link units
    that can be assembled into a number of different kinematic configurations. This
    paper describes the design and kinematic issues of a newly developed modular robot
    aimed for assembly tasks. All modules are designed as cubic units. There are connecting
    interfaces, termed connecting ports, on all faces of the cubes so that different
    kinematic configurations can be achieved by just re-connecting the modules into
    different ports. A graph based representation scheme, termed assembly incidence
    matrices (AIM), is employed to indicate the ever changing configurations. The
    dyad kinematics based on product-of-exponentials formula is introduced. Using
    dyad kinematics along with a graph traversing algorithm, the authors are able
    to derive forward kinematics for a modular robot with specific configuration automatically.
    This formulation can be applied to modular robots with hybrid geometries and is
    demonstrated by a 3-DOF serial modular robot example View full abstract»

  abstract: An optical fiber curvature sensor based on interference between LP01-LP02modes
    of a circularly symmetric few mode fiber (FMF) is presented. The device consists
    of two single-mode fiber and a 10-cm FMF. The two single-mode fiber is offset-spliced
    to each end of the FMF. When the optical fiber is kept straight and fixed, the
    interference pattern appears in the transmitted spectrum. As the fiber device
    is bent, the visibility of the interference fringes (at 1530 nm) decreases, reaching
    values close to 0.3. The dynamic range of the device can be tailored by the proper
    selection of the length of FMF. The relationship between the fringe visibility
    and the curvature is linear while the curvature is between 11 m-1and 16 m-1. The
    result indicates that the compact sensor can be used in the measurement of large
    curvature, which is also important in structural health monitoring. 2014 Elsevier

  container-title: Journal of Biomedical Materials Research
  page: 53-62
  volume: '44'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: We have been interested in the synthesis of hydrogels with fast swelling
    kinetics and superabsorbent properties. To increase the water absorption rate,
    interconnected pores were introduced to the hydrogels. Since the pore size in
    the dried hydrogels is in the order of hundreds of micrometers, these hydrogels
    are called "superporous" hydrogels. Superporous hydrogels were synthesized by
    crosslinking polymerization of various vinyl monomers in the presence of gas bubbles
    formed by the chemical reaction of acid and NaHCO3. The polymerization process
    was optimized to capture the gas bubbles inside the synthesized hydrogels. The
    use of the NaHCO3/acid system allowed easy control of timing for gelation and
    foam formation. We found that PF127 was the best foam stabilizer for most of the
    monomer systems used in our study. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures
    showed interconnected pores forming capillary channels. The capillary channels,
    which were critical for fast swelling, were preserved during drying by dehydrating
    water-swollen hydrogels with ethanol before drying. The ethanol-dehydrated superporous
    hydrogels reached equilibrium swelling within minutes. The equilibrium swelling
    time could be reduced to less than a minute with the use of a wetting agent. In
    our study, water moisture was used as a wetting agent since the amount of moisture
    content in the dried hydrogels easily could be controlled. Preparation of superporous
    hydrogels using the right blowing system, foam stabilizer, drying method, and
    wetting agent makes it possible to reduce the swelling time to less than a minute
    regardless of the size of the dried gels. The superporous hydrogels can be used
    where fast swelling and superabsorbent properties are critical.

  title: Edge Tracking Using Tactile Servo

  abstract: A novel method to perform edge tracking using tactile sensors is presented
    in this paper. Using the tactile servo scheme, a robot manipulator is driven only
    by real-time tactile feedback from the array tactile sensors mounted directly
    on the robot end-effector. Compared with previous approaches, the control scheme
    presented in this paper is consistent and more efficient. Real-time edge tracking
    experiments are conducted using an experimental system consisting of a PUMA 260,
    a single rigid finger and a planar array tactile sensor. Experimental results
    show satisfactory control speed and accuracy for both straight and curved edge
    tracking. An example of active tactile sensing of a unknown object using edge
    tracking is also demonstrated.

  abstract: Driven by the interests in self-folding, there have been studies developing
    artificial self-folding structures at different length scales based on various
    polymer actuators that can realize dual-state actuation. However, their unidirectional
    nature limits the applicability of the actuators for a wide range of multi-state
    self-folding behaviors. In addition, complex fabrication and programming procedures
    hinder broad applications of existing polymer actuators. Moreover, few of the
    existing polymer actuators are able to show the self-folding behaviors with the
    precise control of curvature and force. To address these issues, we report an
    easy-to-fabricate triple-state actuator with controllable folding behaviors based
    on bilayer polymer composites with different glass transition temperatures. Initially,
    the fabricated actuator is in the flat state, and it can sequentially self-fold
    to angled folding states of opposite directions as it is heated up. Based on an
    analytical model and measured partial recovery b...

  abstract: '2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Porous structures have
    emerged as a breakthrough of shape-morphing hydrogels to achieve a rapid response.
    However, these porous actuators generally suffer from a lack of complexity and
    diversity in obtained 3D shapes. Herein, a simple yet versatile strategy is developed
    to generate shape-morphing hydrogels with both fast deformation and enhanced designability
    in 3D shapes by combining two promising technologies: electrospinning and 3D printing.
    Elaborate patterns are printed on mesostructured stimuli-responsive electrospun
    membranes, modulating in-plane and interlayer internal stresses induced by swelling/shrinkage
    mismatch, and thus guiding morphing behaviors of electrospun membranes to adapt
    to changes of the environment. With this strategy, a series of fast deformed hydrogel
    actuators are constructed with various distinctive responsive behaviors, including
    reversible/irreversible formations of 3D structures, folding of 3D tubes, and
    formations of 3D structures with multi low-energy states. It is worth noting that
    although poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) is chosen as the model system in the present
    research, our strategy is applicable to other stimuli-responsive hydrogels, which
    enriches designs of rapid deformed hydrogel actuators.'

  abstract: Microrobots are constructed based on processes involving lamination of
    2D materials and laser ablation. To satisfy the size constraint of the laser cutting
    field, different microrobotic components are tiled within a square template during
    the design process. Here we develop a number of automated 2D tiling algorithms
    that aim to improve microrobot fabrication efficiency. We quantify and compare
    the performance of a deterministic method, a method based on simulated annealing
    and expectation maximization, and a method based on potential functions and stochastic
    gradient descent. These methods automatically tile irregular 2D shapes within
    a template, and they can be applied to improve the fabrication efficiency of microrobotic
    components. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we design and fabricate
    102 different robot wings in the same setting, which represents over live times
    improvement compared to previous methods. Flapping experiments with these wings
    are further conducted to identify the corresponding operating conditions.

  volume: '15'

  abstract: In this paper, a physics-based model is proposed for a biomimetic robotic
    fish propelled by an ionic polymermetal composite (IPMC) actuator. Inspired by
    the biological fin structure, a passive plastic fin is further attached to the
    IPMC beam. The model incorporates both IPMC actuation dynamics and the hydrodynamics,
    and predicts the steady-state cruising speed of the robot under a given periodic
    actuation voltage. The interactions between the plastic fin and the IPMC actuator
    are also captured in the model. Experimental results have shown that the proposed
    model is able to predict the motion of robotic fish for different tail dimensions.
    Since most of the model parameters are expressed in terms of fundamental physical
    properties and geometric dimensions, the model is expected to be instrumental
    in optimal design of the robotic fish. 2006 IEEE.

  abstract: This paper focuses on printing a 2D color image by using a desktop fused
    deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer. A fully automatic framework is presented
    to convert a 2D image into a non-photorealistic line drawing which is suitable
    for 3D printing. Firstly, an image is partitioned into a moderate number of regions,
    and contours of these regions are extracted to deliver the high level abstraction
    of the image. The contour lines are further refined by taking into consideration
    the restrictions of 3D printing. Next, an orientation field based on the contours
    and feature lines at a finer level is computed to guide the placement of streamlines.
    The distances between streamlines are carefully controlled such that the density
    respects the pixel intensity values. Finally, the resulting streamlines are converted
    into printing paths and printed by using filaments with specified colors. Experimental
    results show the feasibility and efficacy of our method on portraying a given
    image by using a few of 3D printable non-intersecting lines while preserving features
    and tone variation in the image.

  container-title: IEEE international conference on intelligent robots and systems

  page: 2827-2831
  abstract: Materials with variable stiffness have the potential to provide a range
    of new functionalities, including system reconfiguration by tuning the location
    of rigid links and joints. In particular, wearable applications would benefit
    from variable stiffness materials in the context of active braces that may stiffen
    when necessary and soften when mobility is required. In this work, we present
    fibers capable of adjusting to provide variable stiffness in wearable fabrics.
    The variable stiffness fibers are made from shape memory materials, where shape
    memory alloy (SMA) is coated with a thin film of shape memory polymer (SMP). The
    fibers, which are fabricated via a continuous feed-through process, reduce in
    bending stiffness by an order of magnitude when the SMP goes through the glass
    transition. The transition between rubbery and glassy state is accomplished by
    direct joule heating of the embedded SMA wire. We employ a COMSOL model to relate
    the current input to the time required for the fibers to transition between stiffness
    states. Finally, we demonstrate how this device can be worn and act as a joint
    stability brace on human fingers.

  abstract: The embodied cognition paradigm emphasizes that both bod- ies and brains
    combine to produce complex behaviors, in con- trast to the traditional view that
    the only seat of intelligence is the brain. Despite recent excitement about embodied
    cogni- tion, brains and bodies remain thought of, and implemented as, two separate
    entities that merely interface with one an- other to carry out their respective
    roles. Previous research co-evolving bodies and brains has simulated the physics
    of bodies that collect sensory information and pass that infor- mation on to disembodied
    neural networks, which then pro- cesses that information and return motor commands.
    Biologi- cal animals, in contrast, produce behavior through physically embedded
    control structures and a complex and continuous interplay between neural and mechanical
    forces. In addition to the electrical pulses flowing through the physical wiring
    of the nervous system, the heart elegantly combines control with actuation, as
    the physical properties of the tissue itself (or defects therein) determine the
    actuation of the organ. In- spired by these phenomena from cardiac electrophysiology
    (the study of the electrical properties of heart tissue), we in- troduce electrophysiological
    robots, whose behavior is dic- tated by electrical signals flowing though the
    tissue cells of soft robots. Here we describe these robots and how they are evolved.
    Videos and images of these robots reveal lifelike behaviors despite the added
    challenge of having physically embedded control structures. We also provide an
    initial ex- perimental investigation into the impact of different imple- mentation
    decisions, such as alternatives for sensing, actua- tion, and locations of central
    pattern generators. Overall, this paper provides a first step towards removing
    the chasm be- tween bodies and brains to encourage further research into physically

  abstract: The field of soft robotics has inspired recent mechanical engineering
    and materials science innovations to enable shape-shifting systems to be developed.
    This paper presents the design and analysis of a novel thermally tunable composite,
    namely, a flexible open-cell foam coated in wax that can achieve significant ranges
    of stiffness, strength, and volume. Experimental results were compared to a proposed
    model for predicting the bulk compression modulus of the composites. Additionally,
    preliminary studies indicate that the composites exhibit self-healing properties,
    in which heating between loading cycles can mend wax that has been plastically
    deformed, for example, by cracking or delaminating from the foam.

  abstract: Ensuring the light-weight and high-strength properties of carbon-fiber
    composite materials is costly. Cheung and Gershenfeld (p. 1219, published online
    15 August; see the Perspective by Schaedler et al.) have mass-produced cross-sectional
    parts that can be assembled into strong, ultralight lattices. Carbon-fiber composites
    are sliced into cross-shaped pieces that can be independently tested and reliably
    assembled into rigid and reversible cuboctahedral lattices.We introduce composite
    materials made by reversibly assembling a three-dimensional lattice of mass-produced
    carbon fiber–reinforced polymer composite parts with integrated mechanical interlocking
    connections. The resulting cellular composite materials can respond as an elastic
    solid with an extremely large measured modulus for an ultralight material (12.3
    megapascals at a density of 7.2 milligrams per cubic centimeter). These materials
    offer a hierarchical decomposition in modeling, with bulk properties that can
    be predicted from component measurements and deformation modes that can be determined
    by the placement of part types. Because site locations are locally constrained,
    structures can be produced in a relative assembly process that merges desirable
    features of fiber composites, cellular materials, and additive manufacturing.

  container-title: Nature Communications

  page: 1-10
  volume: '10'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The lift that animal wings generate to fly is typically considered a vertical
    force that supports weight, while drag is considered a horizontal force that opposes
    thrust. To determine how birds use lift and drag, here we report aerodynamic forces
    and kinematics of Pacific parrotlets (Forpus coelestis) during short, foraging
    flights. At takeoff they incline their wing stroke plane, which orients lift forward
    to accelerate and drag upward to support nearly half of their bodyweight. Upon
    landing, lift is oriented backward to contribute a quarter of the braking force,
    which reduces the aerodynamic power required to land. Wingbeat power requirements
    are dominated by downstrokes, while relatively inactive upstrokes cost almost
    no aerodynamic power. The parrotlets repurpose lift and drag during these flights
    with lift-to-drag ratios below two. Such low ratios are within range of proto-wings,
    showing how avian precursors may have relied on drag to take off with flapping
    wings.

  abstract: Birds frequently hop and fly between tree branches to forage. To determine
    the mechanical energy trade-offs of their bimodal locomotion, we rewarded four
    Pacific parrotlets with a seed for flying voluntarily between instrumented perches
    inside a new aerodynamic force platform. By integrating direct measurements of
    both leg and wing forces with kinematics in a bimodal long jump and flight model,
    we discovered that parrotlets direct their leg impulse to minimize the mechanical
    energy needed to forage over different distances and inclinations. The bimodal
    locomotion model further shows how even a small lift contribution from a single
    proto-wingbeat would have significantly lengthened the long jump of foraging arboreal
    dinosaurs. These avian bimodal locomotion strategies can also help robots traverse
    cluttered environments more effectively.

  container-title: Journal of The Royal Society Interface
  page: '20170240'
  volume: '14'
  issue: '131'
  abstract: Harnessing flight strategies refined by millions of years of evolution
    can help expedite the design of more efficient, manoeuvrable and robust flying
    robots. This review synthesizes recent advances and highlights remaining gaps
    in our understanding of how bird and bat wing adaptations enable effective flight.
    Included in this discussion is an evaluation of how current robotic analogues
    measure up to their biological sources of inspiration. Studies of vertebrate wings
    have revealed skeletal systems well suited for enduring the loads required during
    flight, but the mechanisms that drive coordinated motions between bones and connected
    integuments remain ill-described. Similarly, vertebrate flight muscles have adapted
    to sustain increased wing loading, but a lack of in vivo studies limits our understanding
    of specific muscular functions. Forelimb adaptations diverge at the integument
    level, but both bird feathers and bat membranes yield aerodynamic surfaces with
    a level of robustness unparalleled by engineered wings. These morphological adaptations
    enable a diverse range of kinematics tuned for different flight speeds and manoeuvres.
    By integrating vertebrate flight specializations-particularly those that enable
    greater robustness and adaptability-into the design and control of robotic wings,
    engineers can begin narrowing the wide margin that currently exists between flying
    robots and vertebrates. In turn, these robotic wings can help biologists create
    experiments that would be impossible in vivo.

    for personalized walking assistance</span>
  container-title: Robotics and Autonomous Systems
  page: 66-76
  volume: '114'
  abstract: 'This paper attempts to address the problem of online modulation of virtual
    impedance for an assistive robot based on real-time gait and activity measurements
    to personalize the assistance for different users at different states. In this
    work, smart shoes and inertial sensors are introduced to measure ground contact
    forces and knee joint kinematics, respectively. An automatic impedance tuning
    (AIT) approach is presented for a knee assistive device (KAD) based on real-time
    activity recognition and gait phase detection. The activities considered in this
    paper are level, uphill, and downhill walking. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
    is employed to map the fuzzy likelihood of various activities and gait phases
    to the desired virtual impedance of the KAD. The prior estimate of virtual impedance
    is defined using human knee impedance identified with the walking data collected
    on different users. The AIT approach is integrated into the high-level impedance-based
    controller of the KAD for assistance during the stance phase. Finally, to evaluate
    the benefit of the proposed algorithm in stance phase, an EMG sensor is placed
    on the vastus medialis muscle group of three participants. The proposed approach
    is compared with two baseline approaches: constant impedance and finite state
    machine, and the results demonstrate that the profiles of impedance parameters
    and robot assistive torque are smoother and the muscle activity of vastus medialis
    is reduced. It is also noticed that the participants reduce their step lengths
    and increase walking cadence with assistance from the KAD.'

  container-title: 2017 american control conference (acc)
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 1462-1467
  abstract: 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC). This paper presents an
    intelligent fuzzy inference (IFI) algorithm using inertial measurement units (IMUs)
    and smart shoes to recognize human activities. IFI algorithm recognizes the activities
    based on ground contact forces (GCFs) and the knee joint angles. The smart shoes
    are designed to measure GCFs exerted by the wearer. A total of four IMUs are mounted
    on bilateral thighs and shanks to provide acceleration and angular rate data.
    To calculate knee flexion extension, a calibration procedure is adopted which
    eliminates the need for an external camera system. Then, an extended Kalman filter
    (EKF) is used to estimate the relative orientations of thigh and shank segments,
    from which knee angle is calculated. Random forest search (RFS) technique is used
    as a baseline to compare with the performance of the IFI algorithm. To evaluate
    the performance of this algorithm, several outdoor experiments are conducted on
    two healthy subjects for six activities including sitting, standing, walking,
    going upstairs, going downstairs and jogging. The results show that the algorithm
    is capable of classifying six activities with higher precision and less update
    time compared to the baseline approach for both subject dependent and independent
    tests. Also, the algorithm detects transitions between all the activities smoothly
    such as sit-to-stand or stand-to-walk with higher precision.

  abstract: Among the different types of direct digital manufacturing (DDM) technologies,
    some of them can be used for making functionally graded material (FGM) objects.
    Apart from specific characteristics of the DDM process being employed, one problem
    in FGM object fabrication is the generation of the corresponding information complete
    format so that the functionally graded material information can be realized. In
    this paper, this issue is addressed and the three-dimensional printing (3DP) process
    is considered as the DDM technology employed for making a FGM prototype. The property
    of printing a 3D prototype in color is adopted and a methodology is proposed for
    representing the mechanical properties of an FGM object by color information.
    In this methodology, an object is considered as "functionally graded" if its mechanical
    strength is gradually changed within the object and the mechanical strength arisen
    from gluing powdered material by binders in 3DP is assumed to be proportional
    to the concentrations of the binders applied in it. If the concentration of each
    primary color binder is different and a pixel of color is printed in the appropriate
    proportion, the resultant pixel would have a corresponding binder concentration
    value. To determine the binder concentration requirements, a computer-aided engineering
    (CAE) analysis is first carried out and the concentration requirements in different
    parts of the object are inferred from the CAE analysis result. These requirements
    are then converted to color information by applying the proposed methodology.
    As the binder concentrations of different colors are different, a colorful prototype
    would also be an FGM one. 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

    representation of objects with LCC into discrete (pointwise) version of machine
    instructions. The algorithm presented effectively reduces undesirable low frequency
    textures of composition for individual 3D layers and also for 3D volumes. Peculiarities
    of the 3D printing machine, including anisotropic geometry of its picture elements
    (PELs) and uncertainties in droplet placement, are addressed by adapting a standard
    digital halftoning algorithm. Without loss of generality, our algorithm also accounts
    for technical limitations in the printing device, only generating lattices that
    can be represented within the finite memory limits of the hardware. 2003 Elsevier

  publisher: Cambridge University Press
  publisher-place: New York
  abstract: The optimum performance design of composite microstructures is discussed.
    The forces driving progress in fiber composites are examined, and recent developments
    in the mechanics of laminated composites are surveyed, emphasizing thick laminates,
    hygrothermal effects, and thermal transient effects. The strength of continuous-fiber
    composites is discussed, presenting analyses of local load redistribution due
    to fiber breakages and treatments of statistical tensile strength theories. Modes
    of failure of laminated composites are examined. Elastic, physical, and viscoelastic
    properties as well as the strength and fracture behavior of short-fiber composites
    are studied, and it is shown how the performance of composites can be controlled
    by selecting material systems and their geometric distributions. 2D textile structural
    composites based on woven, knitted, and braided preforms are considered, and techniques
    for analyzing and modeling the thermomechanical behavior of 2D textile composites
    are presented. Recent developments in the processing of 3D textile preforms are
    introduced and the processing-microstructure relationship is demonstrated. Finite
    elastic deformation of flexible composites is addressed.

  title: <span class="nocase">Transfer from Simulation to Real World through Learning
    Deep Inverse Dynamics Model</span>
  abstract: Developing control policies in simulation is often more practical and
    safer than directly running experiments in the real world. This applies to policies
    obtained from planning and optimization, and even more so to policies obtained
    from reinforcement learning, which is often very data demanding. However, a policy
    that succeeds in simulation often doesn’t work when deployed on a real robot.
    Nevertheless, often the overall gist of what the policy does in simulation remains
    valid in the real world. In this paper we investigate such settings, where the
    sequence of states traversed in simulation remains reasonable for the real world,
    even if the details of the controls are not, as could be the case when the key
    differences lie in detailed friction, contact, mass and geometry properties. During
    execution, at each time step our approach computes what the simulation-based control
    policy would do, but then, rather than executing these controls on the real robot,
    our approach computes what the simulation expects the resulting next state(s)
    will be, and then relies on a learned deep inverse dynamics model to decide which
    real-world action is most suitable to achieve those next states. Deep models are
    only as good as their training data, and we also propose an approach for data
    collection to (incrementally) learn the deep inverse dynamics model. Our experiments
    shows our approach compares favorably with various baselines that have been developed
    for dealing with simulation to real world model discrepancy, including output
    error control and Gaussian dynamics adaptation.

  abstract: We describe a robot, possessing limited sensory and effectory capabilties
    but no initial model of the effects of its actions on the world, that acquires
    such a model through exploration, practice, and observation. By acquiring an increasingly
    correct model of its actions, it generates increasingly successful plans to achieve
    its goals. In an apparently non-deterministic world, achieving reliability requires
    the identification of reliable actions and a preference for using such actions.
    Furthermore, by selecting its training carefully, the robot can significantly
    improve its learning rate.

    flattening</span>
  container-title: Computer-Aided Design
  page: 473-481
  volume: '28'
  issue: 6-7
  abstract: The purpose of this research is to propose a method for automatic flattening
    of surface features, which are decomposed from a solid model, into 2D flat models.
    In this research, a sheet metal product is described as a solid model. Using a
    feature decomposition method, the boundary representation of the solid model is
    decomposed into surface features, and each feature is represented as a face-edge
    graph. Among the faces in a feature, an appropriate one is selected as the base
    face. With the base face as a root, a spanning tree is constructed from the face-edge
    graph of the feature, and edges for splitting and folding, respectively, are identified.
    Thereafter, the faces, other than the base face, are rotated to the plane of the
    base face around their folding axes, and the 2D flat model for a feature can be
    obtained. According to the messages identifying edges requiring folding or fastening,
    manufacturers can produce the feature using the reverse process of flattening.
    Also, computer graphics is used to animate the feature decomposition and flattening
    procedures.

  volume: '2'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: This study focuses on the design and analysis of underactuated robotic
    hands that use tendons and compliant joints to enable passive mechanical adaptation
    during grasping tasks. We use a quasistatic equilibrium formulation to predict
    the stability of a given grasp. This method is then used as the inner loop of
    an optimization algorithm that can find a set of actuation mechanism parameters
    that optimize the stability measure for an entire set of grasps. We discuss two
    possible approaches to design optimization using this framework, one using exhaustive
    search over the parameter space, and the other using a simplified gripper construction
    to cast the problem to a form that is directly solvable using well-established
    optimization methods. Computations are performed in 3-D, allow arbitrary geometry
    of the grasped objects and take into account frictional constraints.

  container-title: The International Journal of Robotics Research
  page: 753-767
  volume: '33'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: We design, optimize and demonstrate the behavior of a tendon-driven robotic
    gripper performing parallel, enveloping and fingertip grasps. The gripper consists
    of two fingers, each with two links, and is actuated using a single active tendon.
    During unobstructed closing, the distal links remain parallel, for parallel grasps.
    If the proximal links are stopped by contact with an object, the distal links
    start flexing, creating a stable enveloping grasp. We optimize the route of the
    active flexor tendon and the route and stiffness of a passive extensor tendon
    in order to achieve this behavior. We show how the resulting gripper can also
    execute fingertip grasps for picking up small objects off a flat surface, using
    contact with the surface to its advantage through passive adaptation. Finally,
    we introduce a method for optimizing the dimensions of the links in order to achieve
    enveloping grasps of a large range of objects, and apply it to a set of common
    household objects.

  volume: '43'

  abstract: In the free walking rock lobster the forces developed by legs 4 and 5
    were investigated during the power stroke. Two orthogonal force components lying
    in the horizontal plane were measured. Based on these results the diffent tasks
    of the two legs during walking are discussed. The forces developed by leg 4 were
    compared when the animal walked freely and on a treadmill. In these two situations
    the results differ qualitatively as in driven walking the forces are nearly identical
    in a long series of consecutive steps whereas in free walking the forces can vary
    greatly from step to step. However, similar mean values of force were measured
    with those on the treadmill being somewhat higher. This shows that, although the
    treadmill is driven by a motor, the animal does perform active walking movements.
    In the treadmill situation the forces increase as the speed of treadmill motor
    is decreased. 1982 Springer-Verlag.

  abstract: Experiments are reported on the hydrodynamic performance of a flexible
    fin. The fin replicates some features of the pectoral fin of a batoid fish (such
    as a ray or skate) in that it is actuated in a travelling wave motion, with the
    amplitude of the motion increasing linearly along the span from root to tip. Thrust
    is found to increase with non-dimensional frequency, and an optimal oscillatory
    gait is identified. Power consumption measurements lead to the computation of
    propulsive efficiency, and an optimal efficiency condition is evaluated. Wake
    visualizations are presented, and a vortex model of the wake near zero net thrust
    is suggested. Strouhal number effects on the wake topology are also illustrated.

  abstract: Rigid body dynamics with contact constraints can be solved locally using
    linear complementarity techniques. However, these techniques do not impose the

    stabilization can also be done in a complementarity framework. Our technique effectively
    eliminates the drift problem for both equality and inequality constraints and
    requires no parameter tweaking. We describe results from an implemented system,
    and compare the new technique to the well known Baumgarte stabilization.

  abstract: 'This paper is based on the premises that the purpose of engineering education
    is to graduate engineers who can design, and that design thinking is complex.
    The paper begins by briefly reviewing the history and role of design in the engineering
    curriculum. Several dimensions of design thinking are then detailed, explaining
    why design is hard to learn and harder still to teach, and outlining the research
    available on how well design thinking skills are learned. The currently most-favored
    pedagogical model for teaching design, project-based learning (PBL), is explored
    next, along with available assessment data on its success. Two contexts for PBL
    are emphasized: first-year cornerstone courses and globally dispersed PBL courses.
    Finally, the paper lists some of the open research questions that must be answered
    to identify the best pedagogical practices of improving design learning, after
    which it closes by making recommendations for research aimed at enhancing design
    learning. Keywords: design thinking, project-based learning, c'

  container-title: Robotics and Autonomous Systems
  page: 195-218
  volume: '37'
  abstract: Properties of the human embodiment - sensorimotor apparatus and neurological
    structure - participate directly in the growth and development of cognitive processes
    against enormous worst case complexity. It is our position that relationships
    between morphology and perception over time lead to increasingly comprehensive
    models that describe the agent’s relationship to the world. We are applying insight
    derived from neuroscience, neurology, and developmental psychology to the design
    of advanced robot architectures. To investigate developmental processes, we have
    begun to approximate the human sensorimotor configuration and to engage sensory
    and motor subsystems in developmental sequences. Many such sequences have been
    documented in studies of infant development, so we intend to bootstrap cognitive
    structures in robots by emulating some of these growth processes that bear an
    essential resemblance to the human morphology. In this paper, we will show two
    related examples in which a humanoid robot determines the models and representations
    that govern its behavior. The first is a model that captures the dynamics of a
    haptic exploration of an object with a dextrous robot hand that supports skillful
    grasping. The second example constructs constellations of visual features to predict
    relative hand/object postures that lead reliably to haptic utility. The result
    is a first step in a trajectory toward associative visual-haptic categories that
    bounds the incremental complexity of each stage of development.

  abstract: The term “design experiments” was introduced in 1992, in articles by Ann
    Brown (1992) and Allan Collins (1992). Design experiments were developed as a
    way to carry out formative research to test and refine educational designs based
    on princi- ples derived from prior research. More recently the term design research
    has been ap- plied to this kind of work. In this article, we outline the goals
    of design research and how it is related to other methodologies.We illustrate
    how design research is carried out with two very different examples. And we provide
    guidelines for how design re- search can best be carried out in the future.

    exoskeleton</span>
  container-title: Nature
  page: 212-215
  volume: '522'
  issue: '7555'
  abstract: With efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning, humans
    are very well-tuned for locomotion. Metabolic energy used during walking can be
    partly replaced by power input from an exoskeleton, but is it possible to reduce
    metabolic rate without providing an additional energy source? This would require
    an improvement in the efficiency of the human-machine system as a whole, and would
    be remarkable given the apparent optimality of human gait. Here we show that the
    metabolic rate of human walking can be reduced by an unpowered ankle exoskeleton.
    We built a lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the user’s calf
    muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the metabolic energy consumed
    in contractions. The device uses a mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is
    stretched and relaxed by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping
    to fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon. Unlike muscles,
    however, the clutch sustains force passively. The exoskeleton consumes no chemical
    or electrical energy and delivers no net positive mechanical work, yet reduces
    the metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 ± 2.6

  abstract: Here we present the design of a passive-dynamics based, fully autonomous,
    3-D, bipedal walking robot that uses simple control, consumes little energy, and
    has human-like morphology and gait. Design aspects covered here include the freely
    rotating hip joint with angle bisecting mechanism; freely rotating knee joints
    with latches; direct actuation of the ankles with a spring, release mechanism,
    and reset motor; wide feet that are shaped to aid lateral stability; and the simple
    control algorithm. The biomechanics context of this robot is discussed in more
    detail in \[1\], and movies of the robot walking are available at Science Online
    and http://www.tam.cornell.edu/$\sim$ruina/powerwalk.html. This robot adds evidence
    to the idea that passive-dynamic approaches might help design walking robots that
    are simpler, more efficient and easier to control.

    and production volume. Complexity and customization scales enable the grouping
    of products into regions of the map with common levels of the three attributes.
    A geometric complexity factor developed for cast parts is modified for a more
    general application. Parts with varying geometric complexity are then analyzed
    and mapped into regions of the complexity, customization, and production volume
    model. A discrete set of customization levels are also introduced. Implications
    for product development and manufacturing business approaches are discussed.'

  abstract: We report on a novel biomimetic sensor that allows sensitive and specific
    detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli)bacteria in a broad concentration range
    from 10 2 up to 10 6 CFU/mL in both buffer fluids and relevant food samples (i.e.
    apple juice). The receptors are surface-imprinted polyurethane layers deposited
    on stainless-steel chips. Regarding the transducer principle, the sensor measures
    the increase in thermal resistance between the chip and the liquid due to the
    presence of bacteria captured on the receptor surface. The low noise level that
    enables the low detection limit originates from a planar meander element that
    serves as both a heater and a temperature sensor. Furthermore, the experiments
    show that the presence of bacteria in a liquid enhances the thermal conductivity
    of the liquid itself. Reference tests with a set of other representative species
    of Enterobacteriaceae, closely related to E. coli, indicate a very low cross-sensitivity
    with a sensor response at or below the noise level.

  abstract: This paper summarizes lessons learned from the first Amazon Picking Challenge
    in which 26 international teams designed robotic systems that competed to retrieve
    items from warehouse shelves. This task is currently performed by human workers,
    and there is hope that robots can someday help increase efficiency and throughput
    while lowering cost. We report on a 28-question survey posed to the teams to learn
    about each team’s background, mechanism design, perception apparatus, planning
    and control approach. We identify trends in this data, correlate it with each
    team’s success in the competition, and discuss observations and lessons learned.

  abstract: High-precision maneuvers at high angles-of-attack are not properly addressed
    by even the most advanced aircraft control systems. Here we present our control
    design procedure and indoor experimental results with a small fixed-wing autonomous
    glider which is capable of executing an aggressive high angle-of-attack maneuver
    in order to land on a perch. We first acquire a surprisingly accurate aircraft
    model through unsteady flight regimes from real kinematic flight data taken in
    a motion-capture arena. This model is then used in a numerical nonlinear (approximate)
    optimal control procedure which designs a feedback control policy for the elevator
    deflection. Finally, we report our experimental data demonstrating that this simple
    glider can exploit pressure drag to achieve a high-speed perching maneuver.

    lunar regolith simulant, JSC-1A, has demonstrated a 15 x (fifteen times) reduction
    in the downforce necessary to penetrate the regolith. Downforce reductions of
    this magnitude are sufficient to enable robotic exploration system architectures
    that would not otherwise be feasible.

    effects of obstacle orientation, body size and acceleration</span>'
  container-title: J. Exp. Biol.
  page: 2728-2737
  volume: '218'
  issue: Pt 17
  abstract: Locomotion through structurally complex environments is fundamental to
    the life history of most flying animals, and the costs associated with movement
    through clutter have important consequences for the ecology and evolution of volant
    taxa. However, few studies have directly investigated how flying animals navigate
    through cluttered environments, or examined which aspects of flight performance
    are most critical for this challenging task. Here, we examined how body size,
    acceleration and obstacle orientation affect the flight of bumblebees in an artificial,
    cluttered environment. Non-steady flight performance is often predicted to decrease
    with body size, as a result of a presumed reduction in acceleration capacity,
    but few empirical tests of this hypothesis have been performed in flying animals.
    We found that increased body size is associated with impaired flight performance
    (specifically transit time) in cluttered environments, but not with decreased
    peak accelerations. In addition, previous studies have shown that flying insects
    can produce higher accelerations along the lateral body axis, suggesting that
    if maneuvering is constrained by acceleration capacity, insects should perform
    better when maneuvering around objects laterally rather than vertically. Our data
    show that bumblebees do generate higher accelerations in the lateral direction,
    but we found no difference in their ability to pass through obstacle courses requiring
    lateral versus vertical maneuvering. In sum, our results suggest that acceleration
    capacity is not a primary determinant of flight performance in clutter, as is
    often assumed. Rather than being driven by the scaling of acceleration, we show
    that the reduced flight performance of larger bees in cluttered environments is
    driven by the allometry of both path sinuosity and mean flight speed. Specifically,
    differences in collision-avoidance behavior underlie much of the variation in
    flight performance across body size, with larger bees negotiating obstacles more
    cautiously. Thus, our results show that cluttered environments challenge the flight
    capacity of insects, but in surprising ways that emphasize the importance of behavioral
    and ecological context for understanding flight performance in complex environments.

  container-title: Journal of Sound and Vibration
  page: 3-IN1
  volume: '11'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: In many applications of vibration and wave theory the magnitudes of the
    damping forces are small in comparison with the elastic and inertia forces. These
    small forces may, however, have very great influence under certain special circumstances.
    Damping arises from the removal of energy by radiation or dissipation. It is generally
    measured under conditions of cyclic or near-cyclic motion. The nature of some
    important damping mechanisms is discussed and an indication is given of how the
    damping depends on the amplitude and frequency of the cyclic motion. The idealized
    models of damping which are commonly employed in theoretical analyses are described
    and some limitations are noted. Damping is of primary importance in controlling
    vibration response amplitudes under conditions of steady-state resonance and stationary
    random excitation. Damping also plays a crucial role in fixing the borderline
    between stability and instability in many dynamical systems. Some examples which
    illustrate this are discussed, including shaft whirl, and pipeline flutter. 1970

    renditions of objects designed with computers and manufacturedfrom a CAD database,

    reliability to achieve, in one operation, shapes that wouldrequire multiple operations
    or in some cases be impossible towith standard techniques. Automated manufacturing
    technologiesgeneral are well suited to large production numbers, but ill suitedlow-volume
    runs. In the latter case, the components are too few toamortize the cost of part-specific
    tooling; instead, they aremade by hand at much greater unit cost and longer completion.
    Nor is it a completely desirable low-volume option to interfacesystems with numerically

  abstract: Research into the developmental of artificial mechanical hands for prosthetic
    applications has been conducted over many hundreds of years. Dexterous mechanical
    hands are now being applied to advanced robotic applications, including tele-operated
    manipulators. The successful application of dexterous mechanical hands depends
    on the development of suitable mechanisms, actuators and control strategies. Recently
    the requirement arose for a manipulator to fit and operate within a standard glove
    box glove. The design and development of a fully anthropomorphic dexterous end
    effector for the manipulator is discussed in this paper. To arrive at the final
    design a study of the operation of the human hand was undertaken. The end effector
    consists of four mechanically adaptive fingers and a thumb. The mechanism developed
    for the fingers will simulate the curl of the human finger. The complete finger
    mechanism requires only a single actuator to produce fully the required motion,
    leading to a compact design for the end effector. To gain the full operational
    advantage of the dexterous hand a control strategy has been developed based on
    global sensing and a hierarchical control structure. The results of handling trials
    are presented.

  container-title: Biological Journal of the Linnean Society
  page: 381-391
  volume: '87'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: 'The Palaearctic genus Arvicola includes two species: the south-western
    water vole A.sapidus, and the northern water vole A.terrestris. The latter has
    semiaquatic and/or subterranean populations, while populations of A.sapidus are
    always semiaquatic. According to the current phylogenetic and palaeontological
    data, adaptation to semiaquatic life is plesiomorphic for the genus Arvicola.
    We studied the ontogenetic allometry of skull and long bones of the semiaquatic
    A.sapidus, a semiaquatic population of A.terrestris (A.t.italicus), and two fossorial
    populations of A.terrestris (A.t.scherman and A.t.monticola). Animals from fossorial
    populations were smaller than were those from semiaquatic populations. We found
    that most of the ontogenetic allometric exponents of characters linked to digging
    in the skull and in the long bones were significantly higher in A.t.monticola,
    a fossorial clade, than they were in the semiaquatic populations. On the other
    hand, there may have been an evolutionary lag between invasion of the hypogeic
    habitat and the acquisition of fossorial adaptations in A.t.scherman. We showed
    statistically that the morphological differences linked to the invasion of a hypogeic
    habitat are already present in juvenile animals and, according to these results,
    suggest that these morphological differences are the direct expression of genetic
    changes rather than the outcome of epigenetic factors of mechanical origin. Moreover,
    we tried to ascertain whether the apomorphic shape of the skull and long bones
    in the fossorial populations of A.terrestris (compared with the primitive condition

    a heterochronic process. Optimization by squared change parsimony supported the
    hypothesis of an apomorphic reduction of body size linked to the invasion of the
    subterranean habitat. The comparison of the ontogenetic trajectories of both skull
    shape and long bone shape suggested that a heterochronic process was involved
    in this morphological transformation. By using the ‘clock model’ method, this
    mechanism was identified as ‘accelerated dwarfism’ affecting both the skull and

  abstract: South American electric knifefish are a leading model system within neurobiology.
    Recent efforts have focused on understanding their biomechanics and relating this
    to their neural processing strategies. Knifefish swim by means of an undulatory
    fin that runs most of the length of their body, affixed to the belly. Propelling
    themselves with this fin enables them to keep their body relatively straight while
    swimming, enabling straightforward robotic implementation with a rigid hull. In
    this study, we examined the basic properties of undulatory swimming through use
    of a robot that was similar in some key respects to the knifefish. As we varied
    critical fin kinematic variables such as frequency, amplitude, and wavelength
    of sinusoidal traveling waves, we measured the force generated by the robot when
    it swam against a stationary sensor, and its velocity while swimming freely within
    a flow tunnel system. Our results show that there is an optimal operational region
    in the fin’s kinematic parameter space. The optimal actuation parameters found
    for the robotic knifefish are similar to previously observed parameters for the
    black ghost knifefish, Apteronotus albifrons. Finally, we used our experimental
    results to show how the force generated by the robotic fin can be decomposed into
    thrust and drag terms. Our findings are useful for future bio-inspired underwater
    vehicles as well as for understanding the mechanics of knifefish swimming.

  issue: '2'
  abstract: The authors express the compliance of the grasp of a robotic hand as a
    function of grasp geometry, contact conditions between the fingers and the grasped
    object, and mechanical properties of the fingers. It is argued that the effects
    of structural compliance and small changes in the grasp geometry should be included
    in the computation. Factors are then examined that can lead a grasp to become
    unstable, independently of whether it satisfies force closure. Finally, the authors
    examine the reverse problem of how to specify servo gains at the joints of a robotic
    hand so as to achieve, as nearly as possible, a desired overall grasp compliance.
    It is shown that coupling between the joints of different fingers is useful in
    this context

  abstract: Current analytical models of grasping and manipulation with robotic hands
    contain simplifications and assumptions that limit their application to manufacturing
    environments. To evaluate these models, a study was undertaken of the grasps used
    by machinists in a small batch manufacturing operation. Based on the study, a
    taxonomy of grasps was constructed. An expert system was also developed to clarify
    the issues involved in human grasp choice. Comparisons of the grasp taxonomy,
    the expert system, and grasp-quality measures derived from the analytic models
    reveal that the analytic measures are useful for describing grasps in manufacturing
    tasks despite the limitations in the models. In addition, the grasp taxonomy provides
    insights for the design of versatile robotic hands for manufacturing

  abstract: This chapter provides an overview of force and tactile sensing, with the
    primary emphasis placed on tactile sensing. We begin by presenting some basic
    considerations in choosing a tactile sensor and then review a wide variety of
    sensor types, including proximity, kinematic, force, dynamic, contact, skin deflection,
    thermal, and pressure sensors. We also review various transduction methods, appropriate
    for each general sensor type. We consider the information that these various types
    of sensors provide in terms of whether they are most useful for manipulation,
    surface exploration or being responsive to contacts from external agents. Concerning
    the interpretation of tactile information, we describe the general problems and
    present two short illustrative examples. The first involves intrinsic tactile
    sensing, i.e., estimating contact locations and forces from force sensors. The
    second involves contact pressure sensing, i.e., estimating surface normal and
    shear stress distributions from an array of sensors in an elastic skin. We conclude
    with a brief discussion of the challenges that remain to be solved in packaging
    and manufacturing damage-tolerant tactile sensors.

  abstract: New multi-material rapid prototyping processes are making possible the
    design and fabrication of bioinspired robot structures that share some of the
    desirable properties of animal appendages. The structures combine stiff and compliant
    materials and incorporate sensors and other discrete components, resulting in
    robots that are less demanding to control than traditionally designed robots and
    more robust. Current challenges include extending this approach to the structures
    that involve microscopic as well as macroscopic features.

    enables high-volume fabrication of microscopes from 2D media. Flexure mechanisms

  abstract: 'Grid technologies enable large-scale sharing of resources within formal
    or informal consortia of individuals and/or institutions: what are sometimes called
    virtual organizations. In these settings, the discovery, characterization, and
    monitoring of resources, services, and computations are challenging problems due
    to the considerable diversity; large numbers, dynamic behavior, and geographical
    distribution of the entities in which a user might be interested. Consequently,
    information services are a vital part of any Grid software infrastructure, providing
    fundamental mechanisms for discovery and monitoring, and hence for planning and
    adapting application behavior. We present an information services architecture
    that addresses performance, security, scalability, and robustness requirements.
    Our architecture defines simple low-level enquiry and registration protocols that
    make it easy to incorporate individual entities into various information structures,
    such as aggregate directories that support a variety of different query languages
    and discovery strategies. These protocols can also be combined with other Grid
    protocols to construct additional higher-level services and capabilities such
    as brokering, monitoring, fault detection, and troubleshooting. Our architecture
    has been implemented as MDS-2, which forms part of the Globus Grid toolkit and
    has been widely deployed and applied'

  abstract: The Kutzbach-Grubler mobility criterion calculates the degrees ofof a
    general mechanism. However the criterion can break down forwith special geometries,
    and in particular the class of-called overconstrained parallel mechanisms. The
    problem is that thetreats all constraints as active, even redundant constraints,do
    not affect the mechanism degrees of freedom. In this paper wea number of screw
    systems of a parallel mechanism, explore their-relationship and develop an original
    theoretical framework tothese screw systems to motion and constraints of a parallelto
    identify the platform constraints, mechanism constraintsredundant constraints.
    The screw system characteristics andare investigated for physical properties and
    a newto mobility analysis is proposed based on decompositions ofand constraint
    screw systems. New versions of the mobilityare thus presented to eliminate the
    redundant constraints andpredict the platform degrees of freedom. Several examples
    ofmechanisms from the literature illustrate the results.

    by examining the in vivo force-length performance of the guinea fowl Numida meleagris

  abstract: In order to save time of digging hole when trees are planted, a robot
    that has six degrees of freedom is developed. In this paper the structure and
    function of a forestation hole digging robot is introduced and analyzed. At the
    same time, by the experiment it can be proved that the efficiency of the robot
    is very high and the ground surface destroyed by the robot is very small. The
    maximum diameter of the digging hole is 0.55m, a seedling tree can be planted
    in the hole. Furthermore, it is also very useful to eradicate stumps in forest
    area. 2010 IEEE.

  container-title: 2013 ieee international conference on robotics and automation

  page: 5600-5605
  abstract: Subterranean exploration so far has primarily been performed with the
    assistance and involvement of human beings. As more ground is broken and more
    layers are explored, the need for a robotic solution to make digging both easier
    and safer becomes greater. The applications of a self-burying robot extend from
    mining and military applications to humanitarian applications. This paper elucidates
    design principles that form the foundation for self burying robots. In this paper,
    a bimodal robot is described which is capable of travelling above-ground in one
    mode and capable of burying itself in the other mode. The variables that affect
    digging are examined, as well as the design decisions made in order to optimize
    the resources available to the robot. Finally, future work in the area of self-burying
    robots is discussed.

  volume: '16'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Despite the rapid advance of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies
    in recent years, methods to fully encase objects with multilayer, thick features
    are still undeveloped. This issue can be overcome by printing layers conformally
    about an object’s natural bound-ary, as opposed to current methods that utilize
    planar layering. With this mindset, two methods are derived to generate layers
    between the boundaries of initial and desired geo-metric objects in both two and
    three dimensions. The first method is based on variable offset curves (VOCs) and
    is applicable to pairs of initial and desired geometric objects that satisfy mild
    compatibility conditions. In this method, layers are generated by uni-formly partitioning
    each of the normal line segments emanating from the initial object boundary and
    intersecting the desired object. The second method is based on manipu-lated solutions
    to Laplace’s equation and is applicable to all geometric objects. Using each method,
    we present examples of layer generation for several objects of varying con-vexities.
    Results are compared, and the respective advantages and limitations of each method
    are discussed.

  abstract: This paper presents the mechanical design for a new five fingered, twenty
    degree-of-freedom dexterous hand patterned after human anatomy and actuated by
    Shape Memory Alloy artificial muscles. Two experimental prototypes of a finger,
    one fabricated by traditional means and another fabricated by rapid prototyping
    techniques, are described and used to evaluate the design. An important aspect
    of the Rapid Prototype technique used here is that this multi-articulated hand
    will be fabricated in one step, without requiring assembly, while maintaining
    its desired mobility. The use of Shape Memory Alloy actuators combined with the
    rapid fabrication of the non-assembly type hand, reduce considerably its weight
    and fabrication time. Therefore, the focus of this paper is the mechanical design
    of a dexterous hand that combines Rapid Prototype techniques and smart actuators.
    The type of robotic hand described in this paper can be utilized for applications
    requiring low weight, compactness, and dexterity such as prosthetic devices, space
    and planetary exploration.

  container-title: Journal of rehabilitation research and development
  page: 261-71
  volume: '37'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: This paper presents the design of a body-powered voluntary closing prosthetic
    hand. It is argued that the movement of the fingers before establishing a grip
    is much less relevant for good control of the object held than the distribution
    of forces once the object has been contacted. Based on this notion, the configurations
    of forces on the fingers and the force transmission through the whole mechanism
    were taken as a point of departure for the design, rather than movement characteristics.
    For a good distribution of pinching forces on the object and a natural behavior,
    the prosthesis is made adaptive and flexible. To achieve good force feedback,
    the disturbing influences of the cosmetic glove are strongly reduced by a compensation
    mechanism. To further improve the transmission of forces, friction is reduced
    by furnishing the whole mechanism with rolling links. This force-directed design
    approach has led to a simple mechanism with low operating force and good feedback
    of the pinching force.

    Composition of Templates</span>'
  publisher: University of Pennsylvania Department of Electrical & Systems Engineering
  abstract: We have built a 12DOF, passive-compliant legged, tailed biped actuated
    by four brushless DC motors. We anticipate that this machine will achieve varied
    modes of quasistatic and dynamic balance, enabling a broad range of locomotion
    tasks including sitting, standing, walking, hopping, running, turning, leaping,
    and more. Achieving this diversity of behavior with a single under-actuated body,
    requires a correspondingly diverse array of controllers, motivating our interest
    in compositional techniques that promote mixing and reuse of a relatively few
    base constituents to achieve a combinatorially growing array of available choices.
    Here we report on the development of one important example of such a behavioral
    programming method, the construction of a novel monopedal sagittal plane hopping
    gait through parallel composition of four decoupled 1DOF base controllers. For
    this example behavior, the legs are locked in phase and the body is fastened to
    a boom to restrict motion to the sagittal plane. The platform’s locomotion is
    powered by the hip motor that adjusts leg touchdown angle in flight and balance
    in stance, along with a tail motor that adjusts body shape in flight and drives
    energy into the passive leg shank spring during stance. The motor control signals
    arise from the application in parallel of four simple, completely decoupled 1DOF
    feedback laws that provably stabilize in isolation four corresponding 1DOF abstract
    reference plants. Each of these abstract 1DOF closed loop dynamics represents
    some simple but crucial specific component of the locomotion task at hand. We
    present a partial proof of correctness for this parallel composition of template
    reference systems along with data from the physical platform suggesting these
    templates are anchored as evidenced by the correspondence of their characteristic
    motions with a suitably transformed image of traces from the physical platform.

  container-title: Multi-objective evolutionary optimisation for product design and
    manufacturing
  page: 1-24
  abstract: As the name suggests, multi-objective optimization involves optimizing
    a number of objectives si- multaneously. The problem becomes challenging when
    the objectives are of conflict to each other, that is, the optimal solution of
    an objective function is different from that of the other. In solving such problems,
    with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set
    of trade-off opti- mal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions.
    Due to the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved
    suitably using evolutionary algorithms which use a population ap- proach in its
    search procedure. Starting with parameterized procedures in early nineties, the
    so-called evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms is now an
    established field of research and application with many dedicated texts and edited
    books, commercial softwares and numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual
    conference series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and workshops
    held at all major evolutionary computing conferences, and full-time researchers
    from uni- versities and industries from all around the globe. In this chapter,
    we provide a brief introduction to its operating principles and outline the current
    research and application studies of EMO.

    and folding</span>
  container-title: Biology Open
  page: 638-644
  volume: '5'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Earwig wings are highly foldable structures that lack internal muscles.
    The behaviour and shape changes of the wings during flight are yet unknown. We
    assume that they meet a great structural challenge to control the occurring deformations
    and prevent the wing from collapsing. At the folding structures especially, the
    wing could easily yield to the pressure. Detailed microscopy studies reveal adaptions
    in the structure and material which are not relevant for folding purposes. The
    wing is parted into two structurally different areas with, for example, a different
    trend or stiffness of the wing veins. The storage of stiff or more flexible material
    shows critical areas which undergo great changes or stress during flight. We verified
    this with high-speed video recordings. These reveal the extent of the occurring
    deformations and their locations, and support our assumptions. The video recordings
    reveal a dynamical change of a concave flexion line. In the static unfolded state,
    this flexion line blocks a folding line, so that the wing stays unfolded. However,
    during flight it extends and blocks a second critical folding line and prevents
    the wing from collapsing. With these results, more insight in passive wing control,
    especially within high foldable structures, is gained.

  container-title: IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots
  page: 279-286
  volume: 2015-Febru
  abstract: We present a new method for planning footstep placements for a robot walking
    on uneven terrain with obsta- cles, using a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained
    quadratic program (MIQCQP). Our approach is unique in that it handles obstacle
    avoidance, kinematic reachability, and rotation of footstep placements, which
    typically have required non-convex constraints, in a single mixed-integer optimization
    that can be efficiently solved to its global optimum. Reachability is enforced
    through a convex inner approximation of the reachable space for the robot’s feet.
    Rotation of the footsteps is handled by a piecewise linear approximation of sine
    and cosine, designed to ensure that the approximation never overestimates the
    robot’s reachability. Obstacle avoidance is ensured by decomposing the environment
    into convex regions of obstacle-free configuration space and assigning each footstep
    to one such safe region. We demonstrate this technique in simple 2D and 3D environments
    and with real environments sensed by a humanoid robot. We also discuss computational
    performance of the algorithm, which is currently capable of planning short sequences
    of a few steps in under one second or longer sequences of 10-30 footsteps in tens
    of seconds to minutes on common laptop computer hardware. Our implementation is
    available within the Drake MATLAB toolbox.

    by sensory feedback from moving parts of the body. Evidence of this permits resolution

    aids in the identification of this mechanism as a general principle of neural
    organization applicable to all animals with central nervous systems.

  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: 12941-12945
  volume: '107'
  issue: '29'
  abstract: The diversification of life involved enormous increases in size and complexity.
    The evolutionary transitions from prokaryotes to unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans
    were accompanied by major innovations in metabolic design. Here we show that the
    scalings of metabolic rate, population growth rate, and production efficiency
    with body size have changed across the evolutionary transitions. Metabolic rate
    scales with body mass superlinearly in prokaryotes, linearly in protists, and
    sublinearly in metazoans, so Kleiber’s 3/4 power scaling law does not apply universally
    across organisms. The scaling of maximum population growth rate shifts from positive
    in prokaryotes to negative in protists and metazoans, and the efficiency of production
    declines across these groups. Major changes in metabolic processes during the
    early evolution of life overcame existing constraints, exploited new opportunities,
    and imposed new constraints.

  abstract: Minkowski sums cover a wide range of applications in many different fields
    like algebra, morphing, robotics, mechanical CAD/CAM systems ... This paper deals
    with sums of polytopes in a n dimensional space provided that both H-representation
    and V-representation are available i.e. the polytopes are described by both their
    half-spaces and vertices. The first method uses the polytope normal fans and relies
    on the ability to intersect dual polyhedral cones. Then we introduce another way

  abstract: 'Folding and unfolding problems have been implicit since Albrecht D¨ early
    1500’s \[D¨ urer in the ur77\], but have not been studied extensively in the mathematical
    literature until recently. Over the past few years, there has been a surge of
    inter- est in these problems in discrete and computational geometry. This paper
    gives a brief survey of most of the work in this area. Related, shorter surveys
    are given by Demaine \[Dem00\], Demaine and Demaine \[DD01\], and O’Rourke \[O’R98\].
    We are currently preparing a monograph on the topic \[DO05\]. In general, we are
    interested in how objects (such as linkages, pieces of pa- per, and polyhedra)
    can be moved or reconfigured (folded) subject to certain constraints depending
    on the type of object and the problem of interest. Typ- ically the process of
    unfolding approaches a more basic shape, whereas folding complicates the shape.
    We define the configuration space as the set of all config- urations or states
    of the object permitted by the folding constraints, with paths in the space corresponding
    to motions (foldings) of the object. This survey is divided into three sections
    corresponding to the type of object being folded: linkages, paper, or polyhedra.
    Unavoidably, areas with which we are more familiar or for which there is a more
    extensive literature are covered in more detail. For example, more problems have
    been explored in linkage and paper folding than in polyhedron folding, and our
    corresponding sections reflect this imbalance. On the other hand, this survey
    cannot do justice to the wealth of research on protein folding, so only a partial
    survey appears in Section 2.5.'

  container-title: Journal of human evolution
  page: 279-292
  volume: '37'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Knowledge of the forces animals generate and are exposed to during locomotion
    is an important prerequisite for understanding the musculoskeletal correlates
    of locomotor modes. We recorded takeoff and landing forces for 14 animals representing
    seven species of strepsirhine primates with a compliant force pole. Our sample
    included both specialized vertical clingers and leapers and more generalized species.
    Takeoff forces are higher than landing forces. Peak forces during acceleration
    for takeoff ranged from 6 to 12 times body weight, and the peak impact forces
    at landing are between 5 and 9 times body weight. There is a size-related trend
    in peak force magnitudes. Both takeoff and landing forces decrease with increasing
    body size in our sample of animals from 1 kg to over 5 kg. Peak forces increase
    with distance leapt. The distance effect is less clear, probably due to the narrow
    range of distances represented in our sample. A comparison of subadult and adult
    animals of two species of sifakas reveals a tendency for the young animals to
    exert relatively higher peak forces in comparison to their adult conspecifics.
    Finally, Lemur catta and Eulemur rubriventer, the "generalists" in our sample,
    tend to generate higher forces for equal tasks than the specialized vertical clingers
    and leapers (i.e., the indriids and Hapalemur).A broad-scale comparison of peak
    leaping forces and peak forces for quadrupedal and bipedal walking and running
    shows that leaping at small body size is associated with exceptionally high forces.
    Whereas relative forces (i.e., forces divided by body weight) decrease with increasing
    body mass for leaping, forces for walking and running do not change much with
    size. Leaping forces in our sample scale to (mass)(-1/3), which is consistent
    with expectations derived from geometric similarity models. Forces associated
    with other locomotor activities do not appear to follow this pattern. The very
    high forces found in strepsirhine leapers do not seem to be matched by bone robusticity
    beyond that documented for quadrupedal species.

  container-title: American journal of physical anthropology
  page: 348-358
  volume: '128'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Ground reaction forces were recorded for jumps of three individuals each
    of Lemur catta and Eulemur fulvus. Animals jumped back and forth between a ground-mounted
    force plate and a 0.5-m elevated platform, covering horizontal distances of 0.5-2
    m. In total, 190 takeoffs and 263 landings were collected. Animals typically jumped
    from a run up and into a run out, during which they gained or into which they
    carried horizontal impulse. Correspondingly, vertical impulses dominated takeoffs
    and landings. Peak forces were moderate in magnitude and not much higher than
    forces reported for quadrupedal gaits. This is in contrast to the forces for standing
    jumps of specialized leapers that considerably exceed forces associated with quadrupedal
    gaits. Force magnitudes for the lemur jumps are more comparable to peak forces
    reported for other quadrupeds performing running jumps. Takeoffs are characterized
    by higher hindlimb than forelimb peak forces and impulses. L. catta typically
    landed with the hindlimbs making first contact, and the hindlimb forces and impulses
    were higher than the forelimb forces and impulses at landing. E. fulvus typically
    landed with the forelimbs striking first and also bearing the higher forces. This
    pattern does not fully conform to the paradigm of primate limb force distribution,
    with higher hindlimb than forelimb forces. However, the absolute highest forces
    in E. fulvus also occur at the hindlimbs, during acceleration for takeoff.

  publisher: IEEE
  page: 4214-4219
  abstract: We present the results from our work in the development of a robotic arm
    with minimal impedance. The development of such an arm is useful for gentle exploration
    of unknown objects in unstructured environments. Similar to a human, the robotic
    arm should minimize the contact forces in the event of unanticipated contact with
    unknown objects in the absence of visual feedback. To accomplish this, our strategy
    is to develop a good model of the robotic system so that we can use low gains
    which in turn will lead to low impedance and hence low contact forces in manipulation
    tasks in unstructured environments. The paper demonstrates how good modeling and
    feedforward compensation can result in low interaction forces without any external
    force sensing. We present experimental results to demonstrate the validity of
    our model and approach.

  abstract: A dynamic model of a jump glider is presented and correlated with the
    results obtained with a prototype glider. The glider uses a carbon fiber spring
    and a main wing that pivots approximately parallel to the airflow during ascent
    and latches into place for a gliding descent. The robot demonstrates longer traveled
    distance than an equivalent drag-free ballistic mass. A detailed numerical and
    a simplified algebraic model are also introduced, which are useful for exploring
    design tradeoffs and performance. These models suggest ways to improve the traveled
    distance and indicate that with modest variations in the wing angle of attack
    during ascent, one can choose from a variety of launch angles to accommodate variations
    in ground friction without greatly compromising range.

  abstract: We have built an anatomically correct testbed (ACT) hand with the purpose
    of understanding the intrinsic biomechanical and control features in human hands
    that are critical for achieving robust, versatile, and dexterous movements, as
    well as rich object and world exploration. By mimicking the underlying mechanics
    and controls of the human hand in a hardware platform, our goal is to achieve
    previously unmatched grasping and manipulation skills. In this paper, the novel
    constituting mechanisms, unique muscle to joint relationships, and movement demonstrations
    of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and wrist of the ACT Hand are presented.
    The grasping and manipulation abilities of the ACT Hand are also illustrated.
    The fully functional ACT Hand platform allows for the possibility to design and
    experiment with novel control algorithms leading to a deeper understanding of
    human dexterity.

    of a batoid-inspired oscillating fin</span>
  container-title: Journal of Fluid Mechanics
  page: 245-266
  volume: '691'
  abstract: A mechanical representation of batoid-like propulsion using a flexible
    fin with an elliptical planform shape is used to study the hydrodynamics of undulatory
    propulsion. The wake is found to consist of a series of interconnected vortex
    rings, whereby leading and trailing edge vortices of subsequent cycles become
    entangled with one another. Efficient propulsion is achieved when leading and
    trailing edge vortices coalesce at the spanwise location where most of the streamwise
    fluid momentum is concentrated in the wake of the fin. Both the Strouhal number
    and the wavelength are found to have a significant effect on the wake structure.
    In general, a decrease in wavelength promotes a wake transition from shedding
    a single vortex per half-oscillation period to shedding a pair of vortices per
    half-oscillation period. An increase in Strouhal number causes the wake to bifurcate
    a finite distance downstream of the trailing edge of the fin into a pair of jets
    oriented at an acute angle to the line of symmetry. The bifurcation distance decreases
    with increasing Strouhal number and wavelength, and it is shown to obey a simple

    deformation in the little skate, Leucoraja erinacea</span>'
  container-title: The Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 705-712
  volume: '220'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Most batoids have a unique swimming mode in which thrust is generated
    by either oscillating or undulating expanded pectoral fins that form a disc. Only
    one previous study of the freshwater stingray has quantified three-dimensional
    motions of the wing, and no comparable data are available for marine batoid species
    that may differ considerably in their mode of locomotion. Here, we investigate
    three-dimensional kinematics of the pectoral wing of the little skate, Leucoraja
    erinacea, swimming steadily at two speeds \[1 and 2 body lengths (BL) s(-1)\].
    We measured the motion of nine points in three dimensions during wing oscillation
    and determined that there are significant differences in movement amplitude among
    wing locations, as well as significant differences as speed increases in body
    angle, wing beat frequency and speed of the traveling wave on the wing. In addition,
    we analyzed differences in wing curvature with swimming speed. At 1 BL s(-1),
    the pectoral wing is convex in shape during the downstroke along the medio-lateral
    fin midline, but at 2 BL s(-1) the pectoral fin at this location cups into the
    flow, indicating active curvature control and fin stiffening. Wing kinematics
    of the little skate differed considerably from previous work on the freshwater
    stingray, which does not show active cupping of the whole fin on the downstroke.

  container-title: The Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 1804-1807
  volume: '219'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: 2016\. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.We quantify the oxygen
    consumption rates and cost of transport (COT) of a benthic batoid fish, the little
    skate, Leucoraja erinacea, at three swimming speeds. We report that this species
    has the lowest mass-adjusted swimming metabolic rate measured for any elasmobranch;
    however, this species incurs a much higher COT at approximately five times the
    lowest values recorded for some teleosts. In addition, because skates lack a propulsive
    caudal fin and could not sustain steady swimming beyond a relatively low optimum
    speed of 1.25 body lengths s-1, we propose that the locomotor efficiency of benthic
    rajiform fishes is limited to the descending portion of a single COT-speed relationship.
    This renders these species poorly suited for long-distance translocation and,
    therefore, especially vulnerable to regional-scale environmental disturbances.

  abstract: 'Folding a sheet of paper along a curve can lead to structures seen in
    decorative art and utilitarian packing boxes. Here we present a theory for the
    simplest such structure: an annular circular strip that is folded along a central
    circular curve to form a three-dimensional buckled structure driven by geometrical
    frustration. We quantify this shape in terms of the radius of the circle, the
    dihedral angle of the fold and the mechanical properties of the sheet of paper
    and the fold itself. When the sheet is isometrically deformed everywhere except
    along the fold itself, stiff folds result in creases with constant curvature and
    oscillatory torsion. However, relatively softer folds inherit the broken symmetry
    of the buckled shape with oscillatory curvature and torsion. Our asymptotic analysis
    of the isometrically deformed state is corroborated by numerical simulations which
    allow us to generalize our analysis to study multiply folded structures.'

  abstract: Recent advances in integrative studies of locomotion have revealed several
    general principles. Energy storage and exchange mechanisms discovered in walking
    and running bipeds apply to multilegged locomotion and even to flying and swimming.
    Nonpropulsive lateral forces can be sizable, but they may benefit stability, maneuverability,
    or other criteria that become apparent in natural environments. Locomotor control
    systems combine rapid mechanical preflexes with multimodal sensory feedback and
    feedforward commands. Muscles have a surprising variety of functions in locomotion,
    serving as motors, brakes, springs, and struts. Integrative approaches reveal
    not only how each component within a locomotor system operates but how they function
    as a collective whole.

    spring engagement in an ankle exoskeleton. The clutch is based on electrostatic
    adhesion between thin electrode sheets coated with a dielectric material. Each
    electrode pair weighs 1.5 g, bears up to 100 N, and changes states in less than
    30 ms. We placed clutches in series with elastomer springs to allow control of
    spring engagement, and placed several clutched springs in parallel to discretely
    adjust stiffness. By engaging different numbers of springs, the system produced
    six different levels of stiffness. Force at peak displacement ranged from 14 to
    501 N, and the device returned 95

  page: 978-983
  abstract: In this paper we discuss the potential of applying our concept for a robotic
    hand fabricated via Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) as a prosthetic terminal
    device. Experimental results with the hand have shown a level of robustness, adaptability,
    and other performance properties as yet unseen in a robotic hand. Besides reliable
    performance, the hand is durable, is produced using a molding process that allows
    both for inexpensive mass production as well as a realistic appearance without
    the need for a cosmetic glove, and incorporates a simple design that requires
    only a single actuator for the eight active degrees of freedom. All of these factors
    make it a good candidate as a basis for either a body-powered or externally-powered
    prosthetic terminal device that is realistic, functional, robust, and inexpensive.

    torque oscillations in curve walking of two crayfish species</span>
  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 3069-3080
  volume: '202'
  issue: '22'
  abstract: Curve walking in two species of crayfish, Procambarus clarkii and Astacus
    leptodactylus, was investigated to test whether the mechanism underlying curve
    walking is the synchronous action of a centrally pre-programmed leg tripod or
    whether it is the action of one principal leg that produces the main body yaw
    torque. Curve walking was induced by an optomotor visual stimulus, and the yaw
    torque produced by the tethered animals was measured in open-loop conditions.
    Our main results suggest that the yaw torque oscillations in both P. clarkii and
    A. leptodactylus are related to the movement of outer leg 4 (i.e. leg 4 on the
    outside of the turn). That is, the peaks in the yaw torque occur, on average,
    in synchrony with the power stroke of outer leg 4. When comparing the results
    of this open-loop experiment on P. clarkii with results previously obtained for
    curve walking in untethered individuals of the same species, we found a much higher
    variability in leg coordination in the open-loop situation. Similarly, here we
    did not find the same level of synchrony in the tripod (formed by outer leg 4
    and inner legs 2 and 5) observed during untethered free walking. Therefore, we
    suggest that tethered conditions may diminish the need for stability and thus
    allow outer leg 4 to produce a body rotation regardless of the leg stepping configuration.
    The characteristics of leg 4 are in line with its major role in turning. According
    to previous studies, legs 4 provide the largest force and the largest step amplitude
    during walking, and their force includes both a pulling and a pushing component
    which can facilitate the control of turning. Although it is apparent that outer
    leg 4 is not the only leg that can produce an inward yaw torque, its major role
    in modulating the yaw torque suggests that there may be a specific, centrally
    generated control of outer leg 4 during curve walking in crayfish.

  title: An Untethered, Electrostatic, Globally Controllable MEMS Micro-Robot
  container-title: Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems
  page: 1-15
  volume: '15'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: We present an untethered, electrostatic, MEMS micro-robot, with dimensions
    of 60 &mu;m by 250 &mu;m by 10 &mu;m. The device consists of a curved, cantilevered
    steering arm, mounted on an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA). These two
    components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon,
    and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with
    an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power
    and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their
    position on the substrate. Individual control of the component actuators provides
    two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full
    coverage of a planar workspace. These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error
    of less than 3.7&deg;/mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176
    &mu;m, and achieve speeds of over 200 &mu;m/sec with an average step size as small
    as 12 nm. They have been shown to operate open-loop for distances exceeding 35
    cm without failure, and can be controlled through teleoperation to navigate complex
    paths. The devices were fabricated through a multiuser surface micromachining
    process, and were postprocessed to add a patterned layer of tensile chromium,
    which curls the steering arms upward. After sacrificial release, the devices were
    transferred with a vacuum microprobe to the electrical grid for testing. This
    grid consists of a silicon substrate coated with 13-&mu;m microfabricated electrodes,
    arranged in an interdigitated fashion with 2-&mu;m spaces. The electrodes are
    insulated by a layer of electron-beam-evaporated zirconium dioxide, so that devices
    placed on top of the electrodes will experience an electrostatic force in response
    to an applied voltage. Control waveforms are broadcast to the device through the
    capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response of
    the device body. Hysteresis in the system allows on-board storage of n=2 bits
    of state information in response to these electrical signals. The presence of
    on-board state information within the device itself allows each of the two device
    subsystems (USDA and steering arm) to be individually addressed and controlled-
    . We describe this communication and control strategy and show necessary and sufficient
    conditions for voltage-selective actuation of all 2n system states, both for our
    devices (n=2), and for the more general case (where n is larger.).

  abstract: Evolutionary robotics applies the selection, variation, and heredity principles
    of natural evo-lution to the design of robots with embodied intelligence. It can
    be considered as a subfield of robotics that aims to create more robust and adaptive
    robots. A pivotal feature of the evo-lutionary approach is that it considers the
    whole robot at once, and enables the exploitation of robot features in a holistic
    manner. Evolutionary robotics can also be seen as an innova-tive approach to the
    study of evolution based on a new kind of experimentalism. The use of robots as
    a substrate can help to address questions that are difficult, if not impossible,
    to investigate through computer simulations or biological studies. In this paper,
    we consider the main achievements of evolutionary robotics, focusing particularly
    on its contributions to both engineering and biology. We briefly elaborate on
    methodological issues, review some of the most interesting findings, and discuss
    important open issues and promising avenues for future work.

  abstract: Planning locomotion trajectories for legged microrobots is challenging
    because of their complex morphology, high frequency passive dynamics, and discontinuous
    contact interactions with their environment. Consequently, such research is often
    driven by time-consuming experimental methods. As an alternative, we present a
    framework for systematically modeling, planning, and controlling legged microrobots.
    We develop a three-dimensional dynamic model of a 1.5 gram quadrupedal microrobot
    with complexity (e.g., number of degrees of freedom) similar to larger-scale legged
    robots. We then adapt a recently developed variational contact-implicit trajectory
    optimization method to generate feasible whole-body locomotion plans for this
    microrobot, and we demonstrate that these plans can be tracked with simple joint-space
    controllers. We plan and execute periodic gaits at multiple stride frequencies
    and on various surfaces. These gaits achieve high per-cycle velocities, including
    a maximum of 10.87 mm/cycle, which is 15

  abstract: 2017 IEEE. We present an off-board phase estimator and controller for
    leg position near the resonance of the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot’s (HAMR)
    two degree-of-freedom transmission. This control system is a first step towards
    leveraging the significant increase in stride length at transmission resonance
    for faster and more efficient locomotion. We experimentally characterize HAMR’s
    transmission and determine that actuator phase is a sufficient proxy for leg phase
    across the range of useful operating frequencies (1-120Hz). An estimator is developed
    to determine actuator phase using off-board position sensors and it converges
    within a cycle on average. We also fit a nonlinear dynamic model of the transmission
    to the experimental data, and utilize the model to determine a suitable open-loop
    resonant leg trajectory and define feed forward control inputs. This resonant
    (100Hz) trajectory is theoretically 50

  publisher: Elsevier Ltd
  page: 3-13
  volume: '60'
  abstract: We present a bitmap printing method and digital workflow using multi-material
    high resolution Additive Manufacturing (AM). Material composition is defined based
    on voxel resolution and used to fabricate a design object with locally varying
    material stiffness, aiming to satisfy the design objective. In this workflow voxel
    resolution is set by the printer’s native resolution, eliminating the need for
    slicing and path planning. Controlling geometry and material property variation
    at the resolution of the printer provides significantly greater control over structure-property-function
    relationships. To demonstrate the utility of the bitmap printing approach we apply
    it to the design of a customized prosthetic socket. Pressure-sensing elements
    are concurrently fabricated with the socket, providing possibilities for evaluation
    of the socket’s fit. The level of control demonstrated in this study cannot be
    achieved using traditional CAD tools and volume-based AM workflows, implying that
    new CAD workflows must be developed in order to enable designers to harvest the
    capabilities of AM.

  abstract: DNA nanotechnology exploits the programmable specificity afforded by base-pairing
    to produce self-assembling macromolecular objects of custom shape. For building
    megadalton-scale DNA nanostructures, a long ’scaffold’ strand can be employed
    to template the assembly of hundreds of oligonucleotide ’staple’ strands into
    a planar antiparallel array of cross-linked helices. We recently adapted this
    ’scaffolded DNA origami’ method to producing 3D shapes formed as pleated layers
    of double helices constrained to a honeycomb lattice. However, completing the
    required design steps can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Here we present caDNAno,
    an open-source software package with a graphical user interface that aids in the
    design of DNA sequences for folding 3D honeycomb-pleated shapes A series of rectangular-block
    motifs were designed, assembled, and analyzed to identify a well-behaved motif
    that could serve as a building block for future studies. The use of caDNAno significantly
    reduces the effort required to design 3D DNA-origami structures. The software
    is available at http://cadnano.org/, along with example designs and video tutorials
    demonstrating their construction. The source code is released under the MIT license.

  container-title: Nature
  page: 414-8
  volume: '459'
  issue: '7245'
  abstract: Molecular self-assembly offers a ’bottom-up’ route to fabrication with
    subnanometre precision of complex structures from simple components. DNA has proved
    to be a versatile building block for programmable construction of such objects,
    including two-dimensional crystals, nanotubes, and three-dimensional wireframe
    nanopolyhedra. Templated self-assembly of DNA into custom two-dimensional shapes
    on the megadalton scale has been demonstrated previously with a multiple-kilobase
    ’scaffold strand’ that is folded into a flat array of antiparallel helices by
    interactions with hundreds of oligonucleotide ’staple strands’. Here we extend
    this method to building custom three-dimensional shapes formed as pleated layers
    of helices constrained to a honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate the design and assembly
    of nanostructures approximating six shapes-monolith, square nut, railed bridge,
    genie bottle, stacked cross, slotted cross-with precisely controlled dimensions
    ranging from 10 to 100 nm. We also show hierarchical assembly of structures such
    as homomultimeric linear tracks and heterotrimeric wireframe icosahedra. Proper
    assembly requires week-long folding times and calibrated monovalent and divalent
    cation concentrations. We anticipate that our strategy for self-assembling custom
    three-dimensional shapes will provide a general route to the manufacture of sophisticated
    devices bearing features on the nanometre scale.

  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 813-826
  volume: '206'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Salmonid fishes (trout, salmon and relatives) have served as a model system
    for study of the mechanics of aquatic animal locomotion, yet little is known about
    the function of non-axial propulsors in this major taxonomic group. In this study
    we examine the behavioral and hydromechanical repertoire of the paired pectoral
    fins of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, performing both steady rectilinear
    swimming and unsteady maneuvering locomotion. A combination of kinematic analysis
    and quantitative flow visualization (using digital particle image velocimetry)
    enables identification of the propulsive roles played by pectoral fin motions.
    During constant-speed swimming (0.5 and 1.0 body length s–1), the pectoral fins
    remain adducted against the body. These fins are actively recruited, however,
    for a variety of maneuvering behaviors, including station holding in still water
    (hovering), low-speed (i.e. non-fast-start) turning, and rapid deceleration of
    the body during braking. Despite having a shallow pectoral-fin base orientation
    (the plesiomorphic teleost condition), trout are capable of rotating the fin base
    over 30° during maneuvering, which affords the fin an impressive degree of kinematic
    versatility. When hovering, the pectoral fins are depressed$\$r$\$nbeneath the
    body and twisted along their long axes to allow anteroposterior sculling. During
    turning and braking, the fins undergo spanwise rotation in the opposite direction
    and exhibit mediolateral and dorsoventral excursions. Water velocity fields and
    calculated momentum flows in the wake of the pectoral fins reveal that positive
    thrust is not generated during maneuvering, except during the retraction half-stroke
    of hovering. Relatively large laterally directed fluid force (mean 2.7mN) is developed
    during turning, whose reaction powers yawing rotation of the body (4–41 ° s–1).
    During deceleration, the wake-force line of action falls below the center of mass
    of the body, and this result supports a long- standing mechanical model of braking
    by fishes with ventrally positioned paired fins. Despite its traditional categorization
    as a propulsor of limited functional importance, the salmoniform pectoral fin
    exhibits a diverse locomotor repertoire comparable to that of higher teleostean
    fishes.

  abstract: Quantifying the locomotor forces experienced by swimming fishes represents
    a significant challenge because direct measurements of force applied to the aquatic
    medium are not feasible. However, using the technique of digital particle image
    velocimetry (DPIV), it is possible to quantify the effect of fish fins on water
    movement and hence to estimate momentum transfer from the animal to the fluid.
    We used DPIV to visualize water flow in the wake of the pectoral fins of bluegill
    sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) swimming at speeds of 0.5-1.5 L s-1, where L is
    total body length. Velocity fields quantified in three perpendicular planes in
    the wake of the fins allowed three-dimensional reconstruction of downstream vortex
    structures. At low swimming speed (0.5 L s-1), vorticity is shed by each fin during
    the downstroke and stroke reversal to generate discrete, roughly symmetrical,
    vortex rings of near-uniform circulation with a central jet of high-velocity flow.
    At and above the maximum sustainable labriform swimming speed of 1.0 L s-1, additional
    vorticity appears on the upstroke, indicating the production of linked pairs of
    rings by each fin. Fluid velocity measured in the vicinity of the fin indicates
    that substantial spanwise flow during the downstroke may occur as vortex rings
    are formed. The forces exerted by the fins on the water in three dimensions were
    calculated from vortex ring orientation and momentum. Mean wake-derived thrust
    (11.1 mN) and lift (3.2 mN) forces produced by both fins per stride at 0.5 L s-1
    were found to match closely empirically determined counter-forces of body drag
    and weight. Medially directed reaction forces were unexpectedly large, averaging

    Drumwright, Evan )
  abstract: Two methods have been used extensively to model resting contact for rigid
    body simulation. The first approach, the penalty method, applies virtual springs
    to surfaces in contact to minimize interpenetration. This method, as typically
    implemented, results in oscillatory behavior and considerable penetration. The
    second approach, based on formulating resting contact as a linear complementarity
    problem, determines the resting contact forces analytically to prevent interpenetration.
    The analytical method exhibits expected-case polynomial complexity in the number
    of contact points, and may fail to find a solution in polynomial time when friction
    is modeled. We present a fast penalty method that minimizes oscillatory behavior
    and leads to little penetration during resting contact; our method compares favorably
    to the analytical method with regard to these two measures, while exhibiting much
    faster performance both asymptotically and empirically.

  page: 797-806
  volume: '15'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: In subterranean species where excavation is energetically expensive, efficient
    spatial navigation is vital to reducing the costs of locating important resources
    such as food and mates. While spatial navigational ability is positively correlated
    with sociality in subterranean mammals, we have a less clear understanding of
    the role of habitat complexity on navigational ability. We tested spatial navigational
    ability and memory in 12-18-month captive Natal mole-rats (Cryptomys hottentotus
    natalensis) maintained in a simple environment with no environmental enrichment
    and newly captured wild individuals from natural, complex burrow systems. In maze
    trials, mole-rats captured freshly from the wild made significantly fewer navigational
    errors, were more likely to successfully navigate the maze, travelled shorter
    distances and as a consequence, completed the maze in less time. Male mole-rats
    from both experimental treatments were more likely to complete the maze than females.
    Memory retention of the maze was tested on day two, seven, 30 and 60, respectively.
    The results were variable, although both groups showed a significant memory retention
    60 days after testing. Our results highlight the potential importance of the environment
    (microhabitat complexity) on spatial cognitive performance in mole-rats.

  abstract: 'Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is the process of 3D printing objects
    from melted plastic filament. The hot plastic exits a nozzle and fuses with the
    part just below, adding a layer of material to the object being formed. However,
    filament can only be deposited on top of an existing surface. Therefore, overhangs
    require a disposable support structure to be printed, temporarily supporting the
    threads of plastic that would otherwise hang in empty space. Existing techniques
    for support generation fall into two categories: The first allow for very reliable
    prints by enclosing the bottom of the object in a dense structure, at the expense
    of increased material usage and build times. The second generate thin hierarchical
    structures connecting to the surface in a sparse number of points. This uses less
    material, at the expense of reliability: the part might become unstable, the structure
    itself may become difficult to print, the bottom surface quality degrades. The
    user therefore has to correct the structure and its parameters for each new object.
    We propose to exploit the ability of FFF printers to print bridges across gaps.
    Since bridges are always supported by pillars at their extremities, they are both
    stronger and more stable than hierarchical tree structures. Our technique first
    selects the points to support based on overhang and part stability during the
    entire print process. It then optimizes for a printable scaffolding composed of
    bridges and vertical pillars, supporting all points. The result is an automated
    support generation technique using little material while ensuring fine surface
    quality and stability during the printing process.'

  page: 3982-3987
  abstract: In this paper, we present a new method for the control of soft robots
    with elastic behavior, piloted by several actuators. The central contribution
    of this work is the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM), computed in real-time,
    in the control algorithm. The FEM based simulation computes the nonlinear deformations
    of the robots at interactive rates. The model is completed by Lagrange multipliers
    at the actuation zones and at the end-effector position. A reduced compliance
    matrix is built in order to deal with the necessary inversion of the model. Then,
    an iterative algorithm uses this compliance matrix to find the contribution of
    the actuators (force and/or position) that will deform the structure so that the
    terminal end of the robot follows a given position. Additional constraints, like
    rigid or deformable obstacles, or the internal characteristics of the actuators
    are integrated in the control algorithm. We illustrate our method using simulated
    examples of both serial and parallel structures and we validate it on a real 3D
    soft robot made of silicone.

  abstract: Robot manipulation tasks in unknown and unstructured environments can
    often be better addressed with hands that are capable of force-sensing and passive
    compliance. We describe the design of a compact four degree-of-freedom (DOF) hand
    that exhibits these properties. This hand is being developed for a new humanoid
    robot platform. Our hand contains four modular Force Sensing Compliant (FSC) actuators
    acting on three fingers. One actuator controls the spread between two fingers.
    Three actuators independently control the top knuckle of each finger. The lower
    knuckles of the finger are passively coupled to the top knuckle. We place a pair
    of torsion springs between the motor housing and the hand chassis. By measuring
    the deflection of these springs, we can determine the acting force of the actuator.
    The springs also provide compliance in the finger and protect the motor gearbox
    from high impact shocks. Our novel actuators, combined with embedded control electronics,
    allow for a compact and dexterous hand design that is well suited to humanoid
    manipulation research. 1

  abstract: The pseudo-rigid-body model concept allows compliant mechanisms to be
    analyzed using well-known rigid-body kinematics. This paper presents a pseudo-rigid-body
    model for initially curved pinned-pinned segments that undergo large, nonlinear
    deflections. The model approximates the segment as three rigid members joined
    by pin joints. Torsional springs placed at the joints model the segment’s stiffness.
    This model has been validated by fabricating several such segments from a variety
    of different materials. Testing of the force-deflection behavior of these segments
    verified the accuracy of the model.

  abstract: Understanding the prevalence of disability is important for public health
    programs to be able to address the needs of persons with disabilities. Beginning
    in 2013, to measure disability prevalence by functional type, the Behavioral Risk
    Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), added five questions to identify disability
    in vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent living. CDC analyzed
    data from the 2013 BRFSS to assess overall prevalence of any disability, as well
    as specific types of disability among noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. Across
    all states, disabilities in mobility and cognition were the most frequently reported
    types. State-level prevalence of each disability type ranged from 2.7

    Sciences
  page: 115-144
  volume: '305'
  issue: '1122'
  abstract: A full derivation is presented for the vortex theory of hovering flight
    outlined in preliminary reports. The theory relates the lift produced by flapping
    wings to the induced velocity and power of the wake. Suitable forms of the momentum
    theory are combined with the vortex approach to reduce the mathematical complexity
    as much as possible. Vorticity is continuously shed from the wings in sympathy
    with changes in wing circulation. The vortex sheet shed during a half-stroke convects
    downwards with the induced velocity field, and should be approximately planar
    at the end of a half-stroke. Vorticity within the sheet will roll up into complicated
    vortex rings, but the rate of this process is unknown. The exact state of the
    sheet is not crucial to the theory, however, since the impulse and energy of the
    vortex sheet do not change as it rolls up, and the theory is derived on the assumption
    that the extent of roll-up is negligible. The force impulse required to generate
    the sheet is derived from the vorticity of the sheet, and the mean wing lift is
    equal to that impulse divided by the period of generation. This method of calculating
    the mean lift is suitable for unsteady aerodynamic lift mechanisms as well as
    the quasi-steady mechanism. The relation between the mean lift and the impulse
    of the resulting vortex sheet is used to develop a conceptual artifice - a pulsed
    actuator disc - that approximates closely the net effect of the complicated lift
    forces produced in hovering. T he disc periodically applies a pressure impulse
    over some defined area, and is a generalized form of the Froude actuator disc
    from propeller theory. The pulsed disc provides a convenient link between circulatory
    lift and the powerful momentum and vortex analyses of the wake. The induced velocity
    and power of the wake are derived in stages, starting with the simple Rankine-Froude
    theory for the wake produced by a Froude disc applying a uniform, continuous pressure
    to the air. The wake model is then improved by considering a ‘modified’ Froude
    disc exerting a continuous, but non-uniform pressure. This step provides a spatial
    correction factor for the Rankine-Froude theory, by taking into account variations
    in pressure and circulation over the disc area. Finally, the wake produced by
    a pulsed Froude disc is analysed, and a temporal correction factor is derived
    for the periodic application of spatially uniform pressures. Both correction factors
    are generally small, and can be treated as independent perturbations of the Rankine-Froude
    model. Thus the corrections can be added linearly to obtain the total correction
    for the general case of a pulsed actuator disc with spatial and temporal pressure
    variations. The theory is compared with Rayner’s vortex theory for hovering flight.
    Under identical test conditions, numerical results from the two theories agree
    to within 3

  container-title: Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology
  page: 283-296
  volume: '26'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: The nature of manual manipulation of objects is discussed. It is argued
    that a functional distinction should be made between palmar grips which immobilise
    an object in the hand, and digital patterns which permit manipulation. Such a
    distinction is separate from any anatomically defined power and precision configurations.
    Manipulative hand movements may be grouped into three classes, based on differences
    between sequenced patterns of movement and synergies, the latter being further
    subdivided into simple and reciprocal patterns. Within each of the three classes,
    a number of individual movement patterns are described. These differ mainly in
    the number of digits involved and the way in which the thumb is employed. The
    classification is concerned with movements of the digits directed at manipulating
    an object within the hand. It is not concerned with movements of the hand as a
    whole, using the wrist or more proximal joints, while holding an immobilised object.

  abstract: Shape change is a prevalent function apparent in a diverse set of natural
    structures, including seed dispersal units, climbing plants and carnivorous plants.
    Many of these natural materials change shape by using cellulose microfibrils at
    specific orientations to anisotropically restrict the swelling/shrinkage of their
    organic matrices upon external stimuli. This is in contrast to the material-specific
    mechanisms found in synthetic shape-memory systems. Here we propose a robust and
    universal method to replicate this unusual shape-changing mechanism of natural
    systems in artificial bioinspired composites. The technique is based upon the
    remote control of the orientation of reinforcing inorganic particles within the
    composite using a weak external magnetic field. Combining this reinforcement orientational
    control with swellable/shrinkable polymer matrices enables the creation of composites
    whose shape change can be programmed into the material’s microstructure rather
    than externally imposed. Such bioinspired approach can generate composites with
    unusual reversibility, twisting effects and site-specific programmable shape changes.

  abstract: Laboratory and field data show that the digging habits of ants and the
    resulting nest architecture varywith soil conditions, yet, the geomechanical understanding
    of ant tun- neling is lacking.We study the excavation strategies used by harvester
    ants in clay, silt, sand, and gravel at water contents that range from dry to
    saturated. The study focuses on the conditions at the tunnel face that determine
    particle removal methods, digging rate, the development of branches, and tun-
    neling patterns. Analytical and numerical models provide particle-level insight
    into the experimental observations and help identify the causal links that relate
    ants digging perfor- mance and nest geometric patterns with the properties of
    the granular medium such as grain size, moisture, and packing density. Results
    highlight ants’ exceptional ability to sense the prevailing geomechanical conditions
    in tunnels, and to adapt excavation strategies, transportmethods and tunneling
    patterns to those conditions, within their inherent size and strength limitations.
    The resulting tunnel structure emerges as a mechanically-convenient and energy-efficient
    topology based on local information gather by ants along the tunnel and at the
    tunnel face.

  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 56-67
  volume: '215'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'We designed a robotic fish caudal fin with six individually moveable
    fin rays based on the tail of the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Previous
    fish robotic tail designs have loosely resembled the caudal fin of fishes, but
    have not incorporated key biomechanical components such as fin rays that can be
    controlled to generate complex tail conformations and motion programs similar
    to those seen in the locomotor repertoire of live fishes. We used this robotic
    caudal fin to test for the effects of fin ray stiffness, frequency and motion
    program on the generation of thrust and lift forces. Five different sets of fin
    rays were constructed to be from 150 to 2000 times the stiffness of biological
    fin rays, appropriately scaled for the robotic caudal fin, which had linear dimensions
    approximately four times larger than those of adult bluegill sunfish. Five caudal
    fin motion programs were identified as kinematic features of swimming behaviors
    in live bluegill sunfish, and were used to program the kinematic repertoire: flat
    movement of the entire fin, cupping of the fin, W-shaped fin motion, fin undulation
    and rolling movements. The robotic fin was flapped at frequencies ranging from
    0.5 to 2.4 Hz. All fin motions produced force in the thrust direction, and the
    cupping motion produced the most thrust in almost all cases. Only the undulatory
    motion produced lift force of similar magnitude to the thrust force. More compliant
    fin rays produced lower peak magnitude forces than the stiffer fin rays at the
    same frequency. Thrust and lift forces increased with increasing flapping frequency;
    thrust was maximized by the 500× stiffness fin rays and lift was maximized by
    the 1000× stiffness fin rays.'

  volume: '205'

  abstract: Leaping, parachuting and gliding are the primary means by which arboreal
    squirrels negotiate gaps in the canopy. There are notable differences among the
    three locomotor modes with respect to mid-air postures and aerodynamics, yet it
    is unclear whether variation should also be expected during the launch phase of
    locomotion. To address this question, launch kinematic profiles were compared
    in leaping (Tamias striatus), parachuting (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and gliding
    (Glaucomys volans) squirrels. Animals were filmed launching to the ground from
    a platform using high-speed video. Statistical comparisons among taxa indicated
    that only six out of 23 variables were significantly different among the three
    species. Two were associated with tail kinematics and were a consequence of tail
    morphology. Two were forelimb-related and discriminated gliding from non-gliding
    taxa. The remaining two variables were performance attributes, indicating significant
    variation among the species in take-off velocity and horizontal range. The absence
    of significant differences in hindlimb kinematics indicates that propulsion is
    essentially identical in leaping, parachuting and gliding squirrels.

    flat surfaces from a ballistic trajectory and (2) successfully transitioning to
    a climbing gait. Merging these two modes of movement is achieved via a mechanism
    utilizing an opposed grip with directional adhesives. Critical design considerations
    include (a) climbing mechanism weight constraints, (b) suitable body geometry
    for climbing and (c) effects of impact dynamics. The robot uses a symmetric linkage
    and cam mechanism to load and detach the feet while climbing. The lengths of key
    parameters, including the distances between each the feet and the tail, are chosen
    based on the ratio of required preload force and detachment force for the adhesive
    mechanism.

  abstract: Rapid prototyping systems are controlled by a computer which uses the
    CAD representation to build parts accord- ing to an additive plane layering process.
    The computer controls a laser beam or a print head, or any process that leads
    to the formation of a slice of a part using resins, powders, paper, wax or other
    materials. The original CAD representation is translated into commands to drive
    the process, and accuracy issues will make or break these emerging technologies.
    It is therefore important to understand where the errors stem from, what are the
    issues associated with the software representation formats, and how to minimize
    or eliminate these errors. Presents a summary of CAD to RP software formats, and
    explains the accuracy issues associated with the selected representation. Discusses
    improvements that can be obtained by process modifications.

  container-title: The Journal of experimental biology
  page: 71-86
  volume: '185'
  abstract: 'Trotting and hopping animals use muscles, tendons and ligaments to store
    and return elastic energy as they bounce along the ground. We examine how the
    musculoskeletal spring system operates at different speeds and in animals of different
    sizes. We model trotting and hopping as a simple spring-mass system which consists
    of a leg spring and a mass. We find that the stiffness of the leg spring (k(leg))
    is nearly independent of speed in dogs, goats, horses and red kangaroos. As these
    animals trot or hop faster, the leg spring sweeps a greater angle during the stance
    phase, and the vertical excursion of the center of mass during the ground contact
    phase decreases. The combination of these changes to the spring system causes
    animals to bounce off the ground more quickly at higher speeds. Analysis of a
    wide size range of animals (0.1-140 kg) at equivalent speeds reveals that larger
    animals have stiffer leg springs (k(leg) \[symbol: see text\] M0.67, where M is
    body mass), but that the angle swept by the leg spring is nearly independent of
    body mass. As a result, the resonant period of vertical vibration of the spring-mass
    system is longer in larger animals. The length of time that the feet are in contact
    with the ground increases with body mass in nearly the same way as the resonant
    period of vertical vibration.'

  abstract: Lizards bend their trunks laterally with each step of locomotion and,
    as a result, their locomotion appears to be fundamentally different from mammalian
    locomotion. The goal of the present study was to determine whether lizards use
    the same two basic gaits as other legged animals or whether they use a mechanically
    unique gait due to lateral trunk bending. Force platform and kinematic measurements
    revealed that two species of lizards, Coleonyx variegatus and Eumeces skiltonianus,
    used two basic gaits similar to mammalian walking and trotting gaits. In both
    gaits, the kinetic energy fluctuations due to lateral movements of the center
    of mass were less than 5

  container-title: IEEE international conference on robotics and automation
  page: 3217-3223
  volume: '4'
  abstract: We demonstrate the robust execution of two regrasping primitives, rotation
    and pivoting on a four-fingered hand, based on the real-time sensors data based
    control. We indicate frequently occurring grasp errors and faults during execution
    of the two regrasping primitives. The sensors data is obtained from two sources.
    One is force-torque sensors mounted on the finger tips of the four fingers. The
    other is a laser range sensor mounted on the palm of the hand. The grasp information
    acquired through these two sources is useful for both sensing the errors and controlling
    the fingers. The paper proposes strategies to recover or prevent faulty grasps
    during manipulation, which may lead to unwanted object movements or grasp failures.
    The object to be manipulated is a polygonal prism, the model of whichis known
    a priori.

  abstract: In the Cobotic Hand Controller, we have introduced an admittance display
    that can render very high impedances (up to its own structural stiffness). This
    is due to its use of infinitely variable transmissions. While admittance displays
    typically excel at rendering high impedances, the incorporation of infinitely
    variable transmissions in the Cobotic Hand Controller allows the stable display
    of a wide dynamic range, including low impedances. The existence of a display
    that excels at rendering high-impedance constraints, but has high-fidelity control
    of low impedances tangent to those constraints, has led us to describe an admittance
    control architecture not often examined in the haptics community. In this paper,
    we develop a comprehensive approach that enables rendering of rigid motion constraints
    while simultaneously preserving the physical integrity of the intended inertial
    dynamics tangent to those constraints. This is in contrast to conventional impedance-control
    algorithms that focus primarily on rendering reaction forces along contact normals
    with constraints. We present this algorithm here, which is general to all admittance
    displays, and report on its implementation with the Cobotic Hand Controller. We
    offer examples of rigid bodies and linkages subject to holonomic and/or nonholonomic
    constraints

  abstract: Flapping wings provide unmatched maneuverability for flying micro-robots.
    Recent advances in modelling insect aerodynamics show that adequate wing rotation
    at the end of the stroke is essential for generating adequate flight forces. We
    developed a thorax structure using four bar frames combined with an extensible
    fan-fold wing to provide adequate wing stroke and rotation. Flow measurements
    on a scale model of the beating wing show promising aerodynamics. Calculations
    using a simple resonant mechanical circuit model show that piezoelectric actuators
    can generate sufficient power, force and stroke to drive the wings at 150

  page: 13-30
  volume: '2'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: This paper describes a new method for calculating the acceleration of
    a robot in response to given actuator forces. The method is applicable to open-loop
    kinematic chains containing revolute and prismatic joints. The algorithm is based
    on recursive formulas involving quantities called articulated-body inertias, which
    represent the inertia properties of collections of rigid bodies connected together
    by joints allowing constrained relative motion between the bodies. A new, matrix-based
    notation is introduced to represent articulated-body inertias and other spatial
    quantities. This notation is used to develop the algorithm, and results in a compact
    representation of the equations. The new algorithm has a computational requirement
    that varies linearly with the number of joints, and its efficiency is compared
    with other published algorithms.

  volume: '92'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Since the new ABET accreditation system was first introduced to American
    engineering education in the middle 1990s as Engineering Criteria 2000, most discussion
    in the literature has focused on how to assess Outcomes 3a-3k and relatively little
    has concerned how to equip students with the skills and attitudes specified in
    those outcomes. This paper seeks to fill this gap. Its goals are to (1) overview
    the accreditation process and clarify the confusing array of terms associated
    with it (objectives, outcomes, outcome indicators, etc.); (2) provide guidance
    on the formulation of course learning objectives and assessment methods that address
    Outcomes 3a-3k; (3) identify and describe instructional techniques that should
    effectively prepare students to achieve those outcomes by the time they graduate;
    and (4) propose a strategy for integrating program-level and course-level activities
    when designing an instructional program to meet the requirements of the ABET engineering
    criteria.

  volume: '34'

  abstract: Deficiencies in engineering education have been exhaustively enumerated
    in recent years. Engineering schools and professors have been told by countless
    panels and blue-ribbon commissions and, in the United States, by the Accreditation
    Board for Engineering and Technology that we must strengthen our coverage of fundamentals;
    teach more about " real-world " engineering design and operations, including quality
    management; cover more material in frontier areas of engineering; offer more and
    better instruction in both oral and written communication skills and teamwork
    skills; provide training in critical and creative thinking skills and problem-solving
    methods; produce graduates who are conversant with engineering ethics and the
    connections between technology and society; and reduce the number of hours in
    the engineering curriculum so that the average student can complete it in four
    years. 1 This is an impressive wish list—especially when the last item is included—that
    cannot possibly be fulfilled using the approach to educating engineers that has
    predominated in the past 50 years. If, for example, courses continue to be confined
    to single subjects (heat transfer in one course, thermodynamics in another, environmental
    engineering in another, technical writing in another, etc.) it will take a six-or
    seven-year curriculum to produce engineers who have the desired proficiency in
    the fundamentals and are conversant with methods of modern engineering practice,
    culturally literate, and skilled in communication. Moreover, if students are assigned
    only well-defined convergent problems, they will never gain the skills needed
    to tackle and solve challenging multidisciplinary problems that call for critical
    judgment and creativity. Finally, even if nothing new is added to the existing
    curriculum, confining it to four years will be almost impossible unless more efficient
    and effective ways to cover the material can be found. The reality is that better
    teaching methods exist. The literature in general education, technical education,
    and educational psychology is replete with methods that have been shown to facilitate
    learning more effectively than the traditional single-discipline lecturing approach.
    Unfortunately, these developments have so far had relatively little impact on
    mainstream engineering education. Although their content has changed in some ways
    and the students use calculators and computers instead of slide rules, many engineering
    classes in 1999 are taught in exactly the same way that engineering classes in
    1959 were taught.

  abstract: Folding robots and metamaterials The same principles used to make origami
    art can make self-assembling robots and tunable metamaterials—artificial materials
    engineered to have properties that may not be found in nature (see the Perspective
    by You). Felton et al. made complex self-folding robots from flat templates. Such
    robots could potentially be sent through a collapsed building or tunnels and then
    assemble themselves autonomously into their final functional form. Silverberg
    et al. created a mechanical metamaterial that was folded into a tessellated pattern
    of unit cells. These cells reversibly switched between soft and stiff states,
    causing large, controllable changes to the way the material responded to being
    squashed. Science, this issue p. 644, p. 647; see also p. 623 Origami can turn
    a sheet of paper into complex three-dimensional shapes, and similar folding techniques
    can produce structures and mechanisms. To demonstrate the application of these
    techniques to the fabrication of machines, we developed a crawling robot that
    folds itself. The robot starts as a flat sheet with embedded electronics, and
    transforms autonomously into a functional machine. To accomplish this, we developed
    shape-memory composites that fold themselves along embedded hinges. We used these
    composites to recreate fundamental folded patterns, derived from computational
    origami, that can be extrapolated to a wide range of geometries and mechanisms.
    This origami-inspired robot can fold itself in 4 minutes and walk away without
    human intervention, demonstrating the potential both for complex self-folding
    machines and autonomous, self-controlled assembly. Origami techniques are used
    to develop crawling robots that self-fold from flat-pack designs. Origami techniques
    are used to develop crawling robots that self-fold from flat-pack designs.

  abstract: Transmissions play a vital role in machines by transforming the torque
    and speed of a motor into a desired output. They are often necessary for operating
    a motor at peak efficiency or power. The majority of variable transmissions are
    mechanically complex, large, and expensive, which limits scalability and is often
    cost prohibitive. As an alternative, we propose an origami-wheel design that is
    capable of varying its own transmission ratio between motor torque and ground
    reaction force, effectively creating a passive, continuously variable transmission.
    The wheel responds to an increase in torque by reducing its radius through the
    spring-like properties of the origami structure, increasing the force applied
    by the wheel to the ground. We demonstrate that the wheel is able to match the
    speed of a 55 mm fixed-radius wheel when unloaded, and can also tow loads as high
    as a 25 mm wheel without stalling. This design could be used to provide smaller,
    cheaper robots with an effective means to vary their output while maintaining
    motor efficiency.

  abstract: Self-folding broadly refers to self-assembly processes wherein thin films
    or interconnected planar templates curve, roll-up or fold into three dimensional
    (3D) structures such as cylindrical tubes, spirals, corrugated sheets or polyhedra.
    The process has been demonstrated with metallic, semiconducting and polymeric
    films and has been used to curve tubes with diameters as small as 2. nm and fold
    polyhedra as small as 100. nm, with a surface patterning resolution of 15. nm.
    Self-folding methods are important for drug delivery applications since they provide
    a means to realize 3D, biocompatible, all-polymeric containers with well-tailored
    composition, size, shape, wall thickness, porosity, surface patterns and chemistry.
    Self-folding is also a highly parallel process, and it is possible to encapsulate
    or self-load therapeutic cargo during assembly. A variety of therapeutic cargos
    such as small molecules, peptides, proteins, bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells
    have been encapsulated in self-folded polymeric containers. In this review, we
    focus on self-folding of all-polymeric containers. We discuss the mechanistic
    aspects of self-folding of polymeric containers driven by differential stresses
    or surface tension forces, the applications of self-folding polymers in drug delivery
    and we outline future challenges. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  container-title: 'Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)'
  page: 14-15
  volume: '82'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: When mammals run, the overall musculoskeletal system behaves as a single
    linear "leg spring". We used force platform and kinematic measurements to determine
    whether leg spring stiffness (k(leg)) is adjusted to accommodate changes in surface
    stiffness (ksurf) when humans hoop in place, a good experimental model for examining
    adjustments to k(leg) in bouncing gaits. We found that k(leg) was greatly increased
    to accommodate surfaces of lower stiffnesses. The series combination of k(leg)
    and ksurf \[total stiffness (ktot)\] was independent of ksurf at a given hopping
    frequency. For example, when humans hopped at a frequency of 2 Hz, they tripled
    their k(leg) on the least stiff surface (ksurf = 26.1 kN/m; k(leg) = 53.3 kN/m)
    compared with the most stiff surface (ksurf = 35,000 kN/m; k(leg) = 17.8 kN/m).
    Values for ktot were not significantly different on the least stiff surface (16.7
    kN/m) and the most stiff surface (17.8 kN/m). Because of the k(leg) adjustment,
    many aspects of the hopping mechanics (e.g., ground-contact time and center of
    mass vertical displacement) remained remarkably similar despite a \>1,000-fold
    change in ksurf. This study provides insight into how k(leg) adjustments can allow
    similar locomotion mechanics on the variety of terrains encountered by runners
    in the natural world.

  abstract: The theory of cortical localization of function holds that different cerebral
    cortical territories serve different functions, such as vision and language. This
    theory began to be entertained in the mid-1700s, but it had no impact until Gall
    made it central to his thinking in the early 1800s. Gall’s organology, with its
    emphasis on cranial bumps, soon fell into disrepute, but in the decades that followed
    Bouillaud, Aubertin, and Broca advanced the concept by turning to clinical cases
    of speech loss, and in 1870 Fritsch and Hitzig demonstrated its validity, studying
    motor functions with animals. The theory of cortical localization of function
    served as a guiding factor in changing the practice of neurology, and clinicians
    encountered new material supportive of the doctrine. Surgical neurology, anatomy,
    and physiology also supported the new way of thinking, contributing to a better
    understanding of the functional organization of the cerebral cortex and to clinical
    neurology.

    an identified model from a prototype robotic fly and implications for vehicle
    design are discussed.

  volume: 2015-June
  issue: June
  abstract: Various robotic applications including surgical instruments, wearable
    robots and autonomous mobile robots are often constrained with strict design requirements
    on high degrees of freedom (DoF) and minimal volume and weight. An intuitive design
    to meet these contradictory requirements is to embed locking mechanism in under
    actuated robotic manipulators to direct the actuation from a single and remote
    source to drive different joints on demand. Mechanical clutches do serve such
    purposes but often are bulky and require auxiliary mechanism making it difficult
    to justify the high cost adding the additional DoF, especially in cm scale. Here,
    we introduce an under-actuated robotic arm with shape memory polymer (SMP) joints.
    Through controlling the temperature, the stiffness of the joints can be adjusted
    and selected joints will be activated while the rest are fixed in their position.
    The presented prototype can control the joints independently with a coupled actuation
    from two stepper motors. Since we have redundant DoFs in the arm, there can be
    more than one configuration to reach a given position. We use a probabilistic
    technique to determine the optimum configuration with the minimum number of active
    joints that can yield the desired posture. In this paper, we report on the performance
    of the proposed design for the hardware and the configuration planner.

  container-title: Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics

  volume: '7'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Intelligent robotic systems that can react to unprogrammed tasks and unforeseen
    environmental changes require augmented “softness.” Robogami, a low-profile origami
    robot, addresses intrinsic (material-wise) and extrinsic (mechanism-wise) softness
    with its multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) body driven by soft actuators. The unique
    hardware of the Robogami and its submillimeter thick construction enable diverse
    transformations as those achievable by the paper origami. The presented Robogami
    shows the first fully integrated version that has all the essential components
    including its controller within a thin sheet. Construction of this robot is possible
    via precise, repeatable, and low cost planar fabrication methods often reserved
    for microscale fabrications. In this research, we aim at expanding the capabilities
    of Robogamis by embedding bidirectional actuation, sensing, and control circuit.
    To assess the performance of the proposed sensors and actuators, we report on
    the performance of these components in a single module and in the four-legged

  abstract: Underactuated systems offer compact design with easy actuation and control
    but at the cost of limited stable configurations and reduced dexterity compared
    to the directly driven and fully actuated systems. Here, we propose a compact
    origami-based design in which we can modulate the material stiffness of the joints
    and thereby control the stable configurations and the overall stiffness in an
    underactuated robot. The robotic origami, robogami, design uses multiple functional
    layers in nominally two-dimensional robots to achieve the desired functionality.
    To control the stiffness of the structure, we adjust the elastic modulus of a
    shape memory polymer using an embedded customized stretchable heater. We study
    the actuation of a robogami finger with three joints and determine its stable
    configurations and contact forces at different stiffness settings. We monitor
    the configuration of the finger using feedback from customized curvature sensors
    embedded in each joint. A scaled down version of the design is used in a two-fingered
    gripper and different grasp modes are achieved by activating different sets of
    joints. &copy; 2004-2012 IEEE.

  abstract: This paper describes the design of a 21 degree-of-freedom, nine degree-of-actuation,
    gas-actuated arm prosthesis for transhumeral amputees. The arm incorporates a
    direct-drive elbow and three degree-of-freedom wrist, in addition to a 17 degree-of-freedom
    underactuated hand effected by five actuators. The anthropomorphic device includes
    full position and force sensing capability for each actuated degree of freedom
    and integrates a monopropellant-powered gas generator to provide on-board power
    for untethered operation. Design considerations addressed in this paper include
    the sizing of pneumatic actuators based on the requisite output energy at each
    joint; the development of small low-power servovalves for use with hot/cold gases;
    the design of compact joints with integrated position sensing; and the packaging
    of the actuators, on-board power, and skeletal structure within the volumetric
    envelope of a normal human forearm and elbow. The resulting arm prototype approaches

  volume: '212'

  abstract: Evolutionary patterns of intrinsic caudal musculature in ray-finned fishes
    show that fine control of the dorsal lobe of the tail evolved first, followed
    by the ability to control the ventral lobe. This progression of increasing differentiation
    of musculature suggests specialization of caudal muscle roles. Fine control of
    fin elements is probably responsible for the range of fin conformations observed
    during different maneuvering behaviors. Here, we examine the kinematics of the
    caudal fin and the motor activity of the intrinsic caudal musculature during kick-and-glide,
    braking and backing maneuvers, and compare these data with our previous work on
    the function of the caudal fin during steady swimming. Kick-and-glide maneuvers
    consisted of large-amplitude, rapid lateral excursion of the tail fin, followed
    by forward movement of the fish with the caudal fin rays adducted to reduce surface
    area and with the tail held in line with the body. Just before the kick, the flexors
    dorsalis and ventralis, hypochordal longitudinalis, infracarinalis and supracarinalis
    showed strong activity. During braking, the dorsal and ventral lobes of the tail
    moved in opposite directions, forming an ;S’-shape, accompanied by strong activity
    in the interradialis muscles. During backing up, the ventral lobe initiated a
    dorsally directed wave along the distal edge of the caudal fin. The relative timing
    of the intrinsic caudal muscles varied between maneuvers, and their activation
    was independent of the activity of the red muscle of the axial myomeres in the
    caudal region. There was no coupling of muscle activity duration and electromyographic
    burst intensity in the intrinsic caudal muscles during maneuvers, as was observed
    in previous work on steady swimming. Principal-component analysis produced four
    components that cumulatively explained 73.6

  abstract: In the attempt to build adaptive and intelligent machines, roboticists
    have looked at neuroscience for more than half a century as a source of inspiration
    for perception and control. More recently, neuroscientists have resorted to robots
    for testing hypotheses and validating models of biological nervous systems. Here,
    we give an overview of the work at the intersection of robotics and neuroscience
    and highlight the most promising approaches and areas where interactions between
    the two fields have generated significant new insights. We articulate the work
    in three sections, invertebrate, vertebrate and primate neuroscience. We argue
    that robots generate valuable insight into the function of nervous systems, which
    is intimately linked to behaviour and embodiment, and that brain-inspired algorithms
    and devices give robots life-like capabilities.

  container-title: IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems
  page: 5430-5436
  issue: '1'
  abstract: — This paper introduces a novel robot which can run on the surface of
    water in a manner similar to basilisk lizards. Previous studies on the lizards
    themselves have characterized their method of propulsion and their means of staying
    afloat. By slapping and stroking their feet into the water, the lizard effects
    a momentum transfer which provides both forward thrust and lift. The design of
    a biomimetic robot utilizing similar principles is discussed, modeled, and prototyped.
    Functionally, the robot uses a pair of identical four bar mechanisms, with a 180
    o phase shift to achieve bipedal locomotion on the water’s surface. Computational
    and experimental results are presented and reviewed with the focus being a maximization
    of the lift to power ratio. After optimization, two legged models can experimentally
    provide 12-15 g/W of lift while four legged models can provide 50 g/W of lift.
    This work opens the door for bipedal and quadrupedal robots to become ambulatory
    over both land and water, and represents a first step toward studies in amphibious
    stride patterns; step motions equally conducive to propulsion on water and land.

  abstract: 'Beyond the Net, say Foster, Kesselman, and a host of impressive contributors,
    lies the Grid. While the Net allows users everywhere to share information, the
    Grid will allow users to share raw computing power. The goal is to put full supercomputing
    capabilities into the hands of anyone who needs it while providing for more efficient
    use of the supercomputers of tomorrow. The potential benefits to science, government,
    and business may well be beyond imagination. Foster and Kesselman have gathered
    together essays, proposals, and ruminations of more than 30 distinguished stars
    of the high-speed computing and networking world in order to do four things: make
    the case for developing computational grids, provide ideas on how such grids may
    be designed, demonstrate how the grids might be used, and point out the research
    still needed to make it happen. While the book was written to serve as a possible
    textbook in advanced networking, it makes fascinating reading for anyone interested
    in the future of network computing. The text covers Grid applications, the programming
    tools required, the services that will be provided, and an examination of Grid
    infrastructure. Despite being the work of so many authors, the chapters are logically
    arranged so that the knowledge needed to understand one chapter is provided by
    those that precede it. -Elizabeth Lewis The grid promises to fundamentally change
    the way we think about and use computing. This infrastructure will connect multiple
    regional and national computational grids, creating a universal source of pervasive
    and dependable computing power that supports dramatically new classes of applications.

    them, who will use them, and how they will be programmed.Inside The Grid Written

  abstract: With particular interest on total hip arthroplasty (THA), optimization
    of orthopedic prostheses is employed in this work to minimize the probability
    of implant failure or maximize prosthesis reliability. This goal is often identified
    with the reduction of stress concentrations at the interface between bone and
    these devices. However, aseptic loosening of the implant is mainly influenced
    by bone resorption phenomena revealed in some regions of the femur when a prosthesis
    is introduced. As a consequence, bone resorption appears due to stress shielding,
    that is to say the decrease of the stress level in the implanted femur caused
    by the significant load carrying of the prosthesis due to its higher stiffness.A
    maximum stiffness topological optimization-based (TO) strategy is utilized for
    non-linear static finite element (FE) analyses of the femurimplant assembly, with
    the goal of reducing stress shielding in the femur and to furnish guidelines for
    re-designing hip prostheses. This is accomplished by employing an extreme accuracy
    for both the three-dimensional reconstruction of the femur geometry and the material
    properties maps assigned as explicit functions of the local densities. Springer-Verlag

  abstract: Modeling from silhouettes is a popular and useful topic in computer vision.
    Many methods exist to compute the surface of the visual hull from silhouettes,
    but few address the problem of ensuring sane topological properties of the surface,
    such as manifoldness. This article provides an efficient algorithm to compute
    such a surface in the form of a polyhedral mesh. It relies on a small number of
    geometric operations to compute a visual hull polyhedron in a single pass. Such
    simplicity enables the algorithm to combine the advantages of being fast, producing
    pixel-exact surfaces, and repeatably yield manifold and watertight polyhedra in
    general experimental conditions with real data, as verified with all datasets
    tested. The algorithm is fully described, its complexity analyzed and modeling
    results given.

  abstract: The problem is to create a hybrid periodic motion, reminiscent of walking,
    for a model of an underactuated biped robot. We show how to construct a transverse
    linearization analytically and how to use it for stability analysis and for design
    of an exponentially orbitally stabilizing controller. In doing so, we extend a
    technique recently developed for continuous-time controlled mechanical systems
    with degree of underactuation one. All derivations are shown on an example of
    a three-link walking robot, modeled as a system with impulse effects. Copyright

  volume: '18'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: The purpose of this research was to improve body powered, voluntary closing
    (VC) prosthetic prehension. A prototype prehensor with variable mechanical advantage
    was fabricated and tested. The device operates at low mechanical advantage during
    sizing of an object to reduce cable excursion requirements. It shifts to high
    mechanical advantage during gripping to allow high prehensile forces to be generated
    with reduced cable tension. The prototype provides a mechanical advantage of 2.4,
    nearly five times that of conventional VC devices. The prototype also acts as
    a holding assist; after grip forces are applied, they can be maintained with a
    cable tension of only 3 lb (13.34N). Field testing indicated that the device performs
    well in many tasks. The mechanism allows greater range of motion while an object
    is grasped than standard voluntary closing prehensors. However, the device performed
    poorly in grasping very compliant objects. To address this problem, a switch has
    been incorporated into the prototype to allow it to be used in a free-wheel mode.

  abstract: Object manipulation with the hand is a complex task. The task has redundancies
    at many levels, allowing many possibilities for the selection of grasp points,
    the orientation and posture of the hand, the forces to be applied at each fingertip
    and the impedance properties of the hand. Despite this inherent complexity, humans
    perform object manipulation nearly effortlessly. This article presents experimental
    findings of how humans grasp and manipulate objects, and examines the compatibility
    of grasps selected for specific tasks. This is accomplished by looking at the
    velocity transmission and force transmission ellipsoids, which represent the transmission
    ratios of the corresponding quantity from the joints to the object, as well as
    the stiffness ellipsoid which represents the directional stiffness of the grasp.
    These ellipsoids allow visualization of the grasp Jacobian and grasp stiffness
    matrices. The results show that the orientation of the ellipsoids can be related
    to salient task requirements.

  abstract: Single cycles of hopping and climbing were investigated in Japanese Pygmy
    Woodpeckers Picoides kizuki using motion analyses on video. Body movements on
    substrate angled from 0-90 degrees were compared for every 10 degrees. The body
    was inclined forward during stance phase for both small and large substrate angles,
    and the inclination amplitude increased when the substrate angle increased. The
    tail was bent ventrally almost simultaneously to this body inclination, and its
    amplitude was apparently high at large substrate angles. Most of the gait parameters
    changed when the stride length increased. The minimum body-tail angle and most
    of the parameters representing body movements during stance phase changed when
    the substrate angle increased, probably because gravity pulled the birds further
    backward when they were moving on a steeper slope. These parameters showed a clear
    difference between the data on substrate steeper than 40 degrees and lower than
    30 degrees. The abrupt changes in these parameters most likely mean that the motor
    pattern changed from hopping to climbing between these angles.

  container-title: The Journal of experimental biology
  page: 369-90
  volume: '158'
  abstract: Many-legged animals, such as crabs and cockroaches, utilize whole-body
    mechanics similar to that observed for running bipeds and trotting quadrupedal
    mammals. Despite the diversity in morphology, two legs in a quadrupedal mammal,
    three legs in an insect and four legs in a crab can function in the same way as
    one leg of a biped during ground contact. To explain how diverse leg designs can
    result in common whole-body dynamics, we used a miniature force platform to measure
    the ground reaction forces produced by individual legs of the cockroach Blaberus
    discoidalis. Hexapedal runners were not like quadrupeds with an additional set
    of legs. In trotting quadrupedal mammals each leg develops a similar ground reaction
    force pattern that sums to produce the whole-body pattern. At a constant average
    velocity, each leg pair of the cockroach was characterized by a unique ground
    reaction force pattern. The first leg decelerated the center of mass in the horizontal
    direction, whereas the third leg was used to accelerate the body. The second leg
    did both, much like legs in bipedal runners and quadrupedal trotters. Vertical
    force peaks for each leg were equal in magnitude. In general, peak ground reaction
    force vectors minimized joint moments and muscle forces by being oriented towards
    the coxal joints, which articulate with the body. Locomotion with a sprawled posture
    does not necessarily result in large moments around joints. Calculations on B.
    discoidalis showed that deviations from the minimum moments may be explained by
    considering the minimization of the summed muscle forces in more than one leg.
    Production of horizontal forces that account for most of the mechanical energy
    generated during locomotion can actually reduce total muscle force by directing
    the ground reaction forces through the leg joints. Whole-body dynamics common
    to two-, four-, six- and eight-legged runners is produced in six-legged runners
    by three pairs of legs that differ in orientation with respect to the body, generate
    unique ground reaction force patterns, but combine to function in the same way
    as one leg of a biped.

  page: 3325-3332
  volume: '202'
  issue: '23'
  abstract: Locomotion results from complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamically
    coupled interactions between an organism and its environment. Fortunately, simple
    models we call templates have been and can be made to resolve the redundancy of
    multiple legs, joints and muscles by seeking synergies and symmetries. A template
    is the simplest model (least number of variables and parameters) that exhibits
    a targeted behavior. For example, diverse species that differ in skeletal type,
    leg number and posture run in a stable manner like sagittal- and horizontal-plane
    spring-mass systems. Templates suggest control strategies that can be tested against
    empirical data. Templates must be grounded in more detailed morphological and
    physiological models to ask specific questions about multiple legs, the joint
    torques that actuate them, the recruitment of muscles that produce those torques
    and the neural networks that activate the ensemble. We term these more elaborate
    models anchors. They introduce representations of specific biological details
    whose mechanism of coordination is of interest. Since mechanisms require controls,
    anchors incorporate specific hypotheses concerning the manner in which unnecessary
    motion or energy from legs, joints and muscles is removed, leaving behind the
    behavior of the body in the low-degree-of-freedom template. Locating the origin
    of control is a challenge because neural and mechanical systems are dynamically
    coupled and both play a role. The control of slow, variable-frequency locomotion
    appears to be dominated by the nervous system, whereas during rapid, rhythmic
    locomotion, the control may reside more within the mechanical system. Anchored
    templates of many-legged, sprawled-postured animals suggest that passive, dynamic
    self-stabilization from a feedforward, tuned mechanical system can reject rapid
    perturbations and simplify control. Future progress would benefit from the creation
    of a field embracing comparative neuromechanics.

  volume: '148'
  abstract: Six-legged pedestrians, cockroaches, use a running gait during locomotion.
    The gait was defined by measuring ground reaction forces and mechanical energy
    fluctuations of the center of mass in Blaberus discoidalis (Serville) as they
    travelled over a miniature force platform. These six-legged animals produce horizontal
    and vertical ground-reaction patterns of force similar to those found in two-,
    four- and eight-legged runners. Lateral forces were less than half the vertical
    force fluctuations. At speeds between 0.08 and 0.66 ms-1, horizontal kinetic and
    gravitational potential energy changes were in phase. This pattern of energy fluctuation
    characterizes the bouncing gaits used by other animals that run. Blaberus discoidalis
    attained a maximum sustainable stride frequency of 13 Hz at 0.35 ms-1, the same
    speed and frequency predicted for a mammal of the same mass. Despite differences
    in body form, the mass-specific energy used to move the center of mass a given
    distance (0.9 J kg-1m-1) was the same for cockroaches, ghost crabs, mammals, and
    birds. Similarities in force production, stride frequency and mechanical energy
    production during locomotion suggest that there may be common design constraints
    in terrestrial locomotion which scale with body mass and are relatively independent
    of body form, leg number and skeletal type.

  abstract: To examine the effects of variation in body form on the mechanics of terrestrial
    locomotion, we used a miniature force platform to measure the ground reaction
    forces of the smallest and, relative to its mass, one of the fastest invertebrates
    ever studied, the American cockroach Periplaneta americana (mass = 0.83 g). From
    0.44-1.0 ms-1, P. americana used an alternating tripod stepping pattern. Fluctuations
    in gravitational potential energy and horizontal kinetic energy of the center
    of mass were nearly in phase, characteristic of a running or bouncing gait. Aerial
    phases were observed as vertical ground reaction force approached zero at speeds
    above 1 ms-1. At the highest speeds (1.0-1.5 ms-1 or 50 body lengths per second),
    P. americana switched to quadrupedal and bipedal running. Stride frequency approached
    the wing beat frequencies used during flight (27 Hz). High speeds were attained
    by increasing stride length, whereas stride frequency showed little increase with
    speed. The mechanical power used to accelerate the center of mass increased curvilinearly
    with speed. The mass-specific mechanical energy used to move the center of mass
    a given distance was similar to that measured for animals five orders of magnitude
    larger in mass, but was only one-hundredth of the metabolic cost.

  abstract: Integrating studies of mechanics, neural control and isolated muscle function
    are possible using arthropod legs. To evaluate leg performance, we measured the
    ground reaction forces generated by individual legs of the six-legged cockroach
    Blaberus discoidalis (3.1 g), during an emergency behavior, righting or over-turning.
    We used a photoelastic method to measure the forces generated by individual legs
    simultaneously. A gelatin track placed between crossed polarizing filters was
    illuminated from below, and a high-speed video camera recorded the stress-induced
    optical signals from above. The size and skew of the optical patterns were found
    to be related to the magnitude and direction of the force. We discovered that
    the ground reaction forces generated during the righting behavior of the death-head
    cockroach were eight times greater than those observed during high-speed running,
    supporting the possibility that relative leg forces (leg force per unit body weight)
    during running and maximal leg activity differ more in small arthropods than in
    larger vertebrates. Non-geometric scaling of relative leg force (i.e. scaling
    to less than body mass-0.33), along with the reduced force-generating ability
    of a single leg in animals with many legs, may help to explain why the maximum
    relative leg force production by six-legged cockroaches, as well as by some other
    small insects, can be similar to the relative single leg forces produced by two-
    and four-legged vertebrates that are almost 1000 times more massive. Leg number
    and body mass alone, however, appear to be insufficient to explain the variation
    observed in relative leg force production at a given body mass, because enormous
    diversity in musculo-skeletal parameters exists. The maximal relative leg force
    of the cockroach B. discoidalis during righting was at the low end of a 100-fold
    variation observed for smaller insects wedging (pushing through a small crevice)
    and pulling loads. Thus, this cockroach can be characterized as a moderately strong
    insect with the capacity for relatively high speed. Results from the present study
    question the predictive strength of the simple geometric scaling arguments involving
    a strength:weight ratio as they are applied to small arthropods and encourage
    further consideration of the importance of leg number, muscle force production
    and mechanical advantage in the derivation of general principles of leg performance.

  abstract: Creating an autonomous flying vehicle the size of a honeybee presents
    a number of technical challenges because of its small scale. As vehicle wingspan
    diminishes, angular acceleration rates increase, necessitating sensing and control
    sys- tems with high bandwidth. Hovering demonstra- tions have so far required
    feedback from high- speedmotion capture cameras to estimate the an- gular velocity,
    attitude, and position of the ve- hicle to provide the continuous corrective feed-
    back necessary to avoid tumbling. To achieve autonomous flight, it will be necessary
    to incor- porate a suite of sensors carried onboard. Here we present a step in
    this direction by integrating a MEMS gyroscope onto an 80 mg flapping-wing micro
    air vehicle to provide attitude feedback in flight. This enables 2–5 s hovering
    flights in which the motion capture system provides only position feedback. Our
    vehicle, and likely oth- ers in the future of similar scale, is propelled by flapping
    wings that generate vibration. Our results indicate that the resulting accelerations,
    measured as high as 5 g by the sensor’s ac- celerometer, significantly distort
    readings from the the accelerometer but not the gyroscope.

  abstract: This paper describes the development of a survey instrument to assess
    K-12 teachers’ perceptions of engineering and their familiarity with teaching
    design, engineering, and technology (DET). Item development, field testing, and
    the factor analysis are described along with reliability and validity. Administration
    of the instrument revealed differences based on gender, grade level taught, and
    years of teaching experience. Female teachers rated the importance of DET higher
    than male teachers, elementary teachers were least likely to teach DET, and moderately
    experienced teachers were the most willing to learn more about DET. Barriers to
    infusing DET into the curriculum were time and administrative support. All teachers
    were unfamiliar with DET, lacked confidence in their ability to teach DET, and
    held stereotypes about the skills needed to be an engineer. Based on the findings,
    recommendations are made for professional development of K-12 teachers and for
    the pre-service teacher preparation curriculum.

  container-title: Journal of neurophysiology
  page: 2849-64
  volume: '106'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: Dexterous use of the hand represents a sophisticated sensorimotor function.
    In behaviors such as playing the piano, it can involve strong temporal and spatial
    constraints. The purpose of this study was to determine fundamental patterns of
    covariation of motion across joints and digits of the human hand. Joint motion
    was recorded while 5 expert pianists played 30 excerpts from musical pieces, which
    featured ∼50 different tone sequences and fingering. Principal component analysis
    and cluster analysis using an expectation-maximization algorithm revealed that
    joint velocities could be categorized into several patterns, which help to simplify
    the description of the movements of the multiple degrees of freedom of the hand.
    For the thumb keystroke, two distinct patterns of joint movement covariation emerged
    and they depended on the spatiotemporal patterns of the task. For example, the
    thumb-under maneuver was clearly separated into two clusters based on the direction
    of hand translation along the keyboard. While the pattern of the thumb joint velocities
    differed between these clusters, the motions at the metacarpo-phalangeal and proximal-phalangeal
    joints of the four fingers were more consistent. For a keystroke executed with
    one of the fingers, there were three distinct patterns of joint rotations, across
    which motion at the striking finger was fairly consistent, but motion of the other
    fingers was more variable. Furthermore, the amount of movement spillover of the
    striking finger to the adjacent fingers was small irrespective of the finger used
    for the keystroke. These findings describe an unparalleled amount of independent
    motion of the fingers.

  page: 1419-1425
  abstract: 2014 IEEE.In this paper we have rapidly prototyped customized, highly-sensitive,
    mm-scale multi-axis force sensors for medical applications. Using a composite
    laminate batch fabrication process with biocompatible constituent materials, we
    have fabricated a fully-integrated, 10×10 mm three-axis force sensor with up to
    5 V/N sensitivity and RMS noise on the order of ∼1.6 mN, operational over a range
    of -500 to 500 mN in the x- and y-axes, and -2.5 to 2.5 N in the z-axis. Custom
    foil-based strain sensors were fabricated in parallel with the mechanical structure,
    obviating the need for post-manufacturing alignment and assembly. The sensor and
    its custom-fabricated signal conditioning circuitry fit within a 1×1×2 cm volume
    to realize a fully-integrated force transduction platform with potential haptics
    and control applications in minimally-invasive surgical tools. The form factor,
    biocompatibility, and cost of the sensor and signal conditioning makes this method
    ideal for rapid-prototyping low-cost, mm-scale distal force sensors. Sensor performance
    is validated in a simulated tissue palpation task using a robotic master-slave
    platform.

  page: 2552-2558
  abstract: The small scale of minimally-invasive surgery (MIS) presents significant
    challenges to developing robust, smart, and dexterous tools for manipulating millimeter
    and sub-millimeter anatomical structures (vessels, nerves) and surgical equipment
    (sutures, staples). Robotic MIS systems offer the potential to transform this
    medical field by enabling precise repair of these miniature tissue structures
    through the use of teleoperation and haptic feedback. However, this effort is
    currently limited by the inability to make robust and accurate MIS end effectors
    with integrated force and contact sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate the use
    of the novel Pop-Up Book MEMS manufacturing method to fabricate the mechanical
    and sensing elements of an instrumented MIS grasper. A custom thin-foil strain
    gage was manufactured in parallel with the mechanical components of the grasper
    to realize a fully-integrated electromechanical system in a single manufacturing
    step, removing the need for manual assembly, bonding and alignment. In preliminary
    experiments, the integrated grasper is capable of resolving forces as low as 30
    mN, with a sensitivity of approximately 408 mV/N. This level of performance will
    enable robotic surgical systems that can handle delicate tissue structures and
    perform dexterous procedures through the use of haptic feedback guidance. 2013

  abstract: This paper details the design, analysis, fabrication, and validation of
    a deployable, atraumatic grasper intended for retraction and manipulation tasks
    in manual and robotic minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures. Fabricated
    using a combination of shape deposition manufacturing (SDM) and 3D printing, the
    device (which acts as a deployable end-effector for robotic platforms) has the
    potential to reduce the risk of intraoperative hemorrhage by providing a soft,
    compliant interface between delicate tissue structures and the metal laparoscopic
    forceps and graspers that are currently used to manipulate and retract these structures
    on an ad hoc basis. This paper introduces a general analytical framework for designing
    SDM fingers where the desire is to predict the shape and the transmission ratio,
    and this framework was used to design a multijointed grasper that relies on geometric
    trapping to manipulate tissue, rather than friction or pinching, to provide a
    safe, stable, adaptive, and conformable means for manipulation. Passive structural
    compliance, coupled with active grip force monitoring enabled by embedded pressure
    sensors, helps to reduce the cognitive load on the surgeon. Initial manipulation
    tasks in a simulated environment have demonstrated that the device can be deployed
    though a 15 mm trocar and develop a stable grasp using Intuitive Surgical’s daVinci
    robotic platform to deftly manipulate a tissue analog.

  abstract: 'Recent advances in medical robotics have initiated a transition from
    rigid serial manipulators to flexible or continuum robots capable of navigating
    to confined anatomy within the body. A desire for further procedure minimization
    is a key accelerator for the development of these flexible systems where the end
    goal is to provide access to the previously inaccessible anatomical workspaces
    and enable new minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures. While sophisticated
    navigation and control capabilities have been demonstrated for such systems, existing
    manufacturing approaches have limited the capabilities of millimeter-scale end-effectors
    for these flexible systems to date and, to achieve next generation highly functional
    end-effectors for surgical robots, advanced manufacturing approaches are required.
    We address this challenge by utilizing a disruptive 2D layerby-layer precision
    fabrication process (inspired by printed circuit board manufacturing) that can
    create functional 3D mechanisms by folding 2D layers of materials which may be
    structural, flexible, adhesive, or conductive. Such an approach enables actuation,
    sensing, circuitry to be directly integrated with the articulating features by
    selecting the appropriate materials during the layer-by-layer manufacturing process.
    To demonstrate the efficacy of this technology, we use it to fabricate three modular
    robotic components at the millimeter-scale: (1) sensors, (2) mechanisms, (3) actuators.
    These modules could potentially be implemented into transendoscopic systems, enabling
    bilateral grasping, retraction and cutting, could potentially mitigate challenging
    MIS interventions performed via endoscopy or flexible means. This research lays
    the ground work for new mechanism, sensor and actuation technologies that can
    be readily integrated via new millimeter-scale layer-by-layer manufacturing approaches.'

    have historically been driven by the oil industry, resulting in destructive interactions
    with undersea life. Soft material robotics relies on compliant materials that
    are inherently impedance matched to natural environments and to soft or fragile
    organisms. We demonstrate design principles for soft robot end effectors, bench-top
    characterization of their grasping performance, and conclude by describing in
    situ testing at mesophotic depths. The result is the first use of soft robotics
    in the deep sea for the nondestructive sampling of benthic fauna.

    methods for controlling Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motor drives, including
    the background analysis using sensors, limitations and advances. The performance

    Then, in this paper sensorless advances are reviewed and recent developments in
    this area are introduced with their inherent advantages and drawbacks, including
    the analysis of practical implementation issues and applications. The study includes
    a deep overview of state-of-the-art back-EMF sensing methods, which includes Terminal
    Voltage Sensing, Third Harmonic Voltage Integration, Terminal Current Sensing,
    Back-EMF Integration and PWM strategies. Also, the most relevant techniques based

    Extended Kalman Filter, Model Reference Adaptive System, Adaptive observers (Full-order
    and Pseudoreduced-order) and Artificial Neural Networks.

  title: <span class="nocase">A novel variable stiffness compliant robotic gripper
    based on layer jamming</span>
  container-title: Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference
  volume: 5B-2019
  abstract: In this paper, we present a novel compliant robotic gripper with three
    variable stiffness fingers. While the shape morphing of the grippers is cable-driven,
    the stiffness variation is enabled by layer jamming. The inherent flexibility
    makes compliant grippers suitable for tasks such as grasping soft and irregular
    objects. However, their relatively low load capacity due to low structural stiffness
    limits their applications. Variable stiffness robotic grippers have the potential
    to address this challenge as their stiffness can be tuned on demand based on the
    needs of tasks. Layer jamming is an emerging method for variable stiffness due
    to its advantages of light weight, simple and quick actuation. In our design,
    the compliant backbone of the fingers is made of 3d printed PLA material. Four
    thin film materials are attached to each side of the skeleton. The working process
    of the robotic gripper follows two basic steps. First, the compliant skeleton
    is bent to a desired shape by actuating a tension cable via a servo motor. Second,
    upon application of a negative pressure by a vacuum pump, the finger is stiffened
    up owing to the increasing of the friction between contact surfaces of layers
    preventing their relative movement. Since the structural stiffness of the fingers
    is increased, their load capacity will be increased proportionally. When the air
    pressure is sufficiently large, the morphed shape can even be locked (no slipping).
    Test for stiffness of individual finger and load capacity of the robotic gripper
    are conducted to validate capability of the design. The results showed a 69-fold
    increase in stiffness of individual finger and a 30-fold increase in gripper’s
    load capacity.

  title: <span class="nocase">Constraint-based exclusion of limb poses for reconstructing
    theropod dinosaur locomotion</span>
  container-title: Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology
  page: 535-544
  volume: '29'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Plausible poses were identified for the hind limb of Tyrannosaurus rex
    and three other non-avian theropod dinosaurs at mid-stance of locomotion using
    constraint-based exclusion. This new method, validated by analysis of two species
    of birds, involves applying demonstrably realistic geometric and kinetic (force-based)
    constraints from extant animals to exclude, rather than include, potential poses.
    Starting with a "configuration space" of millions of candidate poses, we used
    a step-wise series of criteria to constrict the volume to a small subset of solutions,
    which can serve as starting points for reconstructing complete stride cycles.
    It was found that the maximum relative mid-stance limb force, as well as the relative
    number of configurations at lower forces, decreased with increasing body size.
    Constraint-based exclusion restricted Tyrannosaurus to a narrow region of neither
    very columnar nor very flexed poses that may have allowed relatively slow running,
    but no reasonable combinations of input parameters and pose produce forces large
    enough for high speeds. This analysis shows that skeletal information alone has
    limited value for discerning mid-stance poses. Despite additional assumptions,
    unpreserved parameters such as masses, forces, and moments are required to study
    a fossil as a functioning animal, rather than as a moving set of bones. Constraint-based
    exclusion is a transparent, reproducible framework for evaluating functional hypotheses
    in dinosaurs and other taxa.

  container-title: 'Volume 7B: 9th international conference on multibody systems,
    nonlinear dynamics, and control'
  publisher: ASME
  page: V07BT10A051
  abstract: Symbolic equations of motion (EOMs) for multibody systems are desirable
    for simulation, stability analyses, control system design, and parameter studies.
    Despite this, the majority of engineering software designed to analyze multibody
    systems are numeric in nature (or present a purely numeric user interface). To
    our knowledge, none of the existing software packages are 1) fully symbolic, 2)
    open source, and 3) implemented in a popular, general, purpose high level programming
    language. In response, we extended SymPy (an existing computer algebra system
    implemented in Python) with functionality for derivation of symbolic EOMs for
    constrained multibody systems with many degrees of freedom. We present the design
    and implementation of the software and cover the basic usage and workflow for
    solving and analyzing problems. The intended audience is the academic research
    community, graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and those in industry
    analyzing multibody systems. We demonstrate the software by deriving the EOMs
    of a N-link pendulum, show its capabilities for LATEX output, and how it integrates
    with other Python scientific libraries - allowing for numerical simulation, publication
    quality plotting, animation, and online notebooks designed for sharing results.
    This software fills a unique role in dynamics and is attractive to academics and
    industry because of its BSD open source license which permits open source or commercial
    use of the code. Copyright 2013 by ASME.

    reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring–mass model, we show that
    not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics;
    incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the
    model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed
    small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in
    forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter
    space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics
    of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits
    to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant
    leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.

  abstract: Many arthropods are known to achieve dynamic stability during rapid locomotion
    on rough terrains despite the absence of an elaborate nervous system. While muscle
    viscoelasticity and its inherent friction have been thought to cause this passive
    absorption of energy, the role of embedded microstructures in muscles and muscle
    joints has not yet been investigated. Inspired by the soft and flexible hinge
    joints present in many of these animals, we have carried out displacement-controlled
    bending of thin elastic slabs embedded with fluid-filled microchannels. During
    loading, the slab bends uniformly to a critical curvature, beyond which the skin
    covering the channel buckles with a catastrophic decrease in load. In the reverse
    cycle, the buckled skin straightens out but at a significantly lower load. In
    such a loading-unloading cycle, this localized buckling phenomenon results in
    a dynamic change in the geometry of the joint, which leads to a significant hysteresis
    in elastic energy. The hysteresis varies nonlinearly with channel diameters and
    thicknesses of the slab, which is captured by a simple scaling analysis of the
    phenomenon.

  title: <span class="nocase">Fatigue associated with prolonged graded running</span>
  container-title: European Journal of Applied Physiology
  publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg
  page: 1859-1873
  volume: '116'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Scientific experiments on running mainly consider level running. However,
    the magnitude and etiology of fatigue depend on the exercise under consideration,
    particularly the predominant type of contraction, which differs between level,
    uphill, and downhill running. The purpose of this review is to comprehensively
    summarize the neurophysiological and biomechanical changes due to fatigue in graded
    running. When comparing prolonged hilly running (i.e., a combination of uphill
    and downhill running) to level running, it is found that (1) the general shape
    of the neuromuscular fatigue-exercise duration curve as well as the etiology of
    fatigue in knee extensor and plantar flexor muscles are similar and (2) the biomechanical
    consequences are also relatively comparable, suggesting that duration rather than
    elevation changes affects neuromuscular function and running patterns. However,
    ’pure’ uphill or downhill running has several fatigue-related intrinsic features
    compared with the level running. Downhill running induces severe lower limb tissue
    damage, indirectly evidenced by massive increases in plasma creatine kinase/myoglobin
    concentration or inflammatory markers. In addition, low-frequency fatigue (i.e.,
    excitation-contraction coupling failure) is systematically observed after downhill
    running, although it has also been found in high-intensity uphill running for
    different reasons. Indeed, low-frequency fatigue in downhill running is attributed
    to mechanical stress at the interface sarcoplasmic reticulum/T-tubule, while the
    inorganic phosphate accumulation probably plays a central role in intense uphill
    running. Other fatigue-related specificities of graded running such as strategies
    to minimize the deleterious effects of downhill running on muscle function, the
    difference of energy cost versus heat storage or muscle activity changes in downhill,
    level, and uphill running are also discussed.

  abstract: '3D Printing allows the cost-effective and fast fabrication of parts with
    intricate/complex external and internal structure through the controlled addition
    of thin layers of material. This way, heterogeneous structures, i.e. structures
    with non-uniform density, can be constructed. In the present paper a method for
    the production of gradient structures with extrusion-type 3D Printing is discussed.
    The method involves three main steps: defining the geometry and material distribution
    of each layer in the form of a grayscale image, generating a set of points distributed
    according to the gray tone of the image and constructing a continuous path through
    the points for guiding material deposition by the 3D printer. In order to better
    present and test the method, two test cases of gradient structures are examined.'

  abstract: The design of a general-purpose multibody simulator that runs in real-time
    and features haptic display is presented. The repertoire of this simulator includes
    systems subject to holonomic constraints, nonholonomic constraints, and notably,
    systems subject to changing constraints. In contrast to the use of generic equations
    of motion, Kane’s method is used by a computerized symbolic manipulator to produce
    custom-built, compact, and computationally efficient ordinary differential equations
    for each virtual system to be simulated. A method is presented whereby new equations,
    reflecting the presence of a transient constraint, may be formulated on-line by
    a recombination of terms comprising the nominal equations. This paper also serves
    as a tutorial introduction to Kane’s method and includes a detailed derivation
    of Kane’s equations with a geometric interpretation. An illustrative example featuring
    changing constraint conditions is developed in the body of the paper while two
    more examples, chosen to highlight certain features within Kane’s method, are
    presented at the conclusion. 1

  volume: '28'
  issue: '8'
  abstract: Robot manipulators typically rely on complete knowledge of object geometry
    in order to plan motions and compute grasps. However, when an object is not fully
    in view it can be difficult to form an accurate estimate of the object’s shape
    and pose, particularly when the object deforms. In this paper we describe a generative
    model of object geometry based on Mardia and Dryden’s "Probabilistic Procrustean
    Shape", which captures both non-rigid deformations and object variability in a
    class. We extend their shape model to the setting where point correspondences
    are unknown using Scott and Nowak’s COPAP framework. We use this model to recognize
    objects in a cluttered image and to infer their complete two-dimensional boundaries
    with a novel algorithm called OSIRIS. We show examples of learned models from
    image data and demonstrate how the models can be used by a manipulation planner
    to grasp objects in cluttered visual scenes.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a critical review on the calculation of the mobility,
    the main structural and kinematic parameter of a mechanism. We focus on a brief
    presentation and a critical analysis of various methods presented in the literature
    in the last 150 years, to clearly situate the different contributions to this
    very important subject of the theory of mechanisms. Thirty five approaches/formulas
    for mobility calculation are presented and their genesis, similarities and limitations
    are investigated. The various methods proposed in the literature for mobility
    calculation are grouped in two categories: approaches based on setting up the
    kinematic constraint equations and their rank calculation and formulas for a quick
    calculation of mobility without need to develop the constraint equations. We emphasize
    on the limits of formulas for quick calculation of mobility by applying them to
    a parallel robot with elementary legs and ascertaining that the results are erroneous.
    In fact, the formulas for quick calculation of mobility known in the literature
    do not fit for many classical or modern mechanisms. We explain why these formulas
    do not work for certain mechanisms and we propose a new formula for quick mobility
    calculation of parallel mechanisms with elementary legs. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

    a template.</span>
  container-title: The Journal of experimental biology
  page: 2990-3000
  volume: '209'
  issue: Pt 15
  abstract: Rapid, vertically climbing cockroaches produced climbing dynamics similar
    to geckos, despite differences in attachment mechanism, ;foot or toe’ morphology
    and leg number. Given the common pattern in such diverse species, we propose the
    first template for the dynamics of rapid, legged climbing analogous to the spring-loaded,
    inverted pendulum used to characterize level running in a diversity of pedestrians.
    We measured single leg wall reaction forces and center of mass dynamics in death-head
    cockroaches Blaberus discoidalis, as they ascended a three-axis force plate oriented
    vertically and coated with glass beads to aid attachment. Cockroaches used an
    alternating tripod gait during climbs at 19.5+/-4.2 cm s(-1), approximately 5
    body lengths s(-1). Single-leg force patterns differed significantly from level
    running. During vertical climbing, all legs generated forces to pull the animal
    up the plate. Front and middle legs pulled laterally toward the midline. Front
    legs pulled the head toward the wall, while hind legs pushed the abdomen away.
    These single-leg force patterns summed to generate dynamics of the whole animal
    in the frontal plane such that the center of mass cyclically accelerated up the
    wall in synchrony with cyclical side-to-side motion that resulted from alternating
    net lateral pulling forces. The general force patterns used by cockroaches and
    geckos have provided biological inspiration for the design of a climbing robot
    named RiSE (Robots in Scansorial Environments).

  container-title: Nature Communications
  publisher: Springer US
  page: 1-14
  volume: '9'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: As animals develop, tissue bending contributes to shape the organs into
    complex three-dimensional structures. However, the architecture and packing of
    curved epithelia remains largely unknown. Here we show by means of mathematical
    modelling that cells in bent epithelia can undergo intercalations along the apico-basal
    axis. This phenomenon forces cells to have different neighbours in their basal
    and apical surfaces. As a consequence, epithelial cells adopt a novel shape that
    we term “scutoid”. The detailed analysis of diverse tissues confirms that generation
    of apico-basal intercalations between cells is a common feature during morphogenesis.
    Using biophysical arguments, we propose that scutoids make possible the minimization
    of the tissue energy and stabilize three-dimensional packing. Hence, we conclude
    that scutoids are one of nature’s solutions to achieve epithelial bending. Our
    findings pave the way to understand the three-dimensional organization of epithelial
    organs.

  abstract: The Cassie bipedal robot designed by Agility Robotics is providing academics
    a common platform for sharing and comparing algorithms for locomotion, perception,
    and navigation. This paper focuses on feedback control for standing and walking
    using the methods of virtual constraints and gait libraries. The designed controller
    was implemented six weeks after the robot arrived at the University of Michigan
    and allowed it to stand in place as well as walk over sidewalks, grass, snow,
    sand, and burning brush. The controller for standing also enables the robot to
    ride a Segway. A model of the Cassie robot has been placed on GitHub and the controller
    will also be made open source if the paper is accepted.

  abstract: 'We report on the development of a knowledge representation model, which
    is based on the SHARED object model reported in Shared Workspaces for Computer-Aided
    Collaborative Engineering (Wong, A. and Sriram, D., Technical Report, IESL 93-06,
    Intelligent Engineering Systems Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, MIT,
    March, 1993) and Research in Engineering Design (Wong, A. and Sriram, D., SHARED:
    An Information Model for Cooperative Product Development, 1993, Fall, 21-39).
    Our current model is implemented as a layered scheme, that incorporates both an
    evolving artifact and its associated design process. To represent artifacts as
    they evolve, we define objects recursively without a pre-defined granularity on
    this recursive decomposition. This eliminates the need for translations between
    levels of abstraction in the design process. The SHARED model extends traditional
    OOP in three ways: (1) by allowing explicit relationship classes with inheritance
    hierarchies; (2) by permitting constraints to be associated with objects and relationships;
    and (3) by comparing ’similar’ objects at three different levels (form, function
    and behavior). Five primitive objects define the design process: goal, plan, specification,
    decision and context. Goal objects achieve function, introduce constraints, introduce
    new artifacts or modify existing ones, and create subgoals. Plan objects order
    goals and link a product hierarchy to a process hierarchy. Specification objects
    define user inputs as constraints. Decision objects relate goals to user decisions
    and context objects describe the design context. Operators that are applied to
    design objects collectively form a representation of the design process for a
    given context. The representation is robust enough to effectively model four design
    paradigms \[described in Journal of CAD (Gorti, S. and Sriram, R. D., Symbol to
    Form Mapping: a Framework for Conceptual Design, 1996, 28(11), 853-870)\]: top-down
    decomposition, stepwise refinement, bottom-up composition and constraint propagation.
    To demonstrate this, we represent the designs of two TV remote controllers in
    the SHARED architecture. The example reveals that certain aspects of artifact
    knowledge are essentially contextindependent and that this representation can
    be a foundation for robust knowledge-based systems in design. Β 1998 Published

  abstract: Obtaining an accurate mechanical model of a soft deformable robot compatible
    with the computation time imposed by robotic applications is often considered
    an unattainable goal. This paper should invert this idea. The proposed methodology
    offers the possibility to dramatically reduce the size and the online computation
    time of a finite element model (FEM) of a soft robot. After a set of expensive
    offline simulations based on the whole model, we apply snapshot-proper orthogonal
    decomposition to sharply reduce the number of state variables of the soft-robot
    model. To keep the computational efficiency, hyperreduction is used to perform
    the integration on a reduced domain. The method allows to tune the error during
    the two main steps of complexity reduction. The method handles external loads
    (contact, friction, gravity, etc.) with precision as long as they are tested during
    the offline simulations. The method is validated on two very different examples
    of FEMs of soft robots and on one real soft robot. It enables acceleration factors
    of more than 100, while saving accuracy, in particular compared to coarsely meshed
    FEMs and provides a generic way to control soft robots.

  abstract: For aerial robots, maintaining a high vantage point for an extended time
    is crucial in many applications. However, available on-board power and mechanical
    fatigue constrain their flight time, especially for smaller, battery-powered aircraft.
    Perching on elevated structures is a biologically inspired approach to overcome
    these limitations. Previous perching robots have required specific material properties
    for the landing sites, such as surface asperities for spines, or ferromagnetism.
    We describe a switchable electroadhesive that enables controlled perching and
    detachment on nearly any material while requiring approximately three orders of
    magnitude less power than required to sustain flight. These electroadhesives are
    designed, characterized, and used to demonstrate a flying robotic insect able
    to robustly perch on a wide range of materials, including glass, wood, and a natural
    leaf.

  abstract: Locomotion emerges from effective interactions of an individual with its

    on unconfined vertical and horizontal substrates. However, a diversity of organisms
    construct, inhabit, and move within confined spaces. Such animals are faced with
    locomotor challenges including limited limb range of motion, crowding, and visual
    sensory deprivation. Little is known about how these organisms accomplish their
    locomotor tasks, and such environments challenge human-made devices. To gain insight
    into how animals move within confined spaces, we study the locomotion of the fire
    ant Solenopsis invicta, which constructs subterranean tunnel networks (nests).
    Laboratory experiments reveal that ants construct tunnels with diameter, D, comparable
    to body length, L = 3.5 ± 0.5 mm. Ants can move rapidly (\> 9 bodylengths per
    s) within these environments; their tunnels allow for effective limb, body, and
    antennae interaction with walls, which facilitate rapid slip-recovery during ascending
    and descending climbs. To examine the limits of slip-recovery in artificial tunnels,
    we perform perturbations consisting of rapid downward accelerations of the tunnels,
    which induce falls. Below a critical tunnel diameter, Ds = 1.31 ± 0.02 L, falls
    are always arrested through rapid interaction of appendages and antennae with
    tunnel walls to jam the falls. Ds is comparable to the size of incipient nest
    tunnels (D = 1.06 ± 0.23 L), supporting our hypothesis that fire ants construct
    environments that simplify their control task when moving through the nest, likely
    without need for rapid nervous system intervention.

  container-title: IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems
  page: 3397-3403
  issue: Iros
  abstract: The design of flapping wing robots and the study of flapping wing flyers
    requires a detailed knowledge of how wings interact with the surrounding fluid.
    However, the un- steady nature of fluid-structure interactions during flapping
    wing flight render analytical design of wing shapes and motion kinematics difficult.We
    propose that flapping wing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) design will benefit from
    a complimentary, data- driven approach in which wing shape, material properties,
    and stroke-kinematics may be varied rapidly. Here, we present a high-throughput
    experimental apparatus for fabrication and optimization of MAV wings for flapping
    flight. This apparatus incorporates the collection and analysis of multiple sensor
    modalities including force, electrical power, resultant fluid flow, and wing kinematics
    into the experiment control loop. This “analysis-in-the-loop” methodology enables
    multivariate optimization routines for flapping flight of unmanned aerial vehicles.
    We demonstrate the validity of this approach through optimization experiments
    on wing kinematics, fluid flow, lift and power consumption. I.

    gecko setae.</span>
  container-title: Journal of the Royal Society Interface
  page: 259-269
  volume: '7'
  issue: June 2009
  abstract: Geckos owe their remarkable stickiness to millions of dry, hard setae
    on their toes. In this study, we discovered that gecko setae stick more strongly
    the faster they slide, and do not wear out after 30,000 cycles. This is surprising
    because friction between dry, hard, macroscopic materials typically decreases
    at the onset of sliding, and as velocity increases, friction continues to decrease
    because of a reduction in the number of interfacial contacts, due in part to wear.
    Gecko setae did not exhibit the decrease in adhesion or friction characteristic
    of a transition from static to kinetic contact mechanics. Instead, friction and
    adhesion forces increased at the onset of sliding and continued to increase with
    shear speed from 500 nm s(-1) to 158 mm s(-1). To explain how apparently fluid-like,
    wear-free dynamic friction and adhesion occur macroscopically in a dry, hard solid,
    we proposed a model based on a population of nanoscopic stick-slip events. In
    the model, contact elements are either in static contact or in the process of
    slipping to a new static contact. If stick-slip events are uncorrelated, the model
    further predicted that contact forces should increase to a critical velocity (V\*)
    and then decrease at velocities greater than V\*. We hypothesized that, like natural
    gecko setae, but unlike any conventional adhesive, gecko-like synthetic adhesives
    (GSAs) could adhere while sliding. To test the generality of our results and the
    validity of our model, we fabricated a GSA using a hard silicone polymer. While
    sliding, the GSA exhibited steady-state adhesion and velocity dependence similar
    to that of gecko setae. Observations at the interface indicated that macroscopically
    smooth sliding of the GSA emerged from randomly occurring stick-slip events in
    the population of flexible fibrils, confirming our model predictions.

    in anurans.</span>
  container-title: The Journal of experimental zoology
  page: 417-424
  volume: '277'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: 'Unlike other amphibians, frogs often use their forelimbs to capture and
    transport prey. In the present study, high-speed videography was used to observe
    forelimb use during feeding in a diverse group of anurans in order to determine
    the evolution of forelimb movement patterns among anuran taxa. Data were gathered
    from 488 individuals representing 104 species, 55 genera, and 16 families. Five
    distinct behavior patterns were identified: scooping entails using the back of
    the hand to push prey into the mouth; wiping involves the use of the palm of the
    hand to push prey, protruding laterally from the mouth, toward the midline; during
    prey stretching, one end of the prey is held in a stationary position by the hands
    while the other end is pulled upward by the jaws; in grasping, the palms face
    the midline or the substrate as the fingers are wrapped around the prey; grasping
    with wrist rotation is similar to grasping, but the wrists rotate inward as the
    hands grasp the prey so that the palms face the mouth. The distribution of these
    behavior patterns was mapped onto the most recent phylogenetic hypothesis for
    anurans. Maximum parsimony analyses suggest that scooping and wiping are primitive
    and have been retained by many frog lineages. Wiping was not observed in the pipids,
    which are the only anurans that lack tongues and use hydraulic transport. Prey
    stretching appears to have evolved several times in unrelated taxa. Grasping and
    grasping with wrist rotation appear to have evolved only in arboreal groups, suggesting
    that the ability to climb is a preadaptation for the ability to grasp prey. Several
    species were observed using grasping motions in place of the tongue to capture
    prey.'

  abstract: Physical human–robot interaction implies the intersection of human and
    robot workspaces and intrinsically favors collision. The robustness of the most
    exposed parts, such as the hands, is crucial for effective and complete task execution
    of a robot. Considering the scales, we think that the robustness can only be achieved
    by the use of energy storage mechanisms, e.g. in elastic elements. The use of
    variable stiffness drives provides a low-pass filtering of impacts and allows
    stiffness adjustments depending on the task. However, using these drive principles
    does not guarantee the safety of the human due to the dramatically increased dynamics
    of such system. The design methodology of an antagonistically tendon-driven hand
    is explained. The resulting hand, very close to its human archetype in terms of
    size, weight, and, in particular, grasping performance, robustness, and dynamics,
    is presented. The hyper-actuated hand is a research platform that will also be
    used to investigate the importance of mechanical couplings and, in future projects,
    be the basis of a simplified hand that would still perform daily manipulation
    tasks.

  page: 3309-3316
  volume: 201 (Pt 24
  abstract: Pigeons made 10 flights to a novel perch. Kinematic measurements of these
    flights were obtained from video recordings, and the forces exerted on the perch
    on each landing were measured. There was wide variation (20-fold range) in the
    kinetic energy of the pigeons just before landing, arising almost entirely from
    variation in horizontal velocity. The maximum force exerted on the perch varied
    in magnitude from approximately twice to eight times the pigeons’ body weight,
    and in direction from 40 to 90 below the horizontal. In landings with high final
    kinetic energy, the maximum force exerted on the perch was larger and was applied
    at a shallower angle than in those with low final kinetic energy. Landing flights
    with high final kinetic energy showed straighter trajectories and a larger peak
    deceleration during the last 300 ms of approach flight than those with low final
    kinetic energy, which had downward-curving trajectories and a more prolonged and
    steady pattern of deceleration. Mean final kinetic energy was lower in the first
    two landings made on the perch than in subsequent landings, indicating that pigeons
    are more likely to adopt a slow, downward-curving approach to a novel perch and
    a fast, straight approach to a familiar one.

  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 5503-5510
  abstract: — We describe a new series pneumatic artificial muscle (sPAM) and its
    application as an actuator for a soft continuum robot. The robot consists of three
    sPAMs arranged radially around a tubular pneumatic backbone. Analogous to tendons,
    the sPAMs exert a tension force on the robot’s pneu-matic backbone, causing bending
    that is approximately constant curvature. Unlike a traditional tendon driven continuum
    robot, the robot is entirely soft and contains no hard components, making it safer
    for human interaction. Models of both the sPAM and soft continuum robot kinematics
    are presented and experimentally verified. We found a mean position accuracy of
    5.5 cm for predicting the end-effector position of a 42 cm long robot with the
    kinematic model. Finally, closed-loop control is demonstrated using an eye-in-hand
    visual servo control law which provides a simple interface for operation by a
    human. The soft continuum robot with closed-loop control was found to have a step-response
    rise time and settling time of less than two seconds.

  container-title: The Journal of experimental biology
  page: 4215-4223
  volume: '207'
  issue: Pt 24
  abstract: We studied nine adult horses spanning an eightfold range in body mass
    (M(b)) (90-720 kg) and a twofold range in leg length (L) (0.7-1.4 m). We measured
    the horses’ walk-trot transition speeds using step-wise speed increments as they
    locomoted on a motorized treadmill. We then measured their rates of oxygen consumption
    over a wide range of walking and trotting speeds. We interpreted the transition
    speed results using a simple inverted-pendulum model of walking in which gravity
    provides the centripetal force necessary to keep the leg in contact with the ground.
    By studying a large size range of horses, we were naturally able to vary the absolute
    walking speed that would produce the same ratio of centripetal to gravitational
    forces. This ratio, (M(b)v2/L)/(M(b)g), reduces to the dimensionless Froude number
    (v2/gL), where v is forward speed, L is leg length and g is gravitational acceleration.
    We found that the absolute walk-trot transition speed increased with size from
    1.6 to 2.3 m s(-1), but it occurred at nearly the same Froude number (0.35). In
    addition, horses spontaneously switched between gaits in a narrow range of speeds
    that corresponded to the metabolically optimal transition speed. These results
    support the hypotheses that the walk-trot transition is triggered by inverted-pendulum
    dynamics and occurs at the speed that maximizes metabolic economy.

  abstract: '2016 The Author(s). Background: Current prosthetic ankle joints are designed

    a powered prosthetic ankle for walking and running was designed. A powered system
    has the potential to reduce the limitations in range of motion and positive work
    output of passive walking and running feet. Methods: To perform the experiments
    a controller capable of transitions between standing, walking, and running with
    speed adaptations was developed. In the first case study the system was mounted
    on an ankle bypass in parallel with the foot of a non-amputee subject. By this
    method the functionality of hardware and controller was proven. Results: The Walk-Run
    ankle was capable of mimicking desired torque and angle trajectories in walking
    and running up to 2.6 m/s. At 4 m/s running, ankle angle could be matched while
    ankle torque could not. Limited ankle output power resulting from a suboptimal
    spring stiffness value was identified as a main reason. Conclusions: Further studies
    have to show to what extent the findings can be transferred to amputees.'

  abstract: This paper introduces MABEL, a new platform for the study of bipedal locomotion
    in robots. One of the purposes of building the mechanism is to explore a novel
    powertrain design that incorporates compliance, with the objective of improving
    the power efficiency of the robot, both in steady state operation and in responding
    to disturbances. A second purpose is to inspire the development of new feedback
    control algorithms for running on level surfaces and walking on rough terrain.
    A third motivation for building the robot is science and technology outreach;
    indeed, it is already included in tours when K-through-12 students visit the College
    of Engineering at the University of Michigan. MABEL is currently walking at 1.1
    m/s on a level surface, and a related mono-pod at Carnegie Mellon is hopping well,
    establishing that the testbed has the potential to realize its many objectives.

    those inherited traits. Living birds, however, maintain an unusually crouched
    hindlimb posture and locomotion powered by knee flexion, in contrast to the inferred
    primitive condition of non-avian theropods: more upright posture and limb movement
    powered by femur retraction. Such functional differences, which are associated
    with a gradual, anterior shift of the centre of mass in theropods along the bird
    line, make the use of extant birds to study non-avian theropod locomotion problematic.
    Here we show that, by experimentally manipulating the location of the centre of
    mass in living birds, it is possible to recreate limb posture and kinematics inferred
    for extinct bipedal dinosaurs. Chickens raised wearing artificial tails, and consequently
    with more posteriorly located centre of mass, showed a more vertical orientation
    of the femur during standing and increased femoral displacement during locomotion.
    Our results support the hypothesis that gradual changes in the location of the
    centre of mass resulted in more crouched hindlimb postures and a shift from hip-driven
    to knee-driven limb movements through theropod evolution. This study suggests
    that, through careful experimental manipulations during the growth phase of ontogeny,
    extant birds can potentially be used to gain important insights into previously
    unexplored aspects of bipedal non-avian theropod locomotion. Funding: This study

  abstract: 'A major benefit of educational robotics is its hands-on nature. This
    makes the learning process more com- pelling for most students, and underscores
    the con- nection between science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) theory
    and physical reality. Educational haptics takes this premise a step further: haptic
    devices that provide force and tactile feedback to the student are programmed
    to generate physical interactions that improve student intuition for STEM subjects.
    Haptic devices also emphasize the need for interdisciplinary robotics education,
    and can inspire even very young stu- dents to enter STEM fields. In this paper,
    a variety of methods used by Johns Hopkins University researchers to incorporate
    haptic devices and simulations into un- dergraduate, graduate, and grade school
    curricula are reported. Introduction'

  publisher: IEEE
  page: 83-88
  volume: '1'
  abstract: An analysis of force distributions for grasping by robot hands requires
    determination of contact forces between the fingers and the grasped object. This
    topic has been extensively investigated for fingertip grasps under the assumption
    that the fingers have enough joints so that contact forces can be actively controlled.
    This assumption is, however, not valid in power grasps for which the internal
    forces may have uncontrollable components. To ensure that the contact forces can
    be obtained by controlling the joint torques, the uncontrollable components must
    be separated from the internal forces. In this paper, a method is obtained to
    identify those power grasps for which the internal forces have uncontrollable
    components. A new formulation of contact forces is developed for the general solution
    to the force distribution of power grasps and provides a framework for optimization.
    The advantage of the approach is that the joint torques are explicitly considered,
    and, therefore, optimal contact forces can be achieved by modifying the joint
    torques

  volume: '109'

  abstract: This letter describes the fabrication of three-dimensional particulate-like
    hydrogel microstructures using a combination of soft lithography and volume expansion
    induced self-folding. Bilayer structures are produced by solvent casting and photocuring
    of liquid resins. They curl into three-dimensional (3D) structures upon contacting
    with water due to differential swelling of the two layers. The curvature can be
    controlled by adjusting the polymer composition of the primary swelling layer.
    A simple semiempirical mathematical model is used to predict this self-folding
    behavior. By designing the two-dimensional (2D) shapes of the bilayers, this technique
    can lead to complicated 3D microstructures.

  abstract: Parameterized exercises are an important tool for online assessment and
    learning. The ability to generate multiple versions of the same exercise with
    different parameters helps to support learning-by-doing and decreases cheating
    during assessment. At the same time, our experience using parameterized exercises
    for Java programming reveals suboptimal use of this technology as demonstrated
    by repeated successful and failed attempts to solve the same problem. In this
    paper we present the results of our work on modeling and examining patterns of
    student behavior with parameterized exercises using the Problem Solving Genome,
    a compact encapsulation of individual behavior patterns. We started with micro-patterns
    (genes) that describe small chunks of repetitive behavior and constructed individual
    genomes as frequency profiles that show the dominance of each gene in individual
    behavior. The exploration of student genomes revealed the individual genome is
    considerably stable, distinguishing students from their peers. Using the genome,
    we were able to analyze student behavior on the group level and identify genes
    associated with good and poor learning performance.

  volume: '7'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Heterogeneous object design is an active research area in recent years.
    The conventional CAD modeling approaches only provide geometry and topology of
    the object, but do not contain any information with regard to the materials of
    the object and so can not be used for the fabrication of heterogeneous objects
    (HO) through rapid prototyping. Current research focuses on computer-aided design
    issues in heterogeneous object design. A new CAD modeling approach is proposed
    to integrate the material information into geometric regions thus model the material
    distributions in the heterogeneous object. The gradient references are used to
    represent the complex geometry heterogeneous objects which have simultaneous geometry
    intricacies and accurate material distributions. The gradient references helps
    in flexible manipulability and control to heterogeneous objects, which guarantees
    the local control over gradient regions of developed heterogeneous objects. A
    systematic approach on data flow, processing, computer visualization, and slicing
    of heterogeneous objects for rapid prototyping is also presented.

    with One- Versus Two-at-a-Time Swing Leg Motions for RoboSimian</span>
  abstract: This paper presents two planning methods for generating fast walking gaits
    for the quadruped robot RoboSimian and analyzes their feasibility and performance
    as a function of joint velocity limits. One approach uses a two-at-a-time swing
    leg motion gait, generated using preview control of the zero moment point (ZMP)
    on a narrow, double-support base of support. The second method uses a one-at-a-time
    swing leg crawl gait. We employ and compare both value iteration and gradient
    descent methods to generate the motions of the swing leg through free space for
    the crawl gait. For this gait, our optimization strategies exploit redundant degrees
    of freedom in the limb, which proves to increase walking speed significantly.
    By contrast, the ZMP-based gait requires nearly symmetric motions of the (fixed)
    stance legs and (free) swing legs with respect to the body, resulting in limited
    ability to improve the joint trajectories of the limbs through clever planning,
    and so an inverse kinematics (IK) table solution is used for all limb kinematics
    here. Our ZMP-based planning is only feasible if joint velocity limits are sufficiently
    large. Also, both the overall step size and speed of this gait vary nonlinearly
    as velocity limits increase. Lastly, comparing the two methods, we show that walking
    speed is faster using two-at-a-time swing leg motions when the joint velocity
    limit is between 1.62 and 3.62 rad/sec and that the crawl gait is optimal otherwise.

  page: 421-435
  volume: '9'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: 'In robotic excavation, hybrid position/force control has been proposed
    for bucket digging trajectory following. In hybrid position/force control, the
    control mode is required to switch between position- and force-control depending
    on whether the bucket is in free space or in contact with the soil during the
    process. Alternatively, impedance control can be applied such that one control
    mode is employed in both free and constrained motion. This paper presents a robust
    sliding controller that implements impedance control for a backhoe excavator.
    The control law consists of three components: an equivalent control, a switching
    control and a tuning control. Given an excavation task in world space, inverse
    kinematic and dynamic models are used to convert the task into a desired digging
    trajectory in joint space. The proposed controller is applied to provide good
    tracking performance with attenuated vibration at bucket-soil contact points.
    From the control signals and the joint angles of the excavator, the piston position
    and ram force of each hydraulic cylinder for the axis control of the boom, arm,
    and bucket can be determined. The problem is then how to find the control voltage
    applied to each servovalve to achieve force and position tracking of each electrohydraulic
    system for the axis motion of the boom, arm, and bucket. With an observer-based
    compensation for disturbance force including hydraulic friction, tracking of the
    piston ram force and position is guaranteed using robust sliding control. High
    performance and strong robustness can be obtained as demonstrated by simulation
    and experiments performed on a hydraulically actuated robotic excavator. The results
    obtained suggest that the proposed control technique can provide robust performance
    when employed in autonomous excavation with soil contact considerations.'

  title: <span class="nocase">Joint Optimization of Robot Design and Motion Parameters
    using the Implicit Function Theorem</span>
  abstract: '—We present a novel computational approach to optimizing the morphological
    design of robots. Our framework takes as input a parameterized robot design and
    a motion plan consisting of trajectories for end-effectors, as well as optionally,
    for its body. The algorithm we propose is used to optimize design parameters,
    namely link lengths and the placement of actuators, while concurrently adjusting
    motion parameters such as joint trajectories, actuator inputs, and contact forces.
    Our key insight is that the complex relationship between design and motion parameters
    can be established via sensitivity analysis if the robot’s movements are modeled
    as spatio-temporal solutions to optimal control problems. This relationship between
    form and function allows us to automatically optimize robot designs based on specifications
    expressed as a function of range of motion or actuator forces. We evaluate our
    model by computationally optimizing two simulated robots that employ linear actuators:
    a manipulator and a large quadruped. We further validate our framework by optimizing
    the design of a small quadrupedal robot and testing its performance using a hardware
    implementation.'

  page: 2294-2299
  abstract: Skilled drummers can play drum rolls at frequencies well in excess of
    human motor control bandwidths, by allowing the drumstick to bounce passively
    against the drum head at least twice for each hand stroke. We present experimental
    evidence that drummers modulate grasp force to control the effective stiffness
    of the drumstick which in turn determines the bounce frequency. To confirm this
    explanation, we constructed a simple, single-joint robot that emulates the human
    drumming technique. McKibben “artificial muscle” pneumatic actuators were paired
    in an agonist-antagonist configuration, resulting in a slow robot with variable
    passive impedance. The robot can execute drum rolls across a frequency range comparable
    to human drumming (bounce interval=40-160 ms). The results demonstrate that modulation
    of passive impedance can permit a low bandwidth robot to execute certain types
    of fast manipulation tasks

  abstract: Legged robots come in a range of sizes and capabilities. By combining
    these robots into heterogeneous teams, joint locomotion and perception tasks can
    be achieved by utilizing the diversified features of each robot. In this work
    we present a framework for using a heterogeneous team of legged robots to detect
    slippery terrain. StarlETH, a large and highly capable quadruped uses the VelociRoACH
    as a novel remote probe to detect regions of slippery terrain. StarlETH localizes
    the team using internal state estimation. To classify slippage of the VelociRoACH,
    we develop several Support Vector Machines (SVM) based on data from both StarlETH
    and VelociRoACH. By combining the team’s information about the motion of VelociRoACH,
    a classifier was built which could detect slippery spots with 92

  abstract: The X2-VelociRoACH is a 54 gram experimental legged robot which was developed
    to test hypotheses about running with unnaturally high stride frequencies. It
    is capable of running at stride frequencies up to 45 Hz, and velocities up to
    4.9 m/s, making it the fastest legged robot relative to size. The top speed of
    the robot was limited by structural failure. We present new methods and materials
    to make more robust folded robotic structures. High-frequency running experiments
    with the robot shows that the power required to cycle its running appendages increase
    cubically with the stride rate. Our findings show that although it is possible
    to further increase the maximum velocity of a legged robot with the simple strategy
    of increasing stride frequency, considerations must be made for the energetic
    demands of high stride rates.

  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 4569-4575
  abstract: 'As we seek to develop more maneuverable legged robots, we need to understand
    the dynamics of legged turning in an approachable fashion. In this work, we analyze
    the dynamic turning motion of a dynamic hexapedal millirobot. We explore a family
    of phase locked turning gaits where all legs of the robot move at the same speed.
    These gaits are highly periodic, allowing the vertical height and roll angle of
    the robot to be approximated by single harmonic sinusoidal functions. We demonstrate
    that oscillations in height and roll angle determine the robot’s turning behavior.
    The phase between these oscillations (and therefore the turning behavior) was
    modulated by the phase between the left and right sets of legs. A simple model
    using compliant leg forces was shown to match turning behavior for a range of
    5Hz turning gaits. Based on the finding that roll oscillations are major determinants
    of turning behavior, we modified the robot to create a new high speed turning
    gait (forward velocity: 0.4 m/s, turn rate 206°/s).'

  abstract: The VelociRoACH is a 10 cm long, 30 gram hexapedal millirobot capable
    of running at 2.7 m/s, making it the fastest legged robot built to date, relative
    to scale. We present the design by dynamic similarity technique and the locomotion
    adaptations which have allowed for this highly dynamic performance. In addition,
    we demonstrate that rotational dynamics become critical for stability as the scale
    of a robotic system is reduced. We present a new method of experimental dynamic
    tuning for legged millirobots, aimed at finding stable limit cycles with minimal
    rotational energy. By implementing an aerodynamic rotational damper, we further
    reduced the rotational energy in the system, and demonstrated that stable limit
    cycles with lower rotational energy are more robust to disturbances. This method
    increased the stability of the system without detracting from forward speed.

  volume: '1'

  abstract: Several arboreal mammals have the ability to rapidly and repeatedly jump
    vertical distances of 2 m, starting from rest. We characterize this performance
    by a metric we call vertical jumping agility. Through basic kinetic relations,
    we show that this agility metric is fundamentally constrained by available actuator
    power. Although rapid high jumping is an important performance characteristic,
    the ability to control forces during stance also appears critical for sophisticated
    behaviors. The animal with the highest vertical jumping agility, the galago (Galago
    senegalensis), is known to use a power-modulating strategy to obtain higher peak
    power than that of muscle alone. Few previous robots have used series-elastic
    power modulation (achieved by combining series-elastic actuation with variable
    mechanical advantage), and because of motor power limits, the best current robot
    has a vertical jumping agility of only 55

  abstract: New work in robotics targets the development of controllable agile motions
    such as leaping. In this work, we examine animal and robotic systems on the metric
    of jumping agility and find that animals can outperform the most agile robots
    by a factor of two. These specially adapted animals use a jumping strategy we
    term power modulation to generate more peak power for jumping than otherwise possible.
    A novel eight-bar revolute mechanism designed with a new linkage synthesis approach
    encodes the properties for power modulation as well as constraints which assure
    rotation-free jumping motion. We fabricate an 85 gram prototype and demonstrate
    that it can perform a range of jumps while constrained by a linear slide. The
    prototype can deliver 3.63 times more peak jumping power than the maximum its
    motor can produce. A simulation matched to the physical parameters of the prototype
    predicts that the robot can attain an agility exceeding that of the most agile
    animals if the actuator power is increased to 15W.

  abstract: 'In terms of structural complexity, the natural world presents innumerable
    examples of stunning beauty and high functionality, usually with the minimum of
    material and energy expenditure. Materials chemists can harness these amazing
    structures as ready-made scaffolds on which to grow inorganic phases which replicate
    the underlying complexity, thereby producing materials with greatly enhanced physical
    properties. This book comprehensively describes the entire range of natural materials
    that have been used in this way and the inorganic phases which result from them.
    The book covers simple molecules such as cellulose and chitin, to large biological
    constructs such as bacterial proteins, viruses and pollen. Practically every inorganic
    material has been synthesized using biotemplating methods and the book reflects
    this, ranging from simple oxides and carbonates such as silica and calcite, to
    complex semi- and superconducting materials. The book also discusses the formation
    of these materials from a mechanistic point of view, thereby enabling the reader
    to better understand the processes involved in biotemplated mineralization.Contents:

    film in contact with the layer of adhesive. The layer of adhesive preferentially
    adheres to the piece of flexible film. The forming screen has a plurality of recesses

    Another step forms the piece of flexible film to create a plurality of protrusions
    extending into the recesses. The plurality of protrusions are registered with
    the interconnected layer of pressure sensitive adhesive by virtue of using the
    same screen to transfer adhesive and to form protrusions. The forming screen may
    be wrapped around a rotating drum and the piece of flexible film may be a portion
    of a continuous web of flexible film. Preferably, the plurality of protrusions
    are conical, with a base diameter of 0.015 inches to 0.030 inches, a center-to-center
    spacing of 0.03 to 0.06 inches, and a protrusion height of 0.004 to 0.012 inches.

    of variable stiffness inflatable structures for soft pneumatic supernumerary robotic
    (SR) fingers. These novel pneumatic SR fingers consist of inflatable, rigidizable
    finger phalanges and variable stiffness pneumatic bending actuators which are
    designed and manufactured using soft robot fabrication methods. The buckling conditions
    of the phalanges are predicted using a simplified deformation model and validated
    by empirical data to allow the prediction load bearing capacity, and the mechanical
    behavior of the bending actuators is empirically characterized for stiffness tuning
    capability. Experimental testing of a wearable, clinically-focused pneumatic SR
    grasp assist device demonstrates the feasibility of using variable stiffness pneumatic
    structures to produce grasp synergies without the need for complicated, high power
    mechanisms or precise, low-level motion control

  abstract: 'Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), based on already well-researched Human-Computer
    Interaction (HCI), has been under vigorous scrutiny since recent developments
    in robot technology. Robots may be more successful in establishing common ground
    in project-based education or foreign language learning for children than in traditional
    media. Backed by its strong IT environment and advances in robot technology, Korea
    has developed the world’s first available e-Learning home robot. This has demonstrated
    the potential for robots to be used as a new educational media - robot-learning,
    referred to as ‘r-Learning’. Robot technology is expected to become more interactive
    and user-friendly than computers. Also, robots can exhibit various forms of communication
    such as gestures, motions and facial expressions. This study compared the effects
    of non-computer based (NCB) media (using a book with audiotape) and Web-Based
    Instruction (WBI), with the effects of Home Robot-Assisted Learning (HRL) for
    children. The robot gestured and spoke in English, and children could touch its
    monitor if it did not recognize their voice command. Compared to other learning
    programs, the HRL was superior in promoting and improving children’s concentration,
    interest, and academic achievement. In addition, the children felt that a home
    robot was friendlier than other types of instructional media. The HRL group had
    longer concentration spans than the other groups, and the p-value demonstrated
    a significant difference in concentration among the groups. In regard to the children’s
    interest in learning, the HRL group showed the highest level of interest, the
    NCB group and the WBI group came next in order. Also, academic achievement was
    the highest in the HRL group, followed by the WBI group and the NCB group respectively.
    However, a significant difference was also found in the children’s academic achievement
    among the groups. These results suggest that home robots are more effective as
    regards children’s learning concentration, learning interest and academic achievement
    than other types of instructional media (such as: books with audiotape and WBI)
    for English as a foreign language. Keywords:'

  abstract: The origami waterbomb base is a single-vertex bistable origami mechanism
    that has unique propertieswhich may prove useful in a variety of applications.
    It also shows promise as a test bed for smartmaterials and actuation because of
    its straightforward geometry and multiple phases of motion,ranging from simple
    to more complex. This study develops a quantitative understanding of thesymmetric
    waterbomb baseʼs kinetic behavior. This is done by completing kinematic and potentialenergy
    analyses to understand and predict bistable behavior. A physical prototype is
    constructed andtested to validate the results of the analyses. Finite element
    and virtual work analyses based onthe prototype are used to explore the locations
    of the stable equilibrium positions and theforce–deflection response. The model
    results are verified through comparisons to measurements on aphysical prototype.
    The resulting models describe waterbomb base behavior and provide an engineeringtool
    for application development.

  abstract: This paper presents quantification of multidimensional ankle stability
    in relation to mechanical environments having different levels of stability. This
    study, for the first time, explores the range of stiffness-defined haptic environments
    over which young healthy individuals can maintain stability despite aggressive
    perturbation. Ankle stability was quantified in 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) of the
    ankle, in both the sagittal and frontal planes. Importantly, the magnitude of
    negative environmental stiffness that the subjects could maintain stability is
    4 times as great in the sagittal plane as in the frontal plane. In addition to
    managing a wider range of unstable environments in the sagittal plane, subjects
    were also more efficient at regaining stability after perturbation and less sensitive
    to changes in the environmental stiffness. Outcomes of this study would be beneficial
    to the design and control of robots physically interacting with human lower extremities,
    such as lower-limb exoskeletons and powered ankle-foot orthoses.

  abstract: Soft robotic technologies have been widely used in the fields like bio-robotics,
    wearable devices, and industrial manipulations. However, existing soft robots
    usually require multiple pneumatic/fluidic channels for pressurizing soft material
    segments in series or in parallel to achieve multiple mechanical degrees of freedom.
    In this study, we demonstrated a soft actuator embedded with Low-Melting-Point
    Alloy (LMPA), with which the mechanical degrees and stiffness can be selectively
    controlled. The LMPA was embedded in the bottom of the actuator, with the Ni-Cr
    wires serpentining under different positions of the LMPA layer. Through a reheating-
    recrystallizing circle, the actuator can self-heal and recover from the crack
    state. The melting process of the LMPA under different currents and different
    sections, the variable stiffness, the self-healing properties, and the programmable
    mechanical freedom of the actuator was explored through experiments. The results
    showed that the LMPA could be melted about 10, s under the current of 0.7, A.
    With the LMPA, the bending force and the elasticity modulus of the actuator could
    be enhanced up to 16 times and 4,000 times separately. Moreover, up to six motion
    patterns could be achieved under the same air pressure inflated to a typical single-chamber
    soft actuator. The combination of Low-Melting-Point Alloy and the soft actuators
    may open up a diversity of applications for future soft robotics.

  abstract: The monkey premotor cortex contains neurons that discharge during action
    execution and during observation of actions made by others. Transcranial magnetic
    stimulation experiments suggest that a similar observation/execution matching
    system also is present in humans. We recorded neuromagnetic oscillatory activity
    of the human precentral cortex from 10 healthy volunteers while (i) they had no
    task to perform, (ii) they were manipulating a small object, and (iii) they were
    observing another individual performing the same task. The left and right median
    nerves were stimulated alternately (interstimulus interval, 1.5 s) at intensities
    exceeding motor threshold, and the poststimulus rebound of the rolandic 15- to
    25-Hz activity was quantified. In agreement with previous studies, the rebound
    was strongly suppressed bilaterally during object manipulation. Most interestingly,
    the rebound also was significantly diminished during action observation (31-46

  abstract: 'Micro brushed and brushless motors of the size typically used on micro-ground
    vehicles and micro-air vehicles have been found to have very low efficiencies.
    This lack of efficiency not only stems from low manufacturing tolerances, but
    is also because motors at these scales are generally operated over a large range
    of loading conditions causing them to operate off design point. This technical
    report: (1) provides a basis for a simple motor analysis, comparing analysis with
    actual motor test data, (2) examines the efficiencies of many of the off-the-shelf
    brushed and brushless motors used in micro vehicle applications, and (3) provides
    a methodology for proper motor selection, emphasizing the importance in ensuring
    motor loading conditions are matched to the motor design in order to maximize
    power efficiency.'

  abstract: The K-means clustering algorithm is described in detail by Hartigan (1975).
    An efficient version of the algorithm is presented here. The aim of the K-means
    algorithm is to divide M points in N dimensions into K clusters so that the within-cluster
    sum of squares is minimized. It is not practical to require that the solution
    has minimal sum of squares against all partitions, except when M, N are small
    and K = 2. We seek instead "local" optima, solutions such that no movement of
    a point from one cluster to another will reduce the within-cluster sum of squares.

    Kinematic and Preintegrated Contact Factors</span>
  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 4422-4429
  abstract: State-of-the-art robotic perception systems have achieved sufficiently
    good performance using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), cameras, and nonlinear
    optimization techniques, that they are now being deployed as technologies. However,
    many of these methods rely significantly on vision and often fail when visual
    tracking is lost due to lighting or scarcity of features. This paper presents
    a state-estimation technique for legged robots that takes into account the robot’s
    kinematic model as well as its contact with the environment. We introduce forward
    kinematic factors and preintegrated contact factors into a factor graph framework
    that can be incrementally solved in real-time. The forward kinematic factor relates
    the robot’s base pose to a contact frame through noisy encoder measurements. The
    preintegrated contact factor provides odometry measurements of this contact frame
    while accounting for possible foot slippage. Together, the two developed factors
    constrain the graph optimization problem allowing the robot’s trajectory to be
    estimated. The paper evaluates the method using simulated and real sensory IMU
    and kinematic data from experiments with a Cassie-series robot designed by Agility
    Robotics. These preliminary experiments show that using the proposed method in
    addition to IMU decreases drift and improves localization accuracy, suggesting
    that its use can enable successful recovery from a loss of visual tracking.

    visual design tool that provides a low threshold for early-stage prototyping,
    extensible through code for higher-fidelity prototypes. Second, our research introduces
    three important types of hardware extensibility - at the hardware-to-PC interface,
    the intra-hardware communication level, and the circuit level. Third, d.tools
    integrates design, test, and analysis of information appliances. We have evaluated
    d.tools through three studies: a laboratory study with thirteen participants;
    rebuilding prototypes of existing and emerging devices; and by observing seven
    student teams who built prototypes with d.tools.'

  abstract: Many researchers have been studied on acceleration control algorithms
    for biped robots to deal with uneven terrain. However, the control algorithms
    are difficult to be used for human-carrying biped walking robots because of modeling
    errors. In this paper, a landing pattern modification method is proposed which
    based on nonlinear compliance control. Theoretical compliance displacements calculated
    from a walking pattern are compared with the actual compliance displacements,
    while a robot’s foot touches slightly uneven terrain. In result, the height of
    landing terrain is detected, and the preset walking pattern is modified. Using
    this method, a human-carrying biped robot would be able to walk stably on uneven
    terrain. This pattern modification method does not need any special sensors except
    force sensors. Through various walking experiments, the effectiveness of the method
    is confirmed

    In doing so, they provide powerful, intuitive representations of the bounds on
    a system’s locomotion capabilities and the forms of its optimal strokes or gaits.
    While this approach has been successful for finding net rotations, noncommutativity
    concerns have prevented it from working for net translations. Our recent results
    on other locomoting systems have shown that the degree of this noncommutativity
    is dependent on the coordinates used to describe the problem and that it can be
    greatly mitigated by an optimal choice of coordinates. Here, we extend the benefits
    of this optimal-coordinate approach to the analysis of swimming at the extremes
    of low and high Reynolds numbers. 2004-2012 IEEE.

  abstract: 'The apparent "distance" between two configurations of a system and the
    "length" of trajectories through its configuration space can be significantly
    distorted by plots that use "natural" or intuitively selected coordinates. This
    effect is similar to the way that a latitude-longitude plot of the Earth distorts
    the size and shape of the continents. In this paper, we explore how ideas from
    cartography can be used to identify system parameterizations that better reflect
    the effort costs of changing configuration. We then apply these new parameters
    to provide geometric insight about two aspects ofmoving in dissipative environments
    such as lowReynolds number fluids: The shape of the optimal gait cycle for a three-link
    swimmer and the fundamentally superior efficiency of a serpenoid swimmer as compared
    to the classic three-link system.'

  volume: '2'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: 'In robotics, controlling the stiffness of the joints that contribute
    to the robots’ degree of freedom dictates the adaptability, versatility, and safety
    of the whole system. We can achieve variable stiffness or impedance in a robotic
    system purely by the control or by introducing new material or mechanisms to address
    cases that require innate safety through system compliancy. This paper presents
    JammJoint, a compliant and flexible wearable robot, which uses jamming of granular
    media to vary its stiffness. It consists of a silicone sleeve with hollow sections
    that are filled with cubic rubber granules and subjected to different levels of
    vacuum pressure. Unlike contemporary vacuum-based actuators or systems, JammJoint
    is wearable, portable, and autonomous: It uses a powerful miniature vacuum pump,
    a small battery, and bluetooth-enabled electronics. Experiments revolving around
    bending and torsional stiffness show that the system is able to achieve up to
    a fourfold increase in spring stiffness. Further measurements of individual variable
    stiffness structures indicate that for other modes of deformation, including simply
    supported bending or compression for alternative linear applications, higher changes
    in stiffness over a factor of seven are possible. These aspects make mobile jamming-based
    stiffness variation as wearable joint assistance promising for future applications
    such as rehabilitation after injuries and joint support in challenging working
    conditions.'

  volume: '107'
  issue: '28'
  abstract: Programmable matter is a material whose properties can be programmed to
    achieve specific shapes or stiffnesses upon command. This concept requires constituent
    elements to interact and rearrange intelligently in order to meet the goal. This
    paper considers achieving programmable sheets that can form themselves in different
    shapes autonomously by folding. Past approaches to creating transforming machines
    have been limited by the small feature sizes, the large number of components,
    and the associated complexity of communication among the units. We seek to mitigate
    these difficulties through the unique concept of self-folding origami with universal
    crease patterns. This approach exploits a single sheet composed of interconnected
    triangular sections. The sheet is able to fold into a set of predetermined shapes
    using embedded actuation. To implement this self-folding origami concept, we have
    developed a scalable end-to-end planning and fabrication process. Given a set
    of desired objects, the system computes an optimized design for a single sheet
    and multiple controllers to achieve each of the desired objects. The material,
    called programmable matter by folding, is an example of a system capable of achieving
    multiple shapes for multiple functions.

  abstract: Wearable robots, especially power suits to enhance human activity are
    one of most interesting topics. This study aims to develop a power suit installing
    a variable stiffness mechanism. In a previous study, we showed the relation between
    impedance parameters of power suits and human performance, and verified the effectiveness
    of self impedance matching method using soft computings. In this paper, we conduct
    fundamental experiments in order to design a variable stiffness mechanism which
    can tune the stiffness of joint mechanically. Experimental results show the effectiveness
    of variable stiffness for improving human performance and reducting muscle fatigue.
    Moreover, we try to design the variable stiffness mechanism, and to verify the
    effectiveness by simulation. 2004 IEEE.

  page: 305-320
  volume: '69'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Wings have long been regarded as a hallmark of evolutionary innovation,
    allowing insects, birds, and bats to radiate into aerial environments. For many
    groups, our intuitive and colloquial perspective is that wings function for aerial
    activities, and legs for terrestrial, in a relatively independent manner. However,
    insects and birds often engage their wings and legs cooperatively. In addition,
    the degree of autonomy between wings and legs may be constrained by tradeoffs,
    between allocating resources to wings versus legs during development, or between
    wing versus leg investment and performance (because legs must be carried as baggage
    by wings during flight and vice versa). Such tradeoffs would profoundly affect
    the development and evolution of locomotor strategies, and many related aspects
    of animal ecology. Here, we provide the first evaluation of wing versus leg investment,
    performance and relative use, in birds—both across species, and during ontogeny
    in three precocial species with different ecologies. Our results suggest that
    tradeoffs between wing and leg modules help shape ontogenetic and evolutionary
    trajectories, but can be offset by recruiting modules cooperatively. These findings
    offer a new paradigm for exploring locomotor strategies of flying organisms and
    their extinct precursors, and thereby elucidating some of the most spectacular
    diversity in animal history.

  abstract: Fitting of uncertain data, that is, fitting of data points that are subject
    to some error, has important applications for example in statistics and for the
    evaluation of results from physical experiments. Fitting in these problem domains
    is usually achieved with polynomial approximation, which involves the minimization
    of an error at discrete data points. Norms typically used for this minimization
    include the l1, l2 and l∞ norms, which are chosen depending on the problem domain
    and the expected type of error on the data points.

  abstract: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the possible roles of
    active tails for steady-state legged locomotion, focusing on a design principle
    which simplifies control by decoupling different control objectives. Design/methodology/approach
    A series of simple models are proposed which capture the dynamics of an idealized
    running system with an active tail. These models suggest that the overall control
    problem can be simplified and effectively decoupled via a proper tail design.
    This design principle is further explored in simulation using trajectory optimization.
    The results are then validated in hardware using a one degree-of-freedom active
    tail mounted on the quadruped robot Cheetah-Cub. Findings The results of this
    paper show that an active tail can greatly improve both forward velocity and reduce
    body-pitch per stride while adding minimal complexity. Further, the results validate
    the design principle of using long, light tails compared to shorter heavier ones.

  abstract: A finite volume method for geometries parameterized by Non-Uniform Rational
    B-Splines (NURBS) is proposed. Since the computational grid is inherently defined
    by the knot vectors of the NURBS parameterization, the mesh generation step simplifies
    here greatly and furthermore curved boundaries are resolved exactly. Based on
    the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the main steps of the discretization
    are presented, with emphasis on the preservation of geometrical and physical properties.
    Moreover, the method is combined with a structural solver based on isogeometric
    finite elements in a partitioned fluid-structure interaction coupling algorithm
    that features a gap-free and non-overlapping interface even in the case of non-matching
    grids. 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Engineering sketches and drawings are the building blocks of technological
    design and production. These visual representations act as the means for organizing
    the design to production process, hence serving as a "social glue" both between
    individuals and between groups. The author discusses two main capacities such
    visual representations serve in facilitating distributed cognition in team design
    work As conscription devices, they enlist and organize group participation. As
    boundary objects, they facilitate the reading of alternative meanings by various
    groups involved in the design process. The introduction of computer-aided design
    into this visual culture of engineering restructures relationships between workers
    in ways that can hamper the flexibility necessary for these crucial capacities
    to take place. The data are drawn from a study of the daily practices of engineers
    engaged in redesigning a turbine engine package. The method is participant observation.

    on a Cassie-Series Dynamic Walking Biped</span>
  abstract: One of the big attractions of low-dimensional models for gait design has
    been the ability to compute solutions rapidly, whereas one of their drawbacks
    has been the difficulty in mapping the solutions back to the target robot. This
    paper presents a set of tools for rapidly determining solutions for “humanoids”
    without removing or lumping degrees of freedom. The main tools are (1) C-FROST,
    an open-source C++ interface for FROST, a direct collocation optimization tool;
    and (2) multi-threading. The results will be illustrated on a 20-DoF floating-base
    model for a Cassie-series bipedal robot through numerical calculations and physical
    experiments.

  container-title: The Journal of experimental biology
  page: 959-967
  volume: '205'
  issue: Pt 7
  abstract: Although the effects of body size on mammalian locomotion are well documented,
    the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we present a computational
    model of the mechanics, control and energetics that unifies some well-known scale
    effects in running quadrupeds. The model consists of dynamic, physics-based simulations
    of six running mammals ranging in size from a chipmunk to a horse (0.115-676 kg).
    The ’virtual animals’ are made up of rigid segments (head, trunk and four legs)
    linked by joints and are similar in morphology to particular species. In the model,
    each stance limb acts as a spring operating within a narrow range of stiffness,
    forward motion is powered and controlled by active hip and shoulder torques, and
    metabolic cost is predicted from the time course of supporting body weight. Model
    parameters that are important for stability (joint stiffnesses, limb-retraction
    times and target positions and velocities of the limbs) are selected such that
    (i) running kinematics (aerial height, forward speed and body pitch) is smooth
    and periodic and (ii) overall leg stiffness is in agreement with published data.
    Both trotting and galloping gaits are modeled, and comparisons across size are
    made at speeds that are physiologically similar among species. Model predictions
    are in agreement with data on vertical stiffness, limb angles, metabolic cost
    of transport, stride frequency, peak force and duty factor. This work supports
    the idea that a single, integrative model can predict important features of running
    across size by employing simple strategies to control overall leg stiffness. More
    broadly, the model provides a quantitative framework for testing hypotheses that
    relate limb control, stability and metabolic cost.

  publisher: Elsevier Inc.
  page: 22-28
  volume: '83'
  abstract: There remains a need for rapid, specific and sensitive assays for the
    detection of bacterial indicators for water quality monitoring. In this study,
    a strategy for rapid detection of Escherichia coli in drinking water has been
    developed. This strategy is based on the use of the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-$\beta$-
    d-glucuronide (MUG), which is hydrolyzed rapidly by the action of E. coli $\beta$-
    d-glucuronidase (GUD) enzyme to yield a fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU)
    product that can be quantified and related to the number of E. coli cells present
    in water samples. In this study, the detection time required for the biosensor
    response ranged between 20 and 120. min, depending on the number of bacteria in
    the sample. This approach does not need extensive sample processing with a rapid
    detection capability. The specificity of the MUG substrate was examined in both,
    pure cultures of non-target bacterial genera such as Klebsiella, Salmonella, Enterobacter
    and Bacillus. Non-target substrates that included 4-methylumbelliferyl-$\beta$-
    d-galactopyranoside (MUGal) and l-leucine $\beta$-naphthylamide aminopeptidase
    (LL$\beta$-N) were also investigated to identify nonspecific patterns of enzymatic
    activities in E. coli. GUD activity was found to be specific for E. coli and no
    further enzymatic activity was detected by other species. In addition, fluorescence
    assays were performed for the detection of E. coli to generate standard curves;
    and the sensitivity of the GUD enzymatic response was measured and repeatedly
    determined to be less than 10 E. coli cells in a reaction vial. The applicability
    of the method was tested by performing multiple fluorescence assays under pure
    and mixed bacterial flora in environmental samples. The results of this study
    showed that the fluorescence signals generated in samples using specific substrate
    molecules can be utilized to develop a bio-sensing platform for the detection
    of E. coli in drinking water. Furthermore, this system can be applied independently
    or in conjunction with other methods as a part of an array of biochemical assays
    in order to reliably detect E. coli in water.

  volume: '52'

  abstract: Subterranean rodents were thought to forage underground for edible roots
    and bulbs without the benefit of any sensory cues. Subterranean rodents representing
    four genera from three families (East-Mediterranean Spalax, African Cryptomys
    and Heterocephalus, and South American Spalacopus), tested in T-mazes filled with
    soil in which edible plants either had or had not been growing, used odours to
    discriminate between the soils and chose to dig in the soil containing odorous
    substances (kairomones) released from roots of growing plants. Such discriminations
    could enable them to orienttheir digging toward food sources in the field and
    thus to improve their foraging efficiency. Spalax blind mole-rats also discriminated
    between the odours from soil in which edible as opposed to poisonous plants had
    been growing. These species evolved independently on three continents; thus their
    abilities probably are characteristic of subterranean rodents in general.

  abstract: The advent of multi-material freeform fabrication technologies has exponentially
    increased the mechanical design space available to engineers. The feature-based
    paradigm of traditional CAD software is insufficient to take advantage of the
    freedom of internal material distribution and gradients. Here we present a flexible
    evolutionary design algorithm for 3D multi-material structures that fully utilizes
    this expanded design space. The material distribution is optimized subject to
    high level functional constraints, or simple constraints such as maximizing stiffness
    per weight. The algorithm is inherently capable of shape optimization, or can
    simply optimize material distribution within a given geometry. We demonstrate
    autonomous design of freeform shapes, 3D non-uniform structures, and 3D compliant
    actuators.

  title: <span class="nocase">Dynamic Simulation of Soft Heterogeneous Objects</span>
  abstract: This paper describes a 2D and 3D simulation engine that quantitatively
    models the statics, dynamics, and non-linear deformation of heterogeneous soft
    bodies in a computationally efficient manner. There is a large body of work simulating
    compliant mechanisms. These normally assume small deformations with homogeneous
    material properties actuated with external forces. There is also a large body
    of research on physically-based deformable objects for applications in computer
    graphics with the purpose of generating realistic appearances at the expense of
    accuracy. Here we present a simulation framework in which an object may be composed
    of any number of interspersed materials with varying properties (stiffness, density,
    etc.) to enable true heterogeneous multi-material simulation. Collisions are handled
    to prevent self-penetration due to large deformation, which also allows multiple
    bodies to interact. A volumetric actuation method is implemented to impart motion
    to the structures which opens the door to the design of novel structures and mechanisms.
    The simulator was implemented efficiently such that objects with thousands of
    degrees of freedom can be simulated at suitable framerates for user interaction
    using a single thread of a typical desktop computer. The code is written in platform
    agnostic C++ and is fully open source. This research opens the door to the dynamic
    simulation of freeform 3D multi-material mechanisms and objects in a manner suitable
    for design automation.

    3D voxel printing</span>
  container-title: Rapid Prototyping Journal
  page: 137-149
  volume: '15'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Purpose – Virtual voxels (3D pixels) have traditionally been used as a
    graphical data structure for representing 3D geometry. The purpose of this paper
    is to study the use of pre-existing physical voxels as a material building-block
    for layered manufacturing and present the theoretical underpinnings for a fundamentally
    new massively parallel additive fabrication process in which 3D matter is digital.
    The paper also seeks to explore the unique possibilities enabled by this paradigm.
    Design/methodology/approach – Digital RP is a process whereby a physical 3D object
    is made of many digital units (voxels) arranged selectively in a 3D lattice, as
    opposed to analog (continuous) material commonly used in conventional rapid prototyping.
    The paper draws from fundamentals of 3D space-filling shapes, large-scale numerical
    simulation, and a survey of modern technology to reach conclusions on the feasibility
    of a fabricator for digital matter. Findings – Design criteria and appropriate
    3D voxel geometries are presented that self-align and are suitable for rapid parallel
    assembly and economical manufacturing. Theory and numerical simulation predict
    dimensional accuracy to scale favorably as the number of voxels increases. Current
    technology will enable rapid parallel assembly of billions of microscale voxels.
    Research limitations/implications – Many novel voxel functions could be realized
    in the electromechanical and microfluidic domains, enabling inexpensive prototyping
    of complex 3D integrated systems. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of a
    3D digital fabricator, but an instantiation is out of scope and left to future
    work. Practical implications – Digital manufacturing offers the possibility of
    desktop fabrication of perfectly repeatable, precise, multi-material objects with
    microscale accuracy. Originality/value – The paper constitutes a comprehensive
    review of physical voxel-based manufacturing and presents the groundwork for an
    emerging new field of additive manufacturing.

  abstract: Purpose – Digital materials are composed of many discrete voxels placed
    in a massively parallel layer deposition process, as opposed to continuous (analog)
    deposition techniques. The purpose of this paper is to explore the wide range
    of material properties attainable using a voxel-based freeform fabrication process,
    and demonstrate in simulation the versatility of fabricating with multiple materials
    in this manner. Design/methodology/approach – A representative interlocking voxel
    geometry was selected, and a nonlinear physics simulator was implemented to perform
    virtual tensile tests on blocks of assembled voxels of varying materials. Surface
    contact between tiles, plastic deformation of the individual voxels, and varying
    manufacturing precision were all modeled. Findings – By varying the precision,
    geometry, and material of the individual voxels, continuous control over the density,
    elastic modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, ductility, and failure mode
    of the material is obtained. Also, the effects of several hierarchical voxel “microstructures”
    are demonstrated, resulting in interesting properties such as negative Poisson’s
    ratio. Research limitations/implications – This analysis is a case study of a
    specific voxel geometry, which is representative of 2.5D interlocking shapes but
    not necessarily all types of interlocking voxels. Practical implications – The
    results imply that digital materials can exhibit widely varying and tunable properties
    in a single desktop fabrication process. Originality/value – The paper explores
    the vast potential of tunable materials, especially using the concept of voxel
    microstructure, applicable primarily to 3D voxel printers but also to other multi-material
    freeform fabrication processes.

    of this vast new design space using evolutionary algorithms. We first show a set
    of cantilever beams automatically designed to deflect in arbitrary static profiles
    using hard and soft materials. These beams were automatically fabricated, and
    their physical performance was confirmed within 0.5-7.6

    via a Thin Form-Factor Electrostatic Brake</span>'
  container-title: The 31st Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology
  page: 901-912
  abstract: Figure 1. DextrES is a flexible and thin form-factor haptic feedback mechanism
    for precise manipulation of virtual objects in VR and AR. a) Our approach provides
    kinesthetic feedback via electrostatic brakes and piezoelectric actuators for
    cutaneous feedback. b) We experimentally show that DextrES improves precision
    of virtual object manipulations in VR across c) a number of different types of
    grasps, each affording different hand poses. ABSTRACT We introduce DextrES, a
    flexible and wearable haptic glove which integrates both kinesthetic and cutaneous
    feedback in a thin and light form factor (weight is less than 8g). Our approach
    is based on an electrostatic clutch generating up to 20 N of holding force on
    each finger by modulating the electro-static attraction between flexible elastic
    metal strips to generate an electrically-controlled friction force. We harness
    the resulting braking force to rapidly render on-demand kines-thetic feedback.
    The electrostatic brake is mounted onto the the index finger and thumb via modular
    3D printed articulated guides which allow the metal strips to glide smoothly.
    Cuta-neous feedback is provided via piezo actuators at the fingertips. We demonstrate
    that our approach can provide rich hap-tic feedback under dexterous articulation
    of the user’s hands and provides effective haptic feedback across a variety of
    different grasps. A controlled experiment indicates that Dex-trES improves the
    grasping precision for different types of virtual objects. Finally, we report
    on results of a psycho-physical study which identifies discrimination thresholds
    for different levels of holding force. † Authors contributed equally to this work.

  abstract: This paper describes a miniature robot finger which uses shape memory
    alloy as the actuator. Aiming at developing robot hands to perform human work
    instead of men, numerous researches have been conducted. By miniaturizing robot
    hands, execution of more detailed work becomes possible. In developing miniature
    robot hands for dexterous manipulation, it is necessary to consider miniaturizing
    and simplification. The miniature robot finger proposed in this paper is driven
    by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. The structure of the robot finger imitates
    the musculoskeletal system of humans, since SMA wires exhibit nonlinear features
    similar to human muscles. Highly precise position control of fingertip is performable
    by using SMA owing to its shape memory effect. Force control of the fingertip
    is performed by measuring the tension of the SMA wire. We used strain gages to
    measure tension. We confirmed that stiffness control of the finger joint can be
    conducted by controlling tension of the SMA simultaneously.

  abstract: The history of aircraft structures underlies the history of aviation in
    general. Advances in materials and processes used to construct aircraft have led
    to their evolution from simple wood truss structures to the sleek aerodynamic
    flying machines of today. Combined with continuous powerplant development, the
    structures of " flying machines " have changed significantly. The key discovery
    that " lift " could be created by passing air over the top of a curved surface
    set the development of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft in motion. George Cayley
    developed an efficient cambered airfoil in the early 1800s, as well as successful
    manned gliders later in that century. He established the principles of flight,
    including the existence of lift, weight, thrust, and drag. It was Cayley who first
    stacked wings and created a tri-wing glider that flew a man in 1853.

  container-title: Journal of Medical Devices
  volume: '4'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: A unique, robust, robotic transtibial prosthesis with regenerative kinetics
    was successfully built and a 6-month human subject trial was conducted on one
    male below-the-knee amputee under linear walking conditions. This paper presents
    the quasistatic system modeling, DC motor and transmission modeling and analyses,
    design methodology, and model verification. It also outlines an approach to the
    design and development of a robotic transtibial prosthesis. The test data will
    show that the true power and energy requirement predicted in the modeling and
    analyses is in good agreement with the measured data, verifying that the approach
    satisfactorily captures the physical system. The modeling and analyses in this
    paper describes a process to determine an optimal combination of motors, springs,
    gearboxes, and rotary to linear transmissions to significantly minimize the power
    and energy consumption. This kinetic minimization allows the downsizing of the
    actuation system and the battery required for daily use to a self-portable level.

  abstract: Body undulation used by snakes and the physical architecture of a snake
    body may offer significant benefits over typical legged or wheeled locomotion
    designs in certain types of scenarios. A large number of research groups have
    developed snake-inspired robots to exploit these benefits. The purpose of this
    review is to report different types of snake-inspired robot designs and categorize
    them based on their main characteristics. For each category, we discuss their
    relative advantages and disadvantages. This review will assist in familiarizing
    a newcomer to the field with the existing designs and their distinguishing features.
    We hope that by studying existing robots, future designers will be able to create
    new designs by adopting features from successful robots. The review also summarizes
    the design challenges associated with the further advancement of the field and
    deploying snake-inspired robots in practice.

  abstract: The main contribution of the work is to develop an intelligent system
    for manufacturing features in the area of CAD/CAM. It brings the design and manufacturing
    phase together in design stage and provides an intelligent interface between design
    and manufacturing data by developing a library of features. The library is called
    manufacturing feature library which is linked with commercial CAD/CAM software
    package named Creo Elements/Pro by toolkit. Inside the library, manufacturing
    features are organised hierarchically. A systematic database system also have
    been developed and analysed for each feature consists of parameterised geometry,
    manufacturing information (including machine tool, cutting tools, cutting conditions,
    cutting fluids and recommended tolerances and surface finishing values, etc.),
    design limitations, functionality guidelines, and Design-for-manufacture guidelines.
    The approach has been applied in two case studies in which a rotational part (shaft)
    and a non-rotational part are designed through manufacturing features. Therefore,

  abstract: 'The field of evolutionary robotics has demonstrated the ability to automatically
    design the morphology and controller of simple physical robots through synthetic
    evolutionary processes. However, it is not clear if variation-based search processes
    can attain the complexity of design necessary for practical engineering of robots.
    Here, we demonstrate an automatic design system that produces complex robots by
    exploiting the principles of regularity, modularity, hierarchy, and reuse. These
    techniques are already established principles of scaling in engineering design
    and have been observed in nature, but have not been broadly used in artificial
    evolution. We gain these advantages through the use of a generative representation,
    which combines a programmatic representation with an algorithmic process that
    compiles the representation into a detailed construction plan. This approach is
    shown to have two benefits: it can reuse components in regular and hierarchical
    ways, providing a systematic way to create more complex modules from simpler ones;
    and the evolved representations can capture intrinsic properties of the design
    space, so that variations in the representations move through the design space
    more effectively than equivalent-sized changes in a nongenerative representation.
    Using this system, we demonstrate for the first time the evolution and construction
    of modular, three-dimensional, physically locomoting robots, comprising many more
    components than previous work on body-brain evolution.'

  abstract: An antagonistic muscle mechanism that regulates joint compliance contributes
    enormously to human dynamic locomotion. Antagonism is considered to be the key
    for realizing more than one locomotion mode. In this paper, we demonstrate how
    antagonistic pneumatic actuators can be utilized to achieve three dynamic locomotion
    modes (walking, jumping, and running) in a biped robot. Firstly, we discuss the
    contribution of joint compliance to dynamic locomotion, which highlights the importance
    of tunable compliance. Secondly, we introduce the design of a biped robot powered
    by antagonistic pneumatic actuators. Lastly, we apply simple feedforward controllers
    for realizing walking, jumping, and running and confirm the contribution of joint
    compliance to such multimodal dynamic locomotion. Based on the results, we can
    conclude that the antagonistic pneumatic actuators are superior candidates for
    constructing a human-like dynamic locomotor. 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

    relevant to worms, clams, and other higher organisms that rely on their digging
    ability for survival. In this article, we review recent work on the development
    of simple models that elucidate the fundamental principles underlying digging
    and burrowing strategies employed by biological systems. Four digging regimes
    are identified based on dimensionless digger size and the dimensionless inertial
    number. We select biological organisms to represent three of the four regimes:
    razor clams, sandfish, and nematodes. Models for all three diggers are derived
    and discussed, and analogies are drawn to low?Reynolds number swimmers.'

  abstract: Prototypes are widely recognized to be a core means of exploring and expressing
    designs for interactive computer artifacts. It is common practice to build prototypes
    in order to represent different states of an evolving design, and to explore options.
    How- ever, since interactive systems are complex, it may be difficult or impossible
    to create prototypes of a whole design in the formative stages of a project. Choosing
    the right kind of more focused prototype to build is an art in itself, and communicating
    its limited purposes to its various audiences is a critical aspect of its use.

    Biology'

  volume: 305A
  issue: '11'
  abstract: Are the different energy-conserving mechanics (i.e., pendulum and spring)
    used in different gaits reflected in differences in energetics and/or stride parameters?
    The analysis included published data from several species and new data from horses.
    When changing from pendulum to spring mechanics, there is a change in the slope
    of metabolic rate (MR) vs. speed in all species, in birds and quadrupeds there
    is no step increase, and in humans there are conflicting reports. At the trot-gallop
    transition, where quadrupeds are hypothesized to change from spring mechanics
    to some combination of spring and pendulum mechanics, there is a change in slope
    of MR vs. speed in horses but not in other species. Stride frequency (SF) is a
    logarithmic function of walking speed in all species, a linear function of trotting/running
    speed, and nearly independent of speed in galloping. In humans and horses there
    is a discontinuity in SF at the walk-trot (run) transition but not in birds. The
    slope of time of contact vs. speed does not change with mechanics in most species,
    but it does in humans. In horses and humans, there is a discontinuity at the walk-trot
    (run) transition and data for other species do not permit generalization. Duty
    factor (DF) in humans is greater than 0.5 in walking (pendulum mechanics) and
    less than 0.5 when running (spring mechanics). However, this is not true in many
    species that have DF\>0.5 at the lowest speeds where they use spring mechanics.
    When trotting at low speeds, horses use forelimb DF\>0.5 and hind limb DF\<0.5.
    Thus, it is confusing to distinguish between walking and running by DF.

  abstract: We propose a system for improving grasping using fingertip optical proximity
    sensors that allows us to perform online grasp adjustments to an initial grasp
    point without requiring premature object contact or regrasping strategies. We
    present novel optical proximity sensors that fit inside the fingertips of a Barrett
    Hand, and demonstrate their use alongside a probabilistic model for robustly combining
    sensor readings and a hierarchical reactive controller for improving grasps online.
    This system can be used to complement existing grasp planning algorithms, or be
    used in more interactive settings where a human indicates the location of objects.
    Finally, we perform a series of experiments using a Barrett hand equipped with
    our sensors to grasp a variety of common objects with mixed geometries and surface
    textures.

  abstract: In this paper, we solve the motion smoothing problem using genetic algorithms.
    Smooth motion generation is essential in the computer animation and virtual reality
    area. The motion of a rigid body in general consists of translation and orientation.
    The former is described by a space curve in three-dimensional Euclidean space
    while the latter is represented by a curve in the unit quaternion space. By adopting
    the geometric approach, the smoothness of both translation data and orientation
    data is measured from the strain energy perspective and a nonlinear optimization
    problem is formulated that aims to minimize the weighted sum of the strain-energy
    and the sum of the squared errors. A hybrid algorithm that combines genetic algorithms
    and local search schemes is deployed to solve this optimization problem and the
    experiments show that both smoothness and shape preservation of the resulting
    motion can be achieved by the proposed algorithm. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract: Nature selection has made today’s fish be beautiful swimmers with high
    efficiency and perfect manoeuvre abilities. To realise fish-like propulsion and
    manoeuvring abilities by a robotic system is a very challenging task and requires
    a fully understanding of fish muscle structure, hydrodynamics and the way to mimic.
    This paper overviews our current robotic fish research at Essex, which is focused
    on the biologically inspired design of autonomous robotic fish. Our efforts and
    experience on building a number of generations of robotic fishes to navigate in
    a 3D unstructured environment are described, including the successful launch of
    the 9th generation of our robotic fish in London Aquarium on 6 October 2005. Finally,
    a brief summary and the future research direction are outlined.

    of autonomous robotic fish that can swim in a 3D unstructured environment, based
    on observations of fish swim behaviours. Our robotic fish has a tail with three
    or four degrees of freedom (DOF) and is controlled by 4 onboard computers (a powerful
    Gumstix Linux PC and 3 PICs) and over 10 embedded sensors. Both simulated and
    the real fish experiments are conducted to show the feasibility and performance
    of the proposed approach. 2006 IEEE.

  abstract: This paper presents a numerical method for parameter synthesis of a central
    pattern generator (CPG) network to acquire desired locomotor patterns. The CPG
    network is modeled as a chain of unidirectionally or bidirectionally coupled Hopf
    oscillators with a novel coupling scheme that eliminates the influence of afferent
    signals on amplitude of the oscillator. The method converts the related CPG parameters
    into dynamic systems that evolve as part of the CPG network dynamics. The frequency,
    amplitude, and phase relations of teaching signals can be encoded by the CPG network
    with the proposed learning rules. The ability of the method to learn instructed
    locomotor pattern is proven with simulations. Application of the proposed method
    to online gait synthesis of a robotic fish is also presented.

  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics
  page: 1401-1410
  volume: '56'

  abstract: A new type of vision-based autonomous robotic fish capable of 3-D locomotion
    is developed in this paper. Based on our robotic fish prototype, the forces and
    moments acting on its fins and body are analyzed, and the governing motion equations
    are derived. We further investigate a decentralized control method in target-tracking
    and collision-avoidance task for two autonomous robotic fish. Most of previous
    work on the task strategies of autonomous robots is focused on terrestrial robots
    and seldom deals with underwater applications due to the uncertainties and complexity
    in a hydroenvironment. To address this challenge in such an underwater task, a
    situated-behavior-based decentralized control is employed on each robotic fish
    according to its visual data. On dealing with motion planning of the fish during
    target tracking and collision avoidance, a control law by a combination of an
    attractive force toward a target and a repulsive force for collision avoidance
    is utilized. Experimental results of the task performed by two autonomous robotic
    fish validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 2009 IEEE.

  abstract: Soft robots are primarily composed of soft materials that can allow for
    mechanically robust maneuvers that are not typically possible with conventional
    rigid robotic systems. However, owing to the current limitations in simulation,
    design and control of soft robots often involve a painstaking trial. With the
    ultimate goal of a computational framework for soft robotic engineering, here
    we introduce a numerical simulation tool for limbed soft robots that draws inspiration
    from discrete differential geometry based simulation of slender structures. The
    simulation incorporates an implicit treatment of the elasticity of the limbs,
    inelastic collision between a soft body and rigid surface, and unilateral contact
    and Coulombic friction with an uneven surface. The computational efficiency of
    the numerical method enables it to run faster than real-time on a desktop processor.
    Our experiments and simulations show quantitative agreement and indicate the potential
    role of predictive simulations for soft robot design.

  volume: '35'

  abstract: ATRIAS is a human-scale 3D-capable bipedal robot designed to mechanically
    embody the spring-mass model for dynamic walking and running. To help bring the
    extensive work on this theoretical model further into practice, we present the
    design and validation of a spring-mass robot that can operate in real-world settings
    (i.e. off-tether and without planarizing restraints). We outline the mechanisms
    and design choices necessary to meet these speciﬁcations, particularly ATRIAS’
    four-bar series-elastic leg design. We experimentally demonstrate the following
    robot capabilities, which are characteristics of the target model. 1) We present
    the robot’s physical capability for both grounded and aerial gaits, including
    planar walking and sustained hopping, while being more efﬁcient than similarly
    gait-versatile bipeds. 2) The robot can be controlled by enforcing quantities
    derived from the simpler spring-mass model, such as leg angles and leg forces.
    3) ATRIAS replicates the center-of-mass dynamics of human hopping and (novelly)
    walking, a key spring-mass model feature. Lastly, we present dynamically stable
    stepping in 3D without external support, demonstrating that this theoretical model
    has practical potential for real-world locomotion.

  abstract: The concept of isogeometric analysis is proposed. Basis functions generated
    from NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are employed to construct an exact
    geometric model. For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order
    elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite
    element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order
    concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact
    geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication
    with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics,
    it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine
    transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states
    are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical
    examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and
    convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown
    to converge toward monotone solutions for advection-diffusion processes with sharp
    internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric
    analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element
    analysis and possesses several advantages. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  page: '110'
  volume: '25'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: 'Many robots excel at precise positioning and trajectory tracking using
    software control, and most successful robotic applications utilize this ability-examples
    include CNC machining, robotic welding, painting, and pick-and-place circuit board
    assembly. The mechanical design of these robots focuses on rigid transmissions
    and minimizing compliance in the structure, so the software controller can accurately
    track a desired position as a function of time, regardless of any disturbance
    forces. However, there is a class of tasks for which rigid actuation is not ideal:
    physical interaction with the world, especially interaction that involves an impact
    or kinetic energy transfer. Animals tend to excel at these tasks, and far outperform
    the best robots. Examples include walking, running, catching a ball, gripping
    a piece of fruit firmly but without causing damage, and many types of assembly
    tasks. For dynamic behaviors such as running, the performance limitations of a
    robot are often due to limitations of the mechanical design. A robot is an integrated
    system of electronics, software, and mechanism, and each part of the system limits
    or enables the behavior of the whole. While some behaviors can easily be implemented
    through simple actuators and direct software control, a running machine requires
    mechanical design that is specialized for the task. Among other things, physical
    springs are essential for a robust and efficient running gait, to store energy,
    provide high mechanical power, and overcome bandwidth limitations of traditional
    actuators. An ideal kinematic design, where the joints and links are perfectly
    sized and placed for the desired task, and motors that exceed the force and speed
    requirements of the task are not sufficient for successful dynamic interactions.
    Inertia, transmission friction, and other dynamic effects have a significant role
    in the behavior of a robot. We are building running and walking machines with
    a focus on mechanical design to enable efficient and robust gaits. The defining
    characteristic of a running gait is spring-like behavior; all running animals,
    from small insects to large mammals, exhibit a center-of-mass motion that resembles
    a bouncing ball or a pogo stick. The spring-like behavior is implemented with
    the assistance of physical springy elements, such as tendons, and not entirely
    through software or neural control. Energy cycles back and forth between the ballistic
    trajectory of the body and the compression of the leg spring. To exhibit this
    behavior, our robots incorporate a mechanical spring that is tuned to absorb and
    release the energy of a running gait at the appropriate frequency. Electric motors
    act in series with this spring to add or remove energy from the cycle to modify
    or control the running gait. Our first prototype machine is a single actuator
    mounted to a bench, called the Actuator with Mechanically Adjustable Series Compliance,
    or AMASC. The stiffness and the no-load position of the joint are mechanical configurations
    that can be independently adjusted using two separate motors, and it is a test
    platform to verify and refine several design ideas for leg joints of running and
    walking robots. After significant testing and design, revision, we incorporated
    the ideas behind the AMASC into the design of a full bipedal robot, the Biped
    with Mechanically Adjustable Series Compliance, or BiMASC. A single leg prototype
    of the BiMASC was constructed and tested, and after some final revisions, we have
    built the Electric Cable Differential (ECD) Leg. The ECD Leg derives its name
    from the construction-using electric motors, cable drives, and mechanical differentials
    to actuate the system. One ECD Leg, named Thumper, is assembled as a monopod and
    installed in our laboratory at the Robotics Institute to study the role of compliance
    in running gaits. Two ECD Legs are assembled as a biped named MABEL, which is
    installed in Professor Jessy Grizzle’s Laboratory at the University of Michigan
    and will serve as a platform to explore novel control ideas. In this thesis, we
    demonstrate that physical springs are extremely important for supporting a running
    gait. Additionally, through experiments on the ECD Leg, we demonstrate that there
    is an energetically optimal leg stiffness. The design and construction of the
    robots in this thesis are an exploration of methods for adjusting the leg stiffness
    to obtain the optimal stiffness for a running gait. The AMASC and BiMASC utilize
    co-contraction of antagonistic springs to tune the stiffness to a desired value.
    The ECD leg, in contrast, utilizes both active control of the motor and kinematic
    adjustments to control the stiffness behavior of the leg. We suggest that that
    co-contraction of antagonistic springs is energetically expensive, and that active
    control of a leg to modify its inherent stiffness might be energetically cheaper,
    with the same functionality. The ECD leg successfully hopped in place, as well
    as at speed. Thumper and MABEL demonstrate, for the first time, a cable drive
    paired with series elasticity for a running machine. The AMASC is the first demonstration
    of series elasticity implemented via a mechanical differential, and the BIMASC,
    Thumper, and MABEL all utilize this same concept. The mechanical design of the
    ECD leg contains many novel ideas that will be utilized in future walking and
    running machines.'

  volume: '262'

  abstract: I used a simple mathematical model of the inverse dynamics of locomotion
    to estimate the minimum muscle masses required to maintain quasi-static equilibrium
    about the four main limb joints at mid-stance of fast running. Models of 10 extant
    taxa (a human, a kangaroo, two lizards, an alligator, and five birds) were analyzed
    in various bipedal poses to examine how anatomy, size, limb orientation, and other
    model parameters influence running ability. I examined how the muscle masses required
    for fast running compare to the muscle masses that are actually able to exert
    moments about the hip, knee, ankle, and toe joints, to see how support ability
    varies across the limb. I discuss the assumptions and limitations of the models,
    using sensitivity analysis to see how widely the results differed with feasible
    parameter input values. Even with a wide range of input values, the models validated
    the analysis procedure. Animals that are known to run bipedally were calculated
    as able to preserve quasi-static equilibrium about their hindlimb joints at mid-stance,
    whereas non-bipedal runners (iguanas and alligators) were recognized as having
    too little muscle mass to run quickly in bipedal poses. Thus, this modeling approach
    should be reliable for reconstructing running ability in extinct bipeds such as
    nonavian dinosaurs. The models also elucidated how key features are important
    for bipedal running capacity, such as limb orientation, muscle moment arms, muscle
    fascicle lengths, and body size. None of the animals modeled had extensor muscle
    masses acting about any one joint that were 7

  abstract: One of the milestones in tissue engineering has been the development of
    3D scaffolds that guide cells to form functional tissue. Recently, mouldless manufacturing
    techniques, known as solid free-form fabrication (SFF), or rapid prototyping,
    have been successfully used to fabricate complex scaffolds. Similarly, to achieve
    simultaneous addition of cells during the scaffold fabrication, novel robotic
    assembly and automated 3D cell encapsulation techniques are being developed. As
    a result of these technologies, tissue-engineered constructs can be prepared that
    contain a controlled spatial distribution of cells and growth factors, as well
    as engineered gradients of scaffold materials with a predicted microstructure.
    Here, we review the application, advancement and future directions of SFF techniques
    in the design and creation of scaffolds for use in clinically driven tissue engineering.

  container-title: International Journal of Robotics Research
  page: 1627-1650
  volume: '35'
  issue: '13'
  abstract: The Author(s) 2016.This paper presents a demonstration of the trot-to-gallop
    transition and subsequent stable gallop in a robotic quadruped. The MIT Cheetah
    I, a planar quadruped platform for high-speed running, achieves these tasks with
    a speed of 3.2 m/s (Froude number of 2.1) on a treadmill. The controller benefits
    from clues from biological findings and it incorporates (1) a gait pattern modulation
    that imposes predefined gait patterns with a proprioceptive touchdown feedback,
    (2) tunable equilibrium-point foot-end trajectories for four limbs that intentionally
    modulate ground reaction forces, and (3) programmable leg compliance that provides
    instantaneous reflexes to leg-ground interaction. An inertial measurement unit
    sensor is integrated with the controller in order to regulate leg angles of attack
    at touchdown. We reduce the dimension of the control parameters which describe
    temporal/spatial characteristics of quadruped locomotion, and the values are tuned
    via dynamic simulation and then experiment. Given a pre-defined virtual leg compliance
    and a desired angle of attack of legs, the equilibrium-point foot-end trajectories
    and phase relationships between four legs for stable trot and gallop gaits are
    found independently. We propose a simple throw-and-catch gait transition strategy
    which connects two stable limit cycles, the trot and the gallop, by linearly varying
    control parameters during the transition period. Successful gait transition is
    achieved in both simulation and experiment. Comprehensive analysis on the characteristics
    of the MIT Cheetah I experimental trot-to-gallop transition is provided. The phase
    portraits imply that stable limit cycles are achieved with the proposed controller
    in both trot and gallop, which enables the trot-to-gallop gait transition at high
    speed.

  volume: '33'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: 'The Author(s) 2014.This paper presents implementation of a highly dynamic
    running gait with a hierarchical controller on the MIT Cheetah. The developed
    controller enables high-speed running of up to 6m/s (Froude number of Fr ≈ 7.34)
    incorporating proprioceptive feedback and programmable virtual leg compliance
    of the MIT Cheetah. To achieve a stable and fast trot gait, we applied three control
    strategies: (a) programmable virtual leg compliance that provides instantaneous
    reflexes to external disturbance and facilitates the self-stabilizing shown in
    the passive dynamics of locomotion; (b) tunable stance-trajectory design, intended
    to adjust impulse at each foot-end in the stance phase in a high speed trot-running
    according to the equilibrium-point hypothesis; and (c) a gait-pattern modulation
    that imposes a desired cyclic gait-pattern taking cues from proprioceptive TD
    feedback. Based on three strategies, the controller is hierarchically structured.
    The control parameters for forward speeds, a specific gait-pattern, and desired
    leg trajectories are managed by a high-level controller. It consists of both a
    gait-pattern modulator with proprioceptive leg TD detection and a leg-trajectory
    generator using a Bèzier curve and a tunable amplitude sinusoidal wave. Instead
    of employing physical spring/dampers in the robot’s leg, the programmable virtual
    leg compliance is realized using proprioceptive impedance control in individual
    low-level leg controllers.To verify the developed controller, a robot dynamic
    simulator is constructed based on the model parameters of the MIT Cheetah. The
    controller parameters are tuned with the simulator to achieve self-stability,
    and then applied to the MIT Cheetah in an experimental environment. Using leg
    kinematics and applied motor current feedbacks, the MIT Cheetah achieved a stable
    trot-running gait in the sagittal plane.'

  page: 3101-3107
  abstract: This paper proposes a 3-D dynamic simulation of a previously developed
    basilisk lizard inspired quadruped robot, which is capable of locomotion on the
    surface of water. Using this 3-D simulation along with several 1-D and 2-D models,
    stability in terms of robot elevation from the water surface and robot rolling
    are examined. Analysis of the lifting force shows the robot is capable of running
    on water using viscous drag forces. Using this analysis, a criterion for convergence
    to a steady state distance from the water is presented. It is determined that
    7-12 Hz is an appropriate running frequency range for the robot to lift its weight.
    Compliant footpads are found to be beneficial in reducing the force associated
    with pulling out of the water. Further, from the roll motion analysis, previous
    designs result in instability along the roll axis. By comparing leg running frequency
    to the bodypsilas roll frequency, the minimum required roll moment of inertia
    for stable roll motion can be determined.

    including the operation to construct a 3D polygonal surface from a 2D silhouette
    drawn by the user: it inflates the region surrounded by the silhouette making
    wide areas fat, and narrow areas thin. Teddy, our prototype system, is implemented
    as a Java™ program, and the mesh construction is done in real-time on a standard
    PC. Our informal user study showed that a first-time user typically masters the
    operations within 10 minutes, and can construct interesting 3D models within minutes.'

  abstract: Conventional models of bipedal walking generally assume rigid body structures,
    while elastic material properties seem to play an essential role in nature. On
    the basis of a novel theoretical model of bipedal walking, this paper investigates
    a model of biped robot which makes use of minimum control and elastic passive
    joints inspired from the structures of biological systems. The model is evaluated
    in simulation and a physical robotic platform by analyzing the kinematics and
    ground reaction force. The experimental results show that, with a proper leg design
    of passive dynamics and elasticity, an attractor state of human-like walking gait
    patterns can be achieved through extremely simple control without sensory feedback.
    The detailed analysis also explains how the dynamic human-like gait can contribute
    to adaptive biped walking. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  container-title: IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems
  page: 2230-2235
  abstract: While underactuated robotic systems are capable of energy efficient and
    rapid dynamic behavior, we still do not fully understand how body dynamics can
    be actively used for adaptive behavior in complex unstructured environment. In
    particular, we can expect that the robotic systems could achieve high maneuverability
    by flexibly storing and releasing energy through the motor control of the physical
    interaction between the body and the environment. This paper presents a minimalistic
    optimization strategy of motor control policy for underactuated legged robotic
    systems. Based on a reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose an optimization
    scheme, with which the robot can exploit passive elasticity for hopping forward
    while maintaining the stability of locomotion process in the environment with
    a series of large changes of ground surface. We show a case study of a simple
    one-legged robot which consists of a servomotor and a passive elastic joint. The
    dynamics and learning performance of the robot model are tested in simulation,
    and then transferred the results to the real-world robot.

  abstract: The transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion was a key development
    in vertebrate evolution. We present a spinal cord model and its implementation
    in an amphibious salamander robot that demonstrates how a primitive neural circuit
    for swimming can be extended by phylogenetically more recent limb oscillatory
    centers to explain the ability of salamanders to switch between swimming and walking.
    The model suggests neural mechanisms for modulation of velocity, direction, and
    type of gait that are relevant for all tetrapods. It predicts that limb oscillatory
    centers have lower intrinsic frequencies than body oscillatory centers, and we
    present biological data supporting this.

  abstract: Close physical interaction between robots and humans is a particularly

    the robot must have the ability to adapt its behavior to the human counterpart.
    Based on our earlier work, we present and evaluate a computationally efficient
    machine learning algorithm that is well suited for such close-contact interaction
    scenarios. We show that this algorithm helps to improve the quality of the interaction
    between a robot and a human caregiver. To this end, we present two human-in-the-loop
    learning scenarios that are inspired by human parenting behavior, namely, an assisted
    standing-up task and an assisted walking task. 1994-2011 IEEE.

    robots: Series elastic actuation and parallel elastic actuation in comparison</span>'
  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 2477-2484
  abstract: 'A properly designed elastic actuation can increase the jumping height
    that a legged robot can reach. In this paper we compare the two most popular conceptual
    soft actuator designs, parallel elastic (PEA) and series elastic (SEA), in the
    task of maximizing the jumping height. Such task is translated into an optimal
    control problem. For a simplified version of the problem an analytical solution
    is provided, while a problem with more realistic constraints (e.g. the linear
    torque-speed motor characteristic is taken into account) is stated as a convex
    optimization problem and numerically solved. The results show that: (i) given
    the power of the motor there exists an optimal constant stiffness that maximizes
    the performance for both the SEA and the PEA; (ii) the optimal stiffness depends
    on the task terminal time, the inertial parameters of the system and the reduction
    ratio of the motor; (iii) in the condition considered the SEA behaves better than
    the PEA.'

  container-title: International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: 30-39
  volume: '81'
  abstract: RoboClam is a biomimetic burrowing robot that imitates the valve expansion/contraction
    digging pattern of the Atlantic razor clam, Ensis directus, to dig into submerged
    soil using an order of magnitude less energy than would be required to push into
    the soil with brute force. This paper examines whether it would theoretically
    be possible to use the same method to dig into dry soil. The stress state of the
    soil around the contracting robot was analyzed, and a target zero-stress state
    for dry soil digging was found. Then, the two possible modes of soil collapse
    were investigated and used to determine how quickly the robot would have to contract
    to achieve the target zero-stress state. It was found that for most dry soils,
    a RoboClam-like device would have to contract in 0.02 s, a speed slightly faster
    than the current robot is capable of, but still within the realm of possibility
    for a similar machine. These results suggest that the biomimetic approach successfully
    used by RoboClam to dig into submerged soil could feasibly be used to dig into
    dry soil as well.

  abstract: The number of tools for dynamics simulation has grown in the last years.
    It is necessary for the robotics community to have elements to ponder which of
    the available tools is the best for their research. As a complement to an objective
    and quantitative comparison, difficult to obtain since not all the tools are open-source,
    an element of evaluation is user feedback. With this goal in mind, we created
    an online survey about the use of dynamical simulation in robotics. This paper
    reports the analysis of the participants’ answers and a descriptive information
    fiche for the most relevant tools. We believe this report will be helpful for
    roboticists to choose the best simulation tool for their researches.

  page: 4452-4469
  volume: '6'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: The objective of articulating sustainability visions through modeling
    is to enhance the outcomes and process of visioning in order to successfully move
    the system toward a desired state. Models emphasize approaches to develop visions
    that are viable and resilient and are crafted to adhere to sustainability principles.
    This approach is largely assembled from visioning processes (resulting in descriptions
    of desirable future states generated from stakeholder values and preferences)
    and participatory modeling processes (resulting in systems-based representations
    of future states co-produced by experts and stakeholders). Vision modeling is
    distinct from normative scenarios and backcasting processes in that the structure
    and function of the future desirable state is explicitly articulated as a systems
    model. Crafting, representing and evaluating the future desirable state as a systems
    model in participatory settings is intended to support compliance with sustainability
    visioning quality criteria (visionary, sustainable, systemic, coherent, plausible,
    tangible, relevant, nuanced, motivational and shared) in order to develop rigorous
    and operationalizable visions. We provide two empirical examples to demonstrate
    the incorporation of vision modeling in research practice and education settings.
    In both settings, vision modeling was used to develop, represent, simulate and
    evaluate future desirable states. This allowed participants to better identify,
    explore and scrutinize sustainability solutions.

  page: 5830-5837
  volume: 2015-June

  abstract: Ocean sampling for highly temporal phenomena, such as harmful algal blooms,
    necessitates a vehicle capable of fast aerial travel interspersed with an aquatic
    means of acquiring in-situ measurements. Vehicle platforms with this capability
    have yet to be widely adopted by the oceanographic community. Several animal examples
    successfully make this aerial/aquatic transition using a flapping foil actuator,
    offering an existence proof for a viable vehicle design (Fig. 1).We discuss a
    preliminary realization of a flapping wing actuation system for use in both air
    and water. The wing employs an active in-line motion degree of freedom to generate
    the large force envelope necessary for propulsion in both fluid media. 2015 IEEE.

  container-title: International Journal of Technology and Design Education
  publisher: Springer Netherlands
  issue: '0123456789'
  abstract: 'Engineering career interest, especially that of young women, declines
    as they approach high-school graduation. We used expectancy-value theory, which
    emphasizes expectations for success and subjective value of experiences as antecedent
    factors to choice, as a framework for investigating new 9th grade soft robot design
    lessons. Compared to traditional robotics, the nature of soft robotics—materially
    embedded safety and an emerging technology with significant social implications—positions
    it to be favorable for growing students’ perceptions of success and value. To
    gauge the impact of the lessons following the first year of implementation, we
    use multilevel and ANOVA models to predict changes in three student perceptions
    following the lessons: self-efficacy (related to expectations of success), and
    situational motivation and career interest (both related to subjective value).
    Survey responses and demographic information were collected from 431 students,
    before and after both the soft robotics treatment lessons and the traditional
    robotics comparison lessons. Analysis of the results indicates that changes in
    perception were negligible for both lesson types and genders. These comparable
    findings between the lesson types indicate the feasibility of incorporating soft
    robotics into high-school classrooms. While not noticeably better, the soft robotics
    lessons expose students to an emerging field of engineering situated in a socially
    meaningful context that is theoretically aligned with career choices. Moreover,
    challenges that occurred during the first-year implementation suggest possible
    refinements which may improve students’ experiences and perceptions as our research
    continues.'

  abstract: This research paper evaluates student perceptual changes in engineering
    motivation and self-efficacy following participation in a soft robotics curriculum
    unit. Emerging from collaboration between researchers in the mechanical engineering
    department and technology and engineering education department at Purdue University,
    a novel design-based curriculum for student soft robot design has been pilot-tested
    at high schools this year. The present version of the curriculum materials is
    the result of previous years of pilot tests and refinement as we adapted laboratory
    procedures to a design- and inquiry-based lesson appropriate for classroom use.
    It is currently being implemented by seven high-school teachers using the Engineering
    byDesign curriculum. This paper will describe the rationale for the project and
    psychosocial factors underpinning the theorized utility of the experience for
    promoting student engineering self-efficacy and motivation. Following an overview
    of theory behind the curriculum, we describe how these principles align with the
    student experience while fabricating soft robots. Finally, we offer preliminary
    reports on initial states and changes in student perceptions as they participated
    in the curriculum.

  volume: '20'
  issue: 2-3
  abstract: Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) processes have demonstrated the ability
    to produce parts with locally controlled composition. In the limit, processes,
    such as three dimensional (3D) Printing can create parts with composition control
    on a length scale of 100 $\mu$m. To exploit this potential, new methods to model,
    exchange, and process parts with Local Composition Control need to be developed.
    An approach to modeling a part’s geometry, topology, and composition is presented.
    This approach is based on subdividing the solid model into sub-regions and associating
    analytic composition blending functions with each region. These blending functions
    define the composition throughout the model as mixtures of the primary materials
    avialable to the SFF machine. Design tools based upon distance functions are also
    introduced, such as the specification of composition as a function of the distance
    from the surface of a part. Finally, the role of design rules restricting maximum
    and minimum concentrations is discussed.

    Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
    have developed a robotic end effector intended to function as a general purpose
    research tool for the study of machine dexterity. The high performance, multifingered
    hand will provide two important capabilities. First, it will permit the experimental
    investigation of basic concepts in manipulation theory, control system design
    and tactile sensing. Second, it will expand understanding required for the future
    design of physical machinery and will serve as a "test bed" for the development
    of tactile sensing systems. The paper includes: 1) a discussion of issues important
    to the development of manipulation machines; 2) general comments regarding design

  abstract: The past several years have witnessed the emergence of a new world of
    nucleic-acid-based architectures with highly predictable and programmable self-assembly
    properties. For almost two decades, DNA has been the primary material for nucleic
    acid nanoconstruction. More recently, the dramatic increase in RNA structural
    information led to the development of RNA architectonics, the scientific study
    of the principles of RNA architecture with the aim of constructing RNA nanostructures
    of any arbitrary size and shape. The remarkable modularity and the distinct but
    complementary nature of RNA and DNA nanomaterials are revealed by the various
    self-assembly strategies that aim to achieve control of the arrangement of matter
    at a nanoscale level.

  abstract: Additive Manufacturing has become an efficient tool to study insect-inspired
    biomimetic solutions. Indeed, it can build objects with intricate 3D-shapes and
    use materials with specific properties, such as soft materials. From biomaterials
    to biostructures or biosensors, Additive Manufacturing allows more possibilities
    in terms of design and functions. Reciprocally, insect-inspired technological
    solutions can be implemented to enhance Additive Manufacturing processes providing
    for example biocompatible structures that can successfully host living cells.
    We believe that, thanks to its continuous progress, Additive Manufacturing will
    play a growing role in the development of insect-inspired solutions.

  abstract: 'Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists
    to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences.
    This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international
    tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted
    around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However,
    only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using
    SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the
    main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang.
    Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international
    tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly
    direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics
    and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified
    the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on
    socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly
    helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and
    Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion
    strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international
    tourists to travel long distances. Keywords:'

  page: 14663-14668
  volume: '111'
  issue: '41'
  abstract: We investigate the deployment of a thin elastic rod onto a rigid substrate
    and study the resulting coiling patterns. In our approach,we combine precision
    model experiments, scaling analyses, and computer simulations toward developing
    predictive understanding of the coiling process. Both cases of deposition onto
    static and moving substrates are considered. We construct phase diagrams for the
    possible coiling patterns and characterize them as a function of the geometric
    and material properties of the rod, as well as the height and relative speeds
    of deployment. The modes selected and their characteristic length scales are found
    to arise from a complex interplay between gravitational, bending, and twisting
    energies of the rod, coupled to the geometric nonlinearities intrinsic to the
    large deformations. We give particular emphasis to the first sinusoidal mode of
    instability, which we find to be consistent with a Hopf bifurcation, and analyze
    the meandering wavelength and amplitude. Throughout, we systematically vary natural
    curvature of the rod as a control parameter,which has a qualitative and quantitative
    effect on the pattern formation, above a critical value thatwedetermine. The universality
    conferred by the prominent role of geometry in the deformation modes of the rod
    suggests using the gained understanding as design guidelines, in the original
    applications that motivated the study.

  container-title: Smart Materials and Structures
  publisher: IOP Publishing
  volume: '27'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. Sensor fabrication for microrobots is challenging
    due to their small size and low mass. As a potential solution, we present a technique
    for estimating the velocity of piezoelectric bending bimorph actuators, a popular
    choice for driving such microscale devices, that requires simple electronics and
    no additional mechanical components. Our approach relies on the insight that motion
    of the actuators causes varying strains on the surface on the piezoelectric material,
    which via the direct piezoelectric effect, results in a current proportional to
    the actuator velocity. We propose that the actuator be electrically approximated
    as a parallel combination of a frequency and voltage dependent resistor and capacitor,
    and a velocity proportional current source. We develop an experimental procedure
    to measure these quantities, and are able to experimentally determine the actuator
    tip velocity to within 10

  abstract: Here we present HAMR-Jr, a 22.5 mm, 320 mg quadrupedal microrobot. With
    eight independently actuated degrees of freedom, HAMR-Jr is, to our knowledge,
    the most mechanically dexterous legged robot at its scale and is capable of high-speed
    locomotion (13.91 bodylengths$\sim$\^-1) at a variety of stride frequencies (1-200 Hz)
    using multiple gaits. We achieved this using a design and fabrication process
    that is flexible, allowing scaling with minimum changes to our workflow. We further
    characterized HAMR-Jr’s open-loop locomotion and compared it with the larger scale
    HAMR-VI microrobot to demonstrate the effectiveness of scaling laws in predicting
    running performance.

  page: 1372-1383
  volume: '20'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: In this paper, we study cohesive flocking and formation flocking of multiple
    robotic fish swimming in the water surface under the guidance of only one leader
    with zero-value external input. Combining consensus algorithms and attraction/repulsion
    functions, a distributed flocking algorithm is proposed for the robotic fish system
    to execute the cohesive flocking task. According to the LaSalle-Krasovskii invariance
    principle, the proposed algorithm enables followers to asymptotically track the
    leader’s velocity and approach the equilibrium distances with their neighbors,
    provided that the initial interaction network of the system is a leader-follower
    connected graph. Furthermore, by adding the information of a desired formation
    topology to the potential function term, the proposed algorithm can be extended
    to solve arbitrarily shaped formation flocking problem of multiple robotic fish.
    The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are effective
    for three robotic fish. Finally, several simulation examples are given to verify
    the functionality of the proposed approaches for a larger system with ten agents.

  page: 2922-2927
  abstract: Robotic manipulators for minimally invasive surgeries have traditionally
    been rigid, with a steerable end effector. While the rigidity of manipulators
    improve precision and controllability, it limits reachability and dexterity in
    constrained environments. Soft manipulators with controllable stiffness on the
    other hand, can be deployed in single port or natural orifice surgical applications
    to reach a wide range of areas inside the body, while being able to passively
    adapt to uncertain external forces, adapt the stiffness distribution to suit the
    kinematic and dynamic requirements of the task, and provide flexibility for configuration
    control. Here, we present the design of a snake-like laboratory made soft robot
    manipulator of 20 mm in average diameter, which can actuate, soften, or stiffen
    joints independently along the length of the manipulator by combining granular
    jamming with McKibben actuators. It presents a comprehensive study on the relative
    contributions of the granule size, material type, and membrane coupling on the
    range, profile, and variability of stiffness. 2012 IEEE.

  volume: '3'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Highly sensitive sensor arrays are in high demand for prospective applications
    in remote sensing and imaging. Measuring microscopic deflections of compliant
    micromembranes and cantilevers is developing into one of the most versatile approaches
    for thermal, acoustic and chemical sensing. Here, we report on an innovative fabrication
    of compliant nanocomposite membranes with nanoscale thickness showing extraordinary
    sensitivity and dynamic range, which makes them candidates for a new generation
    of membrane-based sensor arrays. These nanomembranes with a thickness of 25-70
    nm, which can be freely suspended over large (hundred micrometres) openings are
    fabricated with molecular precision by time-efficient, spin-assisted layer-by-layer
    assembly. They are designed as multilayered molecular composites made of a combination
    of polymeric monolayers and a metal nanoparticle intralayer. We demonstrate that
    these nanocomposite membranes possess unparalleled sensitivity and a unique autorecovering
    ability. The membrane nanostructure that is responsible for these outstanding
    properties combines multilayered polymer/nanoparticle organization, high polymer-chain
    orientation, and a pre-stretched state.

  abstract: Portable low-cost sensors and sensing systems for the identification and
    quantitative measurement of bacteria in field water are critical in preventing
    drinking water from being contaminated by bacteria. In this article, we reported
    the design, fabrication and testing of a low-cost, miniaturized and sensitive
    bacteria sensor based on electrical impedance spectroscopy method using a smartphone
    as the platform. Our design of microfluidics enabled the pre-concentration of
    the bacteria which lowered the detection limit to 10 bacterial cells per milliliter.
    We envision that our demonstrated smartphone-based sensing system will realize
    highly-sensitive and rapid in-field quantification of multiple species of bacteria
    and pathogens. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

    Robust and Adaptable Undulatory Locomotion</span>'
  container-title: IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems
  page: 5944-5951
  abstract: 'Continuum robots that move through undulatory actuation must be composed
    of body materials that can enable flexible movement yet also provide resistive
    forces to the surrounding fluid, granular, or solid environments. This need for
    ’f1exible-yet-stiff’ materials is notably important in robot designs that use
    passive propulsive elements such as tails and wings. Here we explore a laminate
    design paradigm for ’f1exible-yet-stiff’ robotic materials through sliding layer
    laminates (SLLs). We present design principles motivated by theory and experiment
    and illustrate a taxonomy of SLL enabled morphable materials capable of up to
    7 fold change in stiffness. Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of SLLs to
    undulatory continuum robots: a swimming robot with a passive tail. We target two
    desired robot locomotor behaviors: fast open water swimming, and steady swimming
    through narrow channels emulating underwater caverns and pipes. We demonstrate
    how tuning the stiffness of the robot tail maximizes thrust generation in these
    two locomotion modes. Soft tails are optimal in confined swimming because they
    generate short amplitude high wavenumber oscillations, while stiff tails in confined
    environments either collide with the walls or do not generate sufficient thrust.
    However, stiff tails are far better in unconfined environments which enable large
    stroke amplitudes requiring high stiffness. Through this demonstration we show
    that stiff or soft tail designs alone are incapable of effective locomotion in
    complex underwater environments challenge.'

  volume: '23'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: The morphology of a foldable kirigami structure with modified Miura-ori
    patterns, which displays curvature during motion, was investigated in this paper.
    The principle of spherical trigonometry was used to obtain the radius, span, rise,
    and longitudinal length of the foldable structure during motion. The results show
    that the radius of curvatures decreases and that the span initially increases
    and then decreases during the deployment process. Furthermore, there is little
    change in the span over the greater part of the deployment range. Changing the
    values for the length, a , and the vertex angle, $\beta$ , demonstrates that the
    deployment angle at the end of the motion, the span, and the maximal rise increase
    with the increase in the length a . However, changing these values has no effect
    on the longitudinal length. At the same time, the effect of the vertex angle $\beta$
    on the geometry of the foldable kirigami is not significant.

    Sequencing lies at the core of assembly planning, and variants include finding
    a feasible sequence-respecting the precedence constraints between the assembly

    criteria. The different ways of representing the space of feasible assembly sequences
    are described, as well as the search and optimization algorithms that can be used.
    Geometry plays a fundamental role in devising the precedence constraints between
    assembly operations, and this is the subject of the second part of the survey,
    which treats also motion in contact in the context of the actual performance of
    assembly operations. ?? 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

  abstract: In nature, fish has astonishing swimming ability after thousands years
    of evolution. To realise fish-like swimming behaviours by a robotic system poses
    tremendous challenges, especially for the C-shape turning (CST). This requires
    fully understanding of fish biomechanics and the way to mimic it. Based on observations
    of fish swimming, this paper presents a new kinematics model to mimic the CST
    behaviour in a robotic fish with a 4-DOF (degrees of freedom) tail. The simulated
    and the real experiments are conducted to show the theoretic feasibility. Both
    behaviour analyses and hydrodynamics features between the robotic fish and the
    real fish are presented to show the performance. 2005 IEEE.

  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 1603-1623
  volume: '202'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: Remarkable similarities in the vertical plane of forward motion exist
    among diverse legged runners. The effect of differences in posture may be reflected
    instead in maneuverability occurring in the horizontal plane. The maneuver we
    selected was turning during rapid running by the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis,
    a sprawled-postured arthropod. Executing a turn successfully involves at least
    two requirements. The animal’s mean heading (the direction of the mean velocity
    vector of the center of mass) must be deflected, and the animal’s body must rotate
    to keep the body axis aligned with the heading. We used two-dimensional kinematics
    to estimate net forces and rotational torques, and a photoelastic technique to
    estimate single-leg ground-reaction forces during turning. Stride frequencies
    and duty factors did not differ among legs during turning. The inside legs ended
    their steps closer to the body than during straight-ahead running, suggesting
    that they contributed to turning the body. However, the inside legs did not contribute
    forces or torques to turning the body, but actively pushed against the turn. Legs
    farther from the center of rotation on the outside of the turn contributed the
    majority of force and torque impulse which caused the body to turn. The dynamics
    of turning could not be predicted from kinematic measurements alone. To interpret
    the single-leg forces observed during turning, we have developed a general model
    that relates leg force production and leg position to turning performance. The
    model predicts that all legs could turn the body. Front legs can contribute most
    effectively to turning by producing forces nearly perpendicular to the heading,
    whereas middle and hind legs must produce additional force parallel to the heading.
    The force production necessary to turn required only minor alterations in the
    force hexapods generate during dynamically stable, straight-ahead locomotion.
    A consideration of maneuverability in the horizontal plane revealed that a sprawled-postured,
    hexapodal body design may provide exceptional performance with simplified control.

  abstract: In stakeholder meetings during an interaction design project, prototypes
    are commonly used for creating shared representations of design ideas. It can,
    however, be difficult for designers and meeting facilitators to know which prototyping
    technique to use. In this case study we compare user interface sketches, scenarios,
    and computer prototypes, and analyse video material from six stakeholder meetings.
    The scenario did not facilitate a focus on aesthetic or ethical perspectives,
    nor did it facilitate operational or perceptual issues. The prototype did not
    facilitate discussions on the overarching concept of the design, to the same extent
    as the sketches did, but it did facilitate operational issues. The sketches gave
    the broadest discussion. The groups also approached the design differently; for
    example, the system developers constantly returned to a constructional perspective.
    This means that the choice of prototyping technique should be made based on the
    composition of the group and the desired focus of the mee

  abstract: It is generally assumed that primary sensory neurons transmit information
    by their firing rates. However, during natural object manipulations, tactile information
    from the fingertips is used faster than can be readily explained by rate codes.
    Here we show that the relative timing of the first impulses elicited in individual
    units of ensembles of afferents reliably conveys information about the direction
    of fingertip force and the shape of the surface contacting the fingertip. The
    sequence in which different afferents initially discharge in response to mechanical
    fingertip events provides information about these events faster than the fastest
    possible rate code and fast enough to account for the use of tactile signals in
    natural manipulation.

  volume: '160'
  abstract: This essay explores how the properties of striated muscles are matched
    to the tasks they perform during running, swimming and flying. During exercise
    the major locomotory muscles undergo alternate cycles of lengthening and shortening.
    Force development is greatly influenced by the timing of stimulation in relation
    to the length-change cycle and by the nature of elastic structures connecting
    the muscle fibres to the skeleton. The storage and recovery of elastic strain
    energy by the tendons (apodema in insects) results in a considerable saving of
    metabolic energy. Strain is independent of locomotory frequency, body size and
    muscle temperature. In contrast, the frequency of cycles, and hence strain rate,
    generally increases with speed and is inversely proportional to body size. The
    maximum isometric stress (P0) striated muscles can exert is rather similar. During
    steady running or hopping in mammals the peak muscle stress is around one-third
    of P0. Behaviours such as vertical jumping impose higher stresses requiring disproportionately
    larger muscles and tendons, which may limit the storage of elastic strain energy.
    Muscles of small animals consume significantly more energy per gram than do those
    of large ones. This may be because they need to activate and deactivate their
    muscles at a higher rate to move at an equivalent speed. When differences in force
    production are normalised, by multiplying the energy consumed per stride by stride
    frequency, similar values for the mass-specific cost of locomotion are found in
    animals with different leg architectures, numbers of legs, skeletal type, body
    sizes and muscle temperatures.

  container-title: Proceeeding of the 2013 COMSOL Conference in Rotterdam
  abstract: 'Air damping can be detrimental to the performance of vibrating MEMS components.
    Quantitative evaluation of the damping is challenging due to the complex interaction
    of air with moving structures and typically requires numerical simulations. A
    full three-dimensional analysis can be computationally very expensive, time consuming
    and not feasible. Here, we present a simplified two-dimensional modeling of damping
    per unit length of selected MEMS structures. The simulated air damping results
    were compared with experimental measurements of corresponding piezoactuated resonators:
    in- plane and out-of-plane tuning forks, two types of out-of-plane cantilevers
    and a torsional micromirror. The applicability of the simplified model is verified
    by a good (2-30'

  volume: 2016-June
  abstract: 2016 IEEE. In this paper, we propose a trajectory-adjustable integrated
    milli-scale jumping-crawling robot with improved ability to overcome obstacles
    compared to a robot that can only crawl. The robot employs a novel jumping module
    with enhanced energy storing-capacity and a height-adjustable active trigger.
    To increase the energy-storing capacity, latex rubber and knee-like joints are
    employed to utilize large displacement of the elastic material. The active trigger
    is based on a single DC motor and can release stored energy at any state, enabling
    the robot to control the take-off speed of jumping. The jumping module is integrated
    with the lightweight Dash crawler. The integrated jumping-crawling robot weighs
    59.4 g and controls its moving trajectory by adjusting both its crawling speed
    and its jumping take-off speed.

  abstract: Numerous animals live in, and locomote through, subsea soils. To move
    in a medium dominated by frictional interactions, many of these animals have adopted
    unique burrowing strategies. This paper presents a burrowing model inspired by
    the Atlantic razor clam (Ensis directus), which uses deformations of its body
    to cyclically loosen and re-pack the surrounding soil in order to locally manipulate
    burrowing drag. The model reveals how an anisotropic body composed of a cylinder
    and sphere varying sinusoidally in size and relative displacement achieves unidirectional
    motion through a medium with variable frictional properties. This net displacement
    is attained even though the body kinematics are reciprocal and inertia of both
    the model organism and the surrounding medium are negligible. Our results indicate
    that body aspect ratio has a strong effect on burrowing velocity and efficiency,
    with a well-defined maximum for given kinematics and soil material properties.

  container-title: Bioinspiration & Biomimetics

  issue: '4'
  abstract: Unlike the falling cat, lizards can right themselves in mid-air by a swing
    of their large tails in one direction causing the body to rotate in the other.
    Here, we developed a new three-dimensional analytical model to investigate the
    effectiveness of tails as inertial appendages that change body orientation. We
    anchored our model using the morphological parameters of the flat-tailed house
    gecko Hemidactylus platyurus. The degree of roll in air righting and the amount
    of yaw in mid-air turning directly measured in house geckos matched the model’s
    results. Our model predicted an increase in body roll and turning as tails increase
    in length relative to the body. Tails that swung from a near orthogonal plane
    relative to the body (i.e. 0-30° from vertical) were the most effective at generating
    body roll, whereas tails operating at steeper angles (i.e. 45-60°) produced only
    half the rotation. To further test our analytical model’s predictions, we built
    a bio-inspired robot prototype. The robot reinforced how effective attitude control
    can be attained with simple movements of an inertial appendage.

  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States

  page: 4215-4219
  volume: '105'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: Geckos are nature’s elite climbers. Their remarkable climbing feats have
    been attributed to specialized feet with hairy toes that uncurl and peel in milliseconds.
    Here, we report that the secret to the gecko’s arboreal acrobatics includes an
    active tail. We examine the tail’s role during rapid climbing, aerial descent,
    and gliding. We show that a gecko’s tail functions as an emergency fifth leg to
    prevent falling during rapid climbing. A response initiated by slipping causes
    the tail tip to push against the vertical surface, thereby preventing pitch-back
    of the head and upper body. When pitch-back cannot be prevented, geckos avoid
    falling by placing their tail in a posture similar to a bicycle’s kickstand. Should
    a gecko fall with its back to the ground, a swing of its tail induces the most
    rapid, zero-angular momentum air-righting response yet measured. Once righted
    to a sprawled gliding posture, circular tail movements control yaw and pitch as
    the gecko descends. Our results suggest that large, active tails can function
    as effective control appendages. These results have provided biological inspiration
    for the design of an active tail on a climbing robot, and we anticipate their
    use in small, unmanned gliding vehicles and multisegment spacecraft.

  abstract: Humanoid robots demand high performance on actuators, such as power-to-weight
    ratio, durability, occupation volume, and freedom of placement. Also, for robots
    to interact with unknown objects, flexibility is necessary. Backdrivability is
    effective when both flexibility and high output torque needs to be realized, which
    were often contradicting requirement. In this paper, backdrivable hydrostatic
    transmission is proposed to satisfy requirements above. First, development of
    hydrostatic actuator including conditions of backdrivability is explained. Second
    design of backdrivable pump, hydraulic motor and manifold design is explained.
    Next, design of an anthropomorphic robot hand using developed hydrostatic transmission
    is discussed. Finally, developed hand is presented and experiments on backdrivability,
    force sensing, and grasping were performed.

  abstract: The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018. In the multimachine circumstances,
    it is difficult to analyze the steady state stability of each generator. In previous
    research, analysis of the steady state stability limit has been carried out but
    only look at the stability of the overall system. Therefore, to analyze the stability
    of each generator, the multimachine system must be changed into a Single Machine
    to Infinite Bus (SMIB) system by collecting all the loads into one central load
    in the infinite bus. The method to change from the multimachine system to SMIB
    system is presented in this paper. The multimachine system is converted into an
    equivalent impedance (req and xeq) and an equivalent load based on losses concept.
    After req and xeq is calculated, then by using steady state stability limit concept,
    the value of the maximum generation of each generator units can be determined.
    By means of maximum generation is the maximum output power limit that can be generated
    without causing unstability. ETAP simulation is used to validate the calculation
    results of the proposed method. The method was applied to units generator in Java
    Bali system 500 kV.

  volume: '10'
  issue: '85'
  abstract: We report a comprehensive scaling law and novel lift generation mechanisms
    relevant to the aerodynamic functions of structural flexibility in insect flight.
    Using a Navier-Stokes equation solver, fully coupled to a structural dynamics
    solver, we consider the hovering motion of a wing of insect size, in which the
    dynamics of fluid-structure interaction leads to passive wing rotation. Lift generated
    on the flexible wing scales with the relative shape deformation parameter, whereas
    the optimal lift is obtained when the wing deformation synchronizes with the imposed
    translation, consistent with previously reported observations for fruit flies
    and honeybees. Systematic comparisons with rigid wings illustrate that the nonlinear
    response in wing motion results in a greater peak angle compared with a simple
    harmonic motion, yielding higher lift. Moreover, the compliant wing streamlines
    its shape via camber deformation to mitigate the nonlinear lift-degrading wing-wake
    interaction to further enhance lift. These bioinspired aeroelastic mechanisms
    can be used in the development of flapping wing micro-robots.

  abstract: The modeling of fluid interactions around airfoils is difficult given
    the complicated, often non-symmetric geometries involved. The complex variable
    technique of conformal mapping is a useful intermediate step that allows for complicated
    airfoil flow problems to be solved as problems with simpler geometry. In this
    paper, we use the conformal mapping technique to model the fluid flow around the
    NACA 0012, 2215, and 4412 airfoils by using the Joukowsky transformation to link
    the flow solution for a cylinder to that of an airfoil. The flow around a cylinder
    was derived with the superposition of ele-mentary potential flows using an inviscid,
    incompressible fluid model. Lift calculations as a function of angle of attack
    for each airfoil were obtained using the transformed flow solutions and fundamental
    theories of aerodynamics. These calculations are compared against lift calculations
    provided by the thin airfoil method. Lift calculations for the NACA 0012 airfoil
    match well with expected results, while there is a discrepancy at low angles of
    attack for the 2215 and 4412 airfoils.

  abstract: 'PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to analyse the grip force distribution
    for different prosthetic hand designs and the human hand fulfilling a functional
    task. METHOD: A cylindrical object is held with a power grasp and the contact
    forces are measured at 20 defined positions. The distributions of contact forces
    in standard electric prostheses, in a experimental prosthesis with an adaptive
    grasp, and in human hands as a reference are analysed and compared. Additionally,
    the joint torques are calculated and compared. RESULTS: Contact forces of up to
    24.7 N are applied by the middle and distal phalanges of the index finger, middle
    finger, and thumb of standard prosthetic hands, whereas forces of up to 3.8 N
    are measured for human hands. The maximum contact forces measured in a prosthetic
    hand with an adaptive grasp are 4.7 N. The joint torques of human hands and the
    adaptive prosthesis are comparable. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of grip force distribution
    is proposed as an additional parameter to rate the performance of different prosthetic
    hand designs.'

  abstract: — This paper presents a novel manufacturing paradigm for constructing
    origami-inspired pop-up robots for future space exploration missions. The new
    approach uses a textile-enhanced rigid-flex printed circuit board (PCB) to implement
    a folding robot chassis using robust, spaceflight-tolerant materials, and integrates
    the robot electronics directly into the chassis for added compactness. The new
    approach also decouples the mechanical and electrical functions of the chassis
    flexures for improved kinematics and lifetime. This manufactur-ing paradigm was
    used to build PUFFER (Pop-Up Flat Folding Explorer Robot), a self-actuated pop-up
    rover being developed to provide a low-payload-cost mobility enhancement for future
    NASA missions.

  container-title: Robotica
  page: 2137-2155
  volume: '33'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Using simple running models, researchers have argued that swing-leg retraction
    can improve running robot performance. In this paper, we investigate whether this
    holds for a more realistic simulation model validated against a physical running
    robot. We find that swing-leg retraction can improve stability and disturbance
    rejection. Alternatively, swing-leg retraction can simultaneously reduce touchdown
    forces, slipping likelihood, and impact energy losses. Surprisingly, swing-leg
    retraction barely affected net energetic efficiency. The retraction rates at which
    these effects are the greatest are strongly model-dependent, suggesting that robot
    designers cannot always rely on simplified models to accurately predict such complex
    behaviors.

  abstract: This paper discusses hardware and software improvements to the RoboSimian
    system leading up to and during the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Finals.
    Team RoboSimian achieved a 5th place finish by achieving 7 points in 47:59 min.
    We present an architecture that was structured to be adaptable at the lowest level
    and repeatable at the highest level. The low-level adaptability was achieved by
    leveraging tactile measurements from force torque sensors in the wrist coupled
    with whole-body motion primitives. We use the term “behaviors” to conceptualize
    this low-level adaptability. Each behavior is a contact-triggered state machine
    that enables execution of short-order manipulation and mobility tasks autonomously.
    At a high level, we focused on a teach-and-repeat style of development by storing
    executed behaviors and navigation poses in an object/task frame for recall later.
    This enabled us to perform tasks with high repeatability on competition day while
    being robust to task differences from practice to execution.

  container-title: CAD Computer Aided Design
  page: 281-298
  volume: '34'
  abstract: 'When an object is made using Laminated Manufacturing (LM), the output
    is a rectangular block with the required object trapped inside. In order to enable
    extraction of the object, the remaining sheet in each layer is cut into square
    grids that grow into tiny tiles. Thus, the remaining stock inside and surrounding
    the object is in the form of tiled fragments. The operator ’decubes’ or removes
    these tiles using sharp tools and extracts the object. Making use of the remaining
    stock as support structure and grid cutting to enable extraction of the object
    are very innovative ideas in the ’paste-and-cut’ LM approach. However, this method
    is very inefficient for two reasons: firstly, cutting efficiency is poor since
    laser spends most of its time in grid cutting; secondly, decubing takes several
    hours. In this paper, an efficient method of cutting the remaining stock to extract
    the object is presented. Extraction of the object from the stock block has analogy
    with the extraction of casting from its mold - the present and proposed methods
    respectively being analogous to sand casting and permanent mold casting processes.
    In the proposed method, rather than fragmenting the remaining stock into tiny
    tiles, it is segmented into two stock halves that open about a parting surface
    of minimum area. This optimal parting surface is obtained for the convex hull
    of the object, rather than for the object itself, due to its complete visibility
    along any pair opposite directions. The convex hull is further segmented into
    the object and plugs. The plugs are so shaped that they do not get entangled inside
    the concave portions of the object. The plugs whose drawing directions coincide
    with the opening direction of the stock halves are merged with the corresponding
    stock halves. The object, all the plugs and both the stock halves form the stock
    block. All these pieces are made together in the LM machine. For disassembly,
    first the convex hull will be extracted by opening the stock halves. Subsequently
    the plugs that fill the concave portions of the object will be extracted from
    the convex hull. Thus, grid cutting and decubing are eliminated in the proposed
    method resulting in drastic reduction in prototyping time and improved quality
    of the prototype. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.'

  abstract: While CNC machining (subtractive method) is the only option when it comes
    to high quality components, it demands greater human intervention to generate
    the CNC programs, making it a slow and costly route. On the other hand, Rapid
    Prototyping (additive method) is able to convert the design into the physical
    objects without any human intervention. But its total automation comes with compromises
    in the qualities of geometry and material. A hybrid layered manufacturing process
    presented here combines the best features of both these approaches. In this process
    the near-net shape of the object is first built using weld-deposition; the near-net
    shape is then finish machined subsequently. Time and cost saving of this process
    can be attributed to reduction in NC programming effort and elimination of rough
    machining. It is envisioned as a low cost retro-fitment to any existing CNC machine
    for making metallic objects without disturbing its original functionalities. Near-net
    shape building and finish machining happening at the same station is the unique
    feature of this process. A customized software generates the NC program for near-net
    shape building. The intricate details of integrating arc welding unit with a CNC
    milling machine are presented in this paper. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  abstract: This paper reports on efforts by three Australian academics to develop
    students’ sociocultural awareness (in particular, their racial literacy) during
    a time of mounting pressure on teacher educators to narrow and standardise their
    approaches. The field of health education provides a vehicle for research; however,
    it is not the paper’s central foci. Of key concern is the development of a critical
    disposition in students–a disposition geared toward teaching for social equity.
    Learning of this nature transcends topic domains, and therefore allows for collaboration
    between academics in different parts of teacher education. Specifically, the paper
    focuses upon "whiteness" and applies a whiteness lens (a form of critical discourse
    analysis) to portions of the research data to explore how discourses of race circumscribe
    the efforts of white students and teachers, often resulting in unintentional "brushes"
    with whiteness (or reproductions of white race privilege). A collaborative approach
    that develops racial literacy through direct engagement with racial representations
    is considered as a way forward.

  container-title: Science Robotics
  page: eaar3449
  volume: '3'
  issue: '16'
  abstract: Closeup exploration of underwater life requires new forms of interaction,
    using biomimetic creatures that are capable of agile swimming maneuvers, equipped
    with cameras, and supported by remote human operation. Current robotic prototypes
    do not provide adequate platforms for studying marine life in their natural habitats.
    This work presents the design, fabrication, control, and oceanic testing of a
    soft robotic fish that can swim in three dimensions to continuously record the
    aquatic life it is following or engaging. Using a miniaturized acoustic communication
    module, a diver can direct the fish by sending commands such as speed, turning
    angle, and dynamic vertical diving. This work builds on previous generations of
    robotic fish that were restricted to one plane in shallow water and lacked remote
    control. Experimental results gathered from tests along coral reefs in the Pacific
    Ocean show that the robotic fish can successfully navigate around aquatic life
    at depths ranging from 0 to 18 meters. Furthermore, our robotic fish exhibits
    a lifelike undulating tail motion enabled by a soft robotic actuator design that
    can potentially facilitate a more natural integration into the ocean environment.
    We believe that our study advances beyond what is currently achievable using traditional
    thruster-based and tethered autonomous underwater vehicles, demonstrating methods
    that can be used in the future for studying the interactions of aquatic life and
    ocean dynamics.

  abstract: Advances in additive manufacturing enable fabrication of complex structures
    using functionally graded materials (FGMs) at a voxel level. Prior to developing
    voxel-based FGM designs using compatible dithering approaches, it is essential
    to first understand the basic principles of voxelbased digital composite designs.
    While several research studies exist regarding different representations of composition
    in voxel-based solid models, there is no extensive research on the material properties
    of voxel-based digital composite structures. This paper bridges this gap by investigating
    custom voxel-based designs of digital composite structures. The objective is to
    determine how the material properties of such structures are impacted by different
    voxel sizes using the material jetting process. In addition to the material properties,
    computational time taken to process different voxel sizes is analyzed. By doing
    so, we gain a better understanding of the relationship between material composition
    and voxel size in digital composite structures.

  abstract: The capability of Additive Manufacturing (AM) to manufacture multi-materials
    allows the fabrication of complex and multifunctional objects with heterogeneous
    material compositions and varying mechanical properties. The material jetting
    AM process specifically has the capability to manufacture multi-material structures
    with both rigid and flexible material properties. Existing research has investigated
    the fatigue properties of 3D printed multi-material specimens and shows that there
    is a weakness at multi-material interfaces. This paper seeks to, instead, investigate
    the effects of gradual material transitions on the fatigue life of 3D printed
    multi-material specimens. In order to examine the fatigue life at the multi-material
    interface, stepwise gradients are compared against continuous gradients created
    through voxel-based design. Results demonstrate the effects of different material
    gradient patterns and different material transition lengths on the fatigue life
    of multi-material specimens. In addition, the behavior of individual material
    composites is studied to confirm how gradient designs based on different material
    compositions affect their material properties.

  volume: '17'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: This paper reports a study of 66 upper limb amputees in County Funen,
    Denmark who were visited in their homes by the author. The purpose of the study
    was to evaluate the consumer concerns about their prostheses and to see if these
    were related to cessation of prosthetic use. It was also intended to estimate
    functional levels of both prosthetic users and non-users. The number of amputees
    investigated corresponds to the annual number of persons becoming upper limb amputees
    in Denmark. There were 3 prosthetic systems in use, two active systems and one
    passive system. At review there was a group of 18 amputees which did not use a
    prosthesis at all. It appeared that active and partially active users are younger
    persons with a relatively short time-lapse since amputation. Passive users are
    older persons with a long time-lapse since amputation. Only 4 out of 18 prosthetic
    non-users stopped prosthetic use as a consequence of prosthetic problems or discomfort.
    Active prostheses had the highest number of consumer problems. Most problems were
    concerned with the socket, and for the body powered prostheses also with the suspension
    and control system. It was shown that an awareness of the amputee’s working conditions
    is important at the fitting stage, especially the daily working situation. As
    a consequence strictly individual fitting is needed with attention being given
    to the manner in which the individual will use the prosthesis. This investigation
    clearly shows that active fitting is a worthy effort. In daily living the active
    users have a superior performance over the passive and non-users. It was observed
    that amputees despite many years of training still have problems with activities
    of daily living, particularly in relation to independent functions.

    structures</span>
  container-title: American Journal of Physics
  page: '599'
  volume: '72'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Nitinol wire is used to encode a three-dimensional structure in a linear
    chain. The folding of the structure progresses sequentially along the rigid wire
    from one end using only short-range forces. Three different shapes are constructed,
    an overhand pseudoknot, a protein structure with $\alpha$-helices, and a protein
    structure without $\alpha$-helices. The overhand pseudoknot was designed to be
    noncommutative so that forward folding along the chain results in the correct
    structure whereas reverse folding does not. The manipulation of nitinol wire structures
    leads to simple empirical rules for folding for noncommutative pseudoknots. Suggestions
    for additional noncommutative pseudoknot structures that can be designed both
    from wire and from DNA or RNA are given. The folding also can be accomplished
    using ordinary stiff wire. The folding of the wire provides an intuitive way to
    visualize sequential folding freed from a lattice.

  abstract: 'This paper examines the design of a parallel spring-loaded actuated linkage
    intended for dynamically dexterous legged robotics applications. Targeted at toe
    placement in the sagittal plane, the mechanism applies two direct-drive brushless
    dc motors to a symmetric five bar linkage arranged to power free tangential motion
    and compliant radial motion associated with running, leaping, and related agile
    locomotion behaviors. Whereas traditional leg design typically decouples the consideration
    of motor sizing, kinematics and compliance, we examine their conjoined influence
    on three key characteristics of the legged locomotion cycle: transducing battery
    energy to body energy during stance; mitigating collision losses upon toe touchdown;
    and storing and harvesting prior body energy in the spring during stance. This
    analysis leads to an unconventional design whose “knee” joint rides above the
    “hip” joint. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting mechanism can deliver
    more than half again as much kinetic energy to the body (or more than double the
    kinetic energy if the full workspace is used), and offers a five-fold increase
    in energy storage and collision efficiency relative to the conventional design.'

  abstract: Doubt has existed as to whether the tube feet of a starfish in locomotion
    act as a system of levers or whether they form a traction system, attaching to
    the substratum and contracting so as to pull the animal along. This problem has
    been investigated by recording the forces exerted by a single tube foot. The recording
    apparatus is described. It is shown that both lever and traction methods can be
    used according to circumstances. When the starfish is walking on a horizontal
    surface it is shown that the tube feet certainly act as struts and that they probably
    also act as levers. When the starfish is climbing upon a vertical surface (or
    meeting with resistance upon a horizontal surface) the tube feet attach themselves
    to the substratum and form a traction system.

  abstract: We present a micromanufacturing method for constructing microsystems,
    which we term ‘micro-masonry’ based on individual manipulation, influenced by
    strategies for deterministic materials assembly using advanced forms of transfer
    printing. Analogous to masonry in construction sites, micro-masonry consists of
    the preparation, manipulation, and binding of microscale units to assemble microcomponents
    and microsystems. In this paper, for the purpose of demonstration, we used microtipped
    elastomeric stamps as manipulators and built three dimensional silicon microstructures.
    Silicon units of varied shapes were fabricated in a suspended format on donors,
    retrieved, delivered, and placed on a target location on a receiver using microtipped
    stamps. Annealing of the assembled silicon units permanently bound them and completed
    the micro-masonry procedure.

    Rapid Prototyping of Laminate Robotic Mechanisms</span>
  container-title: 'Volume 5B: 42nd mechanisms and robotics conference'
  publisher: American Society of Mechanical Engineers
  page: V05BT07A068
  abstract: Laminate mechanisms are a reliable concept in producing lowcost robots
    for educational and commercial purposes. These mechanisms are produced using low-cost
    manufacturing techniques which have improved significantly during recent years
    and are more accessible to novices and hobbyists. However, iterating through the
    design space to come up with the best design for a robot is still a time consuming
    and rather expensive task and therefore, there is still a need for model-based
    analysis before manufacturing. Until now, there has been no integrated design
    and analysis software for laminate robots. This paper addresses some of the issues
    surrounding laminate analysis by introducing a companion to an existing laminate
    design tool that automates the generation of dynamic equations and produces simulation
    results via rendered plots and videos. We have validated the accuracy of the software
    by comparing the position, velocity and acceleration of the simulated mechanisms
    with the measurements taken from physical laminate prototypes using a motion capture
    system.

  abstract: We studied the effect of the control of an active spine versus a fixed

    led to faster locomotion, with less foot sliding on the ground, and a higher stability
    to go straight forward. However, we did no observe an improvement of cost of transport
    of the spine-actuated, faster robot system compared to the rigid spine.

    folds into the design. We present an optimization-based computational framework
    for design and digital reconstruction of surfaces which can be produced by curved
    folding. Our work not only contributes to applications in architecture and industrial
    design, but it also provides a new way to study the complex and largely unexplored
    phenomena arising in curved folding.

  volume: 2016-Novem
  abstract: 2016 IEEE. Many highly dynamic novel mobile robots have been developed
    being inspired by animals. In this study, we are inspired by a basilisk lizard’s
    ability to run and steer on water surface for a hexapedal robot. The robot has
    an active tail with a circular plate, which the robot rotates to steer on water.
    We dynamically modeled the platform and conducted simulations and experiments
    on steering locomotion with a bang-bang controller. The robot can steer on water
    by rotating the tail, and the controlled steering locomotion is stable. The dynamic
    modelling approximates the robot’s steering locomotion and the trends of the simulations
    and experiments are similar, although there are errors between the desired and
    actual angles. The robot’s maneuverability on water can be improved through further
    research.

    some climbing insects and spiders. This paper covers the analysis and implementation
    of the approach, focusing on issues of spine/surface interaction and compliant

    soft robotics and challenges are discussed.???Potential convergence between soft
    robotics and tissue engineering is introduced. Animals exploit soft structures
    to move effectively in complex natural environments. These capabilities have inspired
    robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. The goal
    is to endow robots with new, bioinspired capabilities that permit adaptive, flexible
    interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review emerging soft-bodied
    robotic systems, and in particular recent developments inspired by soft-bodied
    animals. Incorporating soft technologies can potentially reduce the mechanical
    and algorithmic complexity involved in robot design. Incorporating soft technologies
    will also expedite the evolution of robots that can safely interact with humans
    and natural environments. Finally, soft robotics technology can be combined with
    tissue engineering to create hybrid systems for medical applications. ?? 2013

  page: 382-395
  volume: '30'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: In robotic single-port surgery, it is desirable for a manipulator to exhibit
    the property of variable stiffness. Small-port incisions may require both high
    flexibility of the manipulator for safety purposes, as well as high structural
    stiffness for operational precision and high payload capability. This paper presents
    a new hyperredundant tubular manipulator with a variable neutral-line mechanisms
    and adjustable stiffness. A unique asymmetric arrangement of the tendons and the
    links realizes both articulation of the manipulator and continuous stiffness modulation.
    This asymmetric motion of the manipulator is compensated by a novel actuation
    mechanism without affecting its structural stiffness. The paper describes the
    basic mechanics of the variable neutral-line manipulator, and its stiffness characteristics.
    Simulation and experimental results verify the performance of the proposed mechanism.

  volume: '29'

  abstract: This paper presents a novel “layer jamming” mechanism that can achieve
    variable stiffness. The layer jamming mechanism exploits the friction present
    between layers of thin material, which can be controlled by a confining pressure.
    Due to the mechanism’s hollow geometry, compact size, and light weight, it is
    well suited for various minimally invasive surgery applications, where stiffness
    change is required. This paper describes the concept, the mathematical model,
    and a tubular snake-like manipulator prototype. Various characteristics of layer
    jamming, such as stiffness and yield strength, are studied both theoretically
    and experimentally.

  abstract: A small mobile robot that uses round wheels has a stable ride ability
    on flat surfaces, but the robot cannot climb an obstacle whose height is greater
    than the length of its wheel radius. As an alternative, legged-wheel robots have
    been proposed for their better climbing performance. However, such legged-wheel
    robots have a poor driving performance on flat surfaces since their center of
    mass is vertically changed. Transformable wheels are used to make the robot drive
    with round wheels on flat surfaces and climb an obstacle with legged-wheels. However,
    the design of previously developed transformable wheels is complicated because
    it needs actuators for the transformation. Thus, it is not suitable for small
    robots. In this paper, a simple robot platform called Wheel Transformer that uses
    a new kind of transformable wheel is described. The transformation process is
    passively operated by an external frictional force, so it does not need any actuators.
    We fabricate the transformable wheel as well as the robot platform based on analysis
    of transformation mechanism. The robot can climb an obstacle whose height is 2.6
    times greater than its wheel radius.

  abstract: Orientation by an animal inhabiting an underground environment must be
    extremely efficient if it is to contend effectively with the high energetic costs
    of excavating soil for a tunnel system. We examined, in the field, the ability
    of a fossorial rodent, the blind mole-rat, Spalax ehrenbergi, to detour different
    types of obstacles blocking its tunnel and rejoin the disconnected tunnel section.
    To create obstacles, we dug ditches, which we either left open or filled with
    stone or wood. Most (77

    crumpling as distinct symmetry-breaking instabilities</span>
  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: 9716-9720
  volume: '109'
  issue: '25'
  abstract: Smooth wrinkles and sharply crumpled regions are familiar motifs in biological
    or synthetic sheets, such as rapidly growing plant leaves and crushed foils. Previous
    studies have addressed both morphological types, but the generic route whereby
    a featureless sheet develops a complex shape remains elusive. Here we show that
    this route proceeds through an unusual sequence of distinct symmetry-breaking
    instabilities. The object of our study is an ultrathin circular sheet stretched
    over a liquid drop. As the curvature is gradually increased, the surface tension
    stretching the sheet over the drop causes compression along circles of latitude.
    The compression is relieved first by a transition into a wrinkle pattern, and
    then into a crumpled state via a continuous transition. Our data provide conclusive
    evidence that wrinkle patterns in highly bendable sheets are not described by
    classical buckling methods, but rather by a theory which assumes that wrinkles
    completely relax the compressive stress. With this understanding we recognize
    the observed sequence of transitions as distinct symmetry breakings of the shape
    and the stress field. The axial symmetry of the shape is broken upon wrinkling
    but the underlying stress field preserves this symmetry. Thus, the wrinkle-to-crumple
    transition marks symmetry-breaking of the stress in highly bendable sheets. By
    contrast, other instabilities of sheets, such as blistering and cracking, break
    the homogeneity of shape and stress simultaneously. The onset of crumpling occurs
    when the wrinkle pattern grows to half the sheet’s radius, suggesting a geometric,
    material-independent origin for this transition.

  issue: January 2008
  abstract: Collecting user input is important for many aspects of the design process,
    and includes techniques ranging from informal user surveys to rigorous laboratory
    studies. However, the costs involved in engaging users for evaluation often requires
    practitioners to trade off between sample sizes, time requirements, and monetary
    costs. Micro-task markets, such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, offer a potential
    paradigm for engaging a large number of users for low time and monetary costs.
    Here we investigate the utility of a micro-task market for collecting user input
    and measurements, and discuss design considerations for developing remote micro
    user evaluation tasks. Although micro-task markets have great potential for rapidly
    collecting user measurements at low costs, we found that special care is needed
    in formulating tasks in order to harness the capabilities of the approach.

    II. Activity during walking and influences on leg coordination</span>
  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 161-175
  volume: VOL. 122
  abstract: 1\. When a crayfish walks forward, its legs are not loaded equally. The
    third pair is the one exerting the largest vertically directed force, and the
    fourth legs produce the major part of the propulsive force. 2. Chronic recordings
    from a CSD2 nerve were made in crayfish walking on a treadmill. The activity of
    CSD2 rises during the stance phase. The activity peak at the beginning of the
    power stroke is especially pronounced in leg 4, which was studied in detail. The
    average spike frequency of CSD2 recordings during the first part of the power
    stroke is positively correlated with the initial increase in force produced by
    the leg. This suggests that CSD2 responds especially well to rapid load changes.
    3. When a wire was fixed around a fourth leg such that it depressed the patch
    of compliant cuticle associated with CSD2, the activity of the sense organ was
    elevated throughout the entire step cycle, and the time between leg 4 touching
    the ground and leg 3 lifting off was more variable than in normal walking. Thus,
    CSD2 seems to be involved in the coordination of the walking legs. 4. Depressing
    the compliant cuticle of CSD2 elicits reflexes in the flexor muscle and the anterior
    levator in tethered crayfish. Interleg reflexes were not found.

  volume: '19'

  abstract: 'Our two experiments investigated associations between cognitive representations
    of objects and hand-shape categories. Hand configurations were partitioned according
    to prehensility and the size of the contacting surface, resulting in the classes:
    pinch, poke, palm, and clench. Experiment 1 elicited object names in response
    to configuration-name cues, provided ratings of the relevance of each configuration
    to a set of objects, and probed for the functions determining such relevance.
    Cueing with a configuration class elicited an associated object category with
    substantial intersubject agreement, and vice versa. Both the object categories
    and the functions associated with the four hand-configuration classes differed
    substantially, although the same object could be associated to some extent with
    multiple configurations, given variations in function. Experiment 2 elicited the
    names of hand-configuration classes in response to unfamiliar forms, which varied
    systematically in depth and the size of the projecting picture-plane surface.
    The modal response, response time, and degree of intersubject agreement were directly
    related to these variables. These structural variables, however, did not adequately
    predict shaping responses to real objects, as ascertained from Experiment 1. The
    results have implications for cognitive representation of motor categories and
    hand shaping in response to objects.'

  abstract: '2015 IEEE. Controlling the robot with a permanently-updated optimal trajectory,
    also known as model predictive control, is the Holy Grail of whole-body motion
    generation. Before obtaining it, several challenges should be faced: computation
    cost, non-linear local minima, algorithm stability, etc. In this paper, we address
    the problem of applying the updated optimal control in real-time on the physical
    robot. In particular, we focus on the problems raised by the delays due to computation
    and by the differences between the real robot and the simulated model. Based on
    the optimal-control solver MuJoCo, we implemented a complete model-predictive
    controller and we applied it in real-time on the physical HRP-2 robot. It is the
    first time that such a whole-body model predictive controller is applied in real-time
    on a complex dynamic robot. Aside from the technical contributions cited above,
    the main contribution of this paper is to report the experimental results of this
    première implementation.'

  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 3299-3306
  abstract: For maximum maneuverability, terrestrial robots need to be able to turn
    precisely, quickly, and with a small radius. Previous efforts at turning in legged
    robots primarily have used leg force or velocity modulation. We developed a palm-sized
    legged robot, called TAYLRoACH. The tailed robot was able to make rapid, precise
    turns using only the actuation of a tail appendage. By rapidly rotating the tail
    as the robot runs forward, the robot was able to make sudden 90° turns at 360
    °s-1. Unlike other robots, this is done with almost no change in its running speed.
    We have also modeled the dynamics of this maneuver, to examine how features, such
    as tail length and mass, affect the robot’s turning ability. This approach has
    produced turns with a radius of 0.4 body lengths at 3.2 body lengths per second
    running speed. Using gyro feedback and bang-bang control, we achieve an accuracy
    of ± 5° for a 60° turn.

  title: EFFECT OF INERTIAL TAIL ON YAW RATE OF 45 GRAM LEGGED ROBOT
  container-title: Adaptive mobile robotics
  publisher: WORLD SCIENTIFIC
  page: 157-164
  abstract: Small legged robots have unique potential for widespread application in
    search and rescue, hazardous exploration, battlefield reconnaissance, and almost
    any remote, inaccessible or dangerous situation not reachable by humans. Dynamic
    running robots have used a variety of steering means, including differential velocity
    drive \[1\]\[2\] and actively changing leg kinematics \[3\]\[4\]. Previous robots
    have also used tails for various functions, such as turning in an aquatic environment
    \[5\], active pitch control \[6\]\[7\], or stabilization during climbing \[8\].
    The robot discussed here uses a tail to produce a turn on rough or flat ground.
    This paper examines the way in which this is done, through the use of angular
    momentum exchange and internal impacts that generate a turning impulse.

  publisher: IEEE
  page: 1209-1214
  abstract: This paper presents the design and control of an actuated bivalve robot,
    which has been developed to study the burrowing locomotion of bivalves in sediment.
    The setup consists of a tank filled with sand and water, plastic models of bivalve
    shells capable of expelling water and an external actuation mechanism simulating
    the rocking burrowing motion typically used by these animals. The realistic shell
    shapes have been realized using three-dimensional plotting techniques allowing
    testing influences of different shell shapes and surface structures (sculptures)
    on the burrowing efficiency. Based on the experimental setup, the burrowing process
    has been reproduced. The results show that this setup can be used to identify
    correlations in the burrowing process. Further experimental work will investigate
    the influence of factors such as shell shape and sculpture or the motion sequence
    on the burrowing performance.

  container-title: Applied Soft Computing
  page: 189-202
  volume: '7'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Evolutionary Robotics (ER) is one of promising approaches to design robot
    controllers which essentially have complicated and/or complex properties. In most
    ER research, the sensory - motor mappings of robots are represented as artificial
    neural networks, and their connection weights ( and sometimes the structure of
    the networks) can be optimized in the parameter spaces by using evolutionary computation.
    However, generally, the evolved neural controllers could be fragile in unexperienced
    environments, especially in real worlds, because the evolutionary optimization
    processes would be executed in idealized simulators. This is known as the gap
    problem between the simulated and real worlds. To overcome this, the author focused
    on evolving an on-line learning ability instead of weight parameters in a simulated
    environment. According to recent biological findings, actually, the kinds of on-line
    adaptation abilities can be found in real nervous systems of insects and crustaceans,
    and it is also known that a variety of neuromodulators (NMs) play crucial roles
    to regulate the network characteristics (i.e. activating/ blocking/changing of
    synaptic connections). Based on this, a neuromodulatory neural network model was
    proposed and it was utilized as a mobile robot controller. In the paper, the detail
    behavior analysis of the evolved neuromodulatory neural network is also discussed.

  page: 5857-5862
  abstract: In this paper we present an open-source design for the development of
    low-complexity, anthropomorphic, underactuated robot hands with a selectively
    lockable differential mechanism. The differential mechanism used is a variation
    of the whiffletree (or seesaw) mechanism, which introduces a set of locking buttons
    that can block the motion of each finger. The proposed design is unique since
    with a single motor and the proposed differential mechanism the user is able to
    control each finger independently and switch between different grasping postures
    in an intuitive manner. Anthropomorphism of robot structure and motion is achieved
    by employing in the design process an index of anthropomorphism. The proposed
    robot hands can be easily fabricated using low-cost, off-the-shelf materials and
    rapid prototyping techniques. The efficacy of the proposed design is validated
    through different experimental paradigms involving grasping of everyday life objects
    and execution of daily life activities. The proposed hands can be used as affordable
    prostheses, helping amputees regain their lost dexterity.

  abstract: Multicopters stand to revolutionize parcel delivery because of their capability
    to operate in areas with unsuitable road infrastructure and precisely maneuver
    in cluttered environments. However, current multicopters for delivery can be dangerous
    for people, and are difficult to store and transport. Safety issues arise because
    users are exposed to unshielded spinning propellers. Transportation to the place
    of deployment and storage is often impaired by the large size that is required
    for heavy lifting. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing the integration
    of a quadcopter into a foldable protective cage. The cage provides an all-round

  abstract: Many new robotic and teleoperated applications require a high degree of
    mobility or dexterity that is difficult to achieve with current actuator technology.
    Natural muscle is an actuator that has many features, including high energy density,
    fast speed of response, and large stroke, that are desirable for such applications.
    The electrostriction of polymer dielectrics with compliant electrodes can be used
    in electrically controllable, muscle-like actuators. These electrostrictive polymer
    artificial muscle (EPAM) actuators can produce strains of up to 30

    of heterogeneous objects are investigated. Vigorous heterogeneous object representations
    are roughly classified into three major categories: evaluated models, unevaluated
    models and composite models. We reveal their similarities and study their strengths
    and weaknesses in terms of the representational capacities, intuitiveness, exactness,
    compactness, efficiency and other criteria. Different design paradigms are briefly

    present the development and characterization of a novel 5 cm, 7g jumping robot.
    It can jump obstacles more than 27 times its own size and outperforms existing
    jumping robots by one order of magnitude with respect to jump height per weight
    and jump height per size. It employs elastic elements in a four bar linkage leg
    system to allow for very powerful jumps and adjustment of the jumping force, take-off
    angle and force profile during the acceleration phase.

  abstract: In nature, many animals are able to jump, upright themselves after landing
    and jump again. This allows them to move in unstructured and rough terrain. As
    a further development of our previously presented 7 g jumping robot, we consider
    various mechanisms enabling it to recover and upright after landing and jump again.
    After a weighted evaluation of these different solutions, we present a spherical
    system with a mass of 9.8 g and a diameter of 12 cm that is able to jump, upright
    itself after landing and jump again. In order to do so autonomously, it has a
    control unit and sensors to detect its orientation and spring charging state.
    With its current configuration it can overcome obstacles of 76 cm at a take-off
    angle of 75.

  volume: '6'

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The energy that animals devote to locomotion has been of
    intense interest to biologists for decades and two basic methodologies have emerged
    to predict locomotor energy expenditure: those based on metabolic and those based
    on mechanical energy. Metabolic energy approaches share the perspective that prediction
    of locomotor energy expenditure should be based on statistically significant proxies
    of metabolic function, while mechanical energy approaches, which derive from many
    different perspectives, focus on quantifying the energy of movement. Some controversy
    exists as to which mechanical perspective is "best", but from first principles
    all mechanical methods should be equivalent if the inputs to the simulation are
    of similar quality. Our goals in this paper are 1) to establish the degree to
    which the various methods of calculating mechanical energy are correlated, and
    2) to investigate to what degree the prediction methods explain the variation
    in energy expenditure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We use modern humans as
    the model organism in this experiment because their data are readily attainable,
    but the methodology is appropriate for use in other species. Volumetric oxygen
    consumption and kinematic and kinetic data were collected on 8 adults while walking
    at their self-selected slow, normal and fast velocities. Using hierarchical statistical
    modeling via ordinary least squares and maximum likelihood techniques, the predictive
    ability of several metabolic and mechanical approaches were assessed. We found
    that all approaches are correlated and that the mechanical approaches explain
    similar amounts of the variation in metabolic energy expenditure. Most methods
    predict the variation within an individual well, but are poor at accounting for
    variation between individuals. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the choice
    of predictive method is dependent on the question(s) of interest and the data
    available for use as inputs. Although we used modern humans as our model organism,
    these results can be extended to other species.'

    Sciences'
  page: 849-861
  volume: '354'
  issue: '1385'
  abstract: To explore the role of the mechanical system in control, we designed a
    two-dimensional, feed-forward, dynamic model of a hexapedal runner (death-head
    cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis). We chose to model many-legged, sprawled posture
    animals because of their remarkable stability. Since sprawled posture animals
    operate more in the horizontal plane than animals with upright postures, we decoupled
    the vertical and horizontal plane and only modelled the horizontal plane. The
    model was feed-forward with no equivalent of neural feedback among any of the
    components. The model was stable and its forward, lateral and rotational velocities
    were similar to that measured in the animal at its preferred velocity. It also
    self-stabilized to velocity perturbations. The rate of recovery depended on the
    type of perturbation. Recovery from rotational velocity perturbations occurred
    within one step, whereas recovery from lateral perturbations took multiple strides.
    Recovery from fore-aft velocity perturbations was the slowest. Perturbations were
    dynamically coupled - alterations in one velocity component necessarily perturbed
    the others. Perturbations altered the translation and/or rotation of the body
    which consequently provided ’mechanical feedback’ by altering leg moment arms.
    Self-stabilization by the mechanical system can assist in making the neural contribution
    of control simpler.

  container-title: Progress in Aerospace Sciences
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: 33-55
  volume: '63'
  abstract: 'Morphing, understood as the ability to undergo pronounced shape adaptations
    to optimally respond to a diversity of operational conditions, has been singled
    out as a future direction in the pursuit of maximised efficiency of lightweight
    structures. Whereas a certain degree of adaptivity can be accomplished conventionally
    by means of mechanical systems, compliance allowing for substantial reversible
    deformability exhibits far more potential as a morphing strategy. A promising
    solution to the inherent contradiction between high stiffness and reversible deformation
    capacity posed by morphing is offered by introducing variable stiffness components.
    This notion indicates the provision of a controllable range of deformation resistance
    levels in place of fixed properties, as required by real-time shape adaptation
    dictated by maximum efficiency under changing external conditions. With special
    emphasis on the morphing context, the current review aims to identify the main
    tendencies, undertaking a systematic classification of existing approaches involving
    stiffness variability. Four broad categories in which variable stiffness has been
    applied to morphing are therefore distinguished and detailed: material engineering,
    active mechanical design, semi-active techniques and elastic structural behaviour.
    Adopting a wide perspective, the study highlights key capabilities, limitations
    and challenges. The need for attention directed to the variable stiffness strategy
    is recognised and the significance of intensive research activities in a highly
    integrated and multidisciplinary environment emphasised if higher maturity stages
    of the concepts are to be reached. Finally, the potential of emerging directions
    of semi-active design involving electro-bonded laminates and multi-stable structures
    is brought into focus. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.'

  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 2589-2594
  abstract: We describe a whole-body dynamic walking controller implemented as a convex
    quadratic program. The controller solves an optimal control problem using an approximate
    value function derived from a simple walking model while respecting the dynamic,
    input, and contact constraints of the full robot dynamics. By exploiting sparsity
    and temporal structure in the optimization with a custom active-set algorithm,
    we surpass the performance of the best available off-the-shelf solvers and achieve
    1kHz control rates for a 34-DOF humanoid. We describe applications to balancing
    and walking tasks using the simulated Atlas robot in the DARPA Virtual Robotics
    Challenge.

  container-title: 'Proceedings - SCF 2017: ACM Symposium on Computational Fabrication'
  abstract: 'This work presents halftoning techniques to manufacture 3D objects with
    the appearance of full grayscale imagery for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers.
    While droplet-based dithering is a common halftoning technique, this is not applicable
    to FDM printing, since FDM builds up objects by extruding material in semi-continuous
    paths. A set of three methods is presented which apply a linear halftoning principle
    called ’hatching’ to horizontal, vertical and diagonal surfaces. These methods
    are better suited to FDM compared to other halftoning methods: their applicability
    stands irrespective of the geometry and surface slope and the perceived tone is
    less sensitive to the viewing angle. Furthermore, the methods have little effect
    on printing time. Experiments on a dual-nozzle FDM printer show promising results.
    Future work is required to optimize the interaction between the presented methods.'

  page: 336-345
  abstract: Currently, solid modeling techniques are capable of capturing only the
    geometric and topological information of an object. However, there is a growing
    need for including additional information (such as material) in the solid model.
    Our focus application is Layered Manufacturing (LM), a process which is capable
    of fabricating a part made of several materials. In this paper, we present an
    approach to model multi-material objects and define new modeling operations for
    their manipulation. We also develop a computer rep- resentation for these new
    models. Finally, we present some exam- ples highlighting the implementation and
    fabrication by LM.

  abstract: In order to fabricate complex origami inspired devices, it is necessary
    to control folding pathways and enable sequential folding. We demonstrate sequential
    folding of microstructures from afar by the directed heating of pre-stressed hinges
    using low power, 40–80 mW handheld, commercial lasers. We observed that the hinge-actuation
    and consequently folding time varied with laser irradiance, wavelength, and distance.
    We highlight possible applications by sequential folding of patterned and nested
    microstructures.

  container-title: ASEE Conference Proceedings
  page: 2262-2269
  abstract: The Learning Factory integrates a practice-based curriculum and advanced
    manufacturing facilities. Its goal is to provide a new engineering educational
    experience that emphasizes the interdependency of design and manufacturing in
    a business environment. The Learning Factory offers a new approach to engineering
    education by providing balance between engineering science and practice. The key
    element in this approach is the combination of curriculum revitalization with
    coordinated opportunities for application and hands-on experience, thereby erasing
    the traditional boundaries between lecture and laboratory, academia and industrial
    practice. The Learning Factory is the product of the Manufacturing Engineering
    Education Partnership (MEEP). This partnership is a unique collaboration of three
    major universities with strong engineering programs (Penn State, University of
    Puerto Rico-Mayagüez, University of Washington), a premier high- technology government
    laboratory (Sandia National Laboratories), corporate partners covering a wide
    spectrum of U.S. Industries, and the federal government that is funding this project
    through the Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP). This paper describes our program
    and presents results from the first year of the partnership’s existence.

  abstract: 'Current interactive user interface construction tools are often more
    of a hindrance than a benefit during the early stages of user interface design.
    These tools take too much time to use and force designers to specify more of the
    design details than they wish at this early stage. Most interface designers, especially
    those who have a background in graphic design, prefer to sketch early interface
    ideas on paper or on a whiteboard. We are developing an interactive tool called
    SILK that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic
    pad and stylus. SILK preserves the important properties of pencil and paper: a
    rough drawing can be produced very quickly and the medium is very flexible. However,
    unlike a paper sketch, this electronic sketch is interactive and can easily be
    modified. In addition, our system allows designers to examine, annotate, and edit
    a complete history of the design. When the designer is satisfied with this early
    prototype, SILK can transform the sket...'

    Octopuses are molluscs that belong to the group Cephalopoda. They lack joints
    and rigid links, and as a result, their arms possess virtually limitless freedom
    of movement. These flexible appendages exhibit peculiar biomechanical features
    such as stiffness control, compliance, and high flexibility and dexterity. Studying
    the capabilities of the octopus arm is a complex task that presents a challenge
    for both biologists and roboticists, the latter of whom draw inspiration from
    the octopus in designing novel technologies within soft robotics. With this idea
    in mind, in this study, we used new, purposively developed methods of analysing
    the octopus arm in vivo to create new biologically inspired design concepts. Our
    measurements showed that the octopus arm can elongate by 70'

  abstract: This paper presents a sensory-motor coordination scheme for a robot hand-arm-head
    system that provides the robot with the capability to reach an object while pre-shaping
    the fingers to the required grasp configuration and while predicting the tactile
    image that will be perceived after grasping. A model for sensory-motor coordination
    derived from studies in humans inspired the development of this scheme. A peculiar
    feature of this model is the prediction of the tactile image. The implementation
    of the proposed scheme is based on a neuro-fuzzy module that, after a learning
    phase, starting from visual data, calculates the position and orientation of the
    hand for reaching, selects the best-suited hand configuration, and predicts the
    tactile feedback. The implementation of the scheme on a humanoid robot allowed
    experimental validation of its effectiveness in robotics and provided perspectives
    on applications of sensory predictions in robot motor control.

  abstract: 'As a result of years of research on the comparative biomechanics and
    physiology of moving through water, biologists and engineers have made considerable
    progress in understanding how animals moving underwater use their muscles to power
    movement, in describing body and appendage motion during propulsion, and in conducting
    experimental and computational analyses of fluid movement and attendant forces.
    But it is clear that substantial future progress in understanding aquatic propulsion
    will require new lines of attack. Recent years have seen the advent of one such
    new avenue that promises to greatly broaden the scope of intellectual opportunity
    available to researchers: the use of biorobotic models. In this paper we discuss,
    using aquatic propulsion in fishes as our focal example, how using robotic models
    can lead to new insights in the study of aquatic propulsion. We use two examples:
    (1) pectoral fin function, and (2) hydrodynamic interactions between dorsal and
    caudal fins. Pectoral fin function is characterized by considerable deformation
    of individual fin rays, as well as spanwise (along the length) and chordwise (across
    the fin) deformation and area change. The pectoral fin can generate thrust on
    both the outstroke and instroke. A robotic model of the pectoral fin replicates
    this result, and demonstrates the effect of altering stroke kinematics on the
    pattern of force production. The soft dorsal fin of fishes sheds a distinct vortex
    wake that dramatically alters incoming flow to the tail: the dorsal fin and caudal
    fin act as dual flapping foils in series. This design can be replicated with a
    dual-foil flapping robotic device that demonstrates this phenomenon and allows
    examination of regions of the flapping performance space not available to fishes.
    We show how the robotic flapping foil device can also be used to better understand
    the significance of flexible propulsive surfaces for locomotor performance. Finally
    we emphasize the utility of self-propelled robotic devices as a means of understanding
    how locomotor forces are generated, and review different conceptual designs for
    robotic models of aquatic propulsion.'

  abstract: 'A full understanding of the mechanics of locomotion can be achieved by
    incorporating descriptions of (1) three-dimensional kinematics of propulsor movement,
    (2) material properties of the propulsor, (3) power input and control and (4)
    the fluid dynamics effects of propulsor motion into (5) a three-dimensional computational
    framework that models the complexity of propulsors that deform and change area.
    In addition, robotic models would allow for further experimental investigation
    of changes to propulsor design and for testing of hypothesized relationships between
    movement and force production. Such a comprehensive suite of data is not yet available
    for any flexible propulsor. In this paper, we summarize our research program with
    the goal of producing a comprehensive data set for each of the five components
    noted above through a study of pectoral fin locomotion in one species of fish:
    the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus. Many fish use pectoral fins exclusively
    for locomotion, and pectoral fins in most fish are integral to generating force
    during maneuvering. Pectoral fins are complex structures composed of jointed bony
    supports that are under active control via pectoral fin musculature. During propulsion
    in sunfish, the fin deforms considerably, has two leading edges, and sunfish can
    rotate the whole fin or just control individual sections to vector thrust. Fin
    material properties vary along the length of fin rays and among rays. Experimental
    fluid dynamic analysis of sunfish pectoral fin locomotion reveals that the fin
    generates thrust throughout the fin beat cycle, and that the upper and lower edges
    each produce distinct simultaneous leading edge vortices. The following companion
    paper provides data on the computational approach taken to understand locomotion
    using flexible pectoral fins.'

  abstract: The fins of fishes are remarkable propulsive devices that appear at the
    origin of fishes about 500 million years ago and have been a key feature of fish
    evolutionary diversification. Most fish species possess both median (midline)
    dorsal, anal, and caudal fins as well as paired pectoral and pelvic fins. Fish
    fins are supported by jointed skeletal elements, fin rays, that in turn support
    a thin collagenous membrane. Muscles at the base of the fin attach to and actuate
    each fin ray, and fish fins thus generate their own hydrodynamic wake during locomotion,
    in addition to fluid motion induced by undulation of the body. In bony fishes,
    the jointed fin rays can be actively deformed and the fin surface can thus actively
    resist hydrodynamic loading. Fish fins are highly flexible, exhibit considerable
    deformation during locomotion, and can interact hydrodynamically during both propulsion
    and maneuvering. For example, the dorsal and anal fins shed a vortex wake that
    greatly modifies the flow environment experienced by the tail fin. New experimental
    kinematic and hydrodynamic data are presented for pectoral fin function in bluegill
    sunfish. The highly flexible sunfish pectoral fin moves in a complex manner with
    two leading edges, a spanwise wave of bending, and substantial changes in area
    through the fin beat cycle. Data from scanning particle image velocimetry (PIV)
    and time-resolved stereo PIV show that the pectoral fin generates thrust throughout
    the fin beat cycle, and that there is no time of net drag. Continuous thrust production
    is due to fin flexibility which enables some part of the fin to generate thrust
    at all times and to smooth out oscillations that might arise at the transition
    from outstroke to instroke during the movement cycle. Computational fluid dynamic
    analyses of sunfish pectoral fin function corroborate this conclusion. Future
    research on fish fin function will benefit considerably from close integration
    with studies of robotic model fins. 2007 Springer-Verlag.

  abstract: 'SYNOPSIS. Paired fin propulsion in fishes has classically been divided
    into two categories which represent biomechanical extremes in the use of appendages
    for propulsion: lift-based and drag-based mechanisms of thrust production. Theoretical
    models predict that fishes using drag-based propulsion should have wedge-shaped
    fins with relatively blunt distal edges, a fin beat cycle that is oriented along
    the anteroposterior (x) axis, feathering of the fin to reduce drag during the
    protraction phase, and maximal fin area during the retraction phase as the fin
    sweeps posteriorly perpendicular to the body. In this paper we use a three-dimensional
    analysis of pectoral fin propulsion in the largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides,
    to (1) evaluate the extent to which bass pectoral fin kinematics fit predictions
    of drag-based propulsion, and (2) demonstrate the complexity of fin movement when
    the traditional two-dimensional analysis is extended into three dimensions. We
    attached small markers to visualize the diaphanous distal fin edge, and we videotaped
    lateral and ventral views from which we could measure x, y, and z coordinates
    from the fin and body. We divided the fin into two triangular elements for which
    we calculated planar (three-dimensional) angles relative to each of three reference
    planes (XY, YZ, and XZ) during the fin beat cycle. We show how angles of attack
    based only on two-dimensional data may result in gross errors that severely compromise
    understanding of the mechanics and hydrodynamics of pectoral propulsion. Furthermore,
    three-dimensional analysis revealed that bass fin kinematics are much more complex
    than expected on a rowing model of drag-based propulsion, and that the pectoral
    fins may produce drag-based thrust even during protraction. Three-dimensional
    kinematic data are critical to understanding the hydrodynamics of aquatic animal
    propulsion. Such data are a necessary foundation for reconstructing patterns of
    movement, modeling (both theoretical and empirical), and for assessing the extent
    to which motion is under active control or a passive consequence of fluid resistance.'

    that summarize recent work on fish biomechanics. The findings and principles that
    have emerged from biomechanical studies of fish locomotion provide important insights

  abstract: Origami is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. Due to its fascinating
    properties, several attempts are being actively made to expand applications of
    origami-inspired designs in engineering. This paper presents the design of a deformable
    wheel based on an origami structure that was integrated with a small-scale mobile
    robot. The wheel of the robot employs an origami structure proposed by Guest et
    al. All segments of the structure are connected by links-i.e., folding lines-and
    this linked structure provides advantages in terms of maintaining geometry and
    force transmissibility. These two advantages enable control of the shape or size
    of the wheel by activating a certain portion of the structure. With this property,
    the wheel diameter of the robot is reduced from 11 cm to 4 cm by four SMA coil
    spring actuators. Two plate springs are embedded in the wheel to maintain stiffness
    and allow the wheel to recover from contraction. With the deformable wheel, the
    robot can pass through a 5 cm gap despite having an 11 cm wheel in its normal
    state. This deformable wheel concept can be used to build mobile robots that can
    move quickly with large wheels and move through small gaps when required.

  abstract: 'Quantitative characterization of ankle mechanical impedance is important
    to understand how the ankle supports lower-extremity functions during interaction
    with the environment. This paper reports a novel procedure to characterize static
    multivariable ankle mechanical impedance. An experimental protocol using a wearable
    therapeutic robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable measurement of torque and angle
    data in multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously, a combination of inversion-eversion
    and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion. The measured multivariable torque-angle relation
    was represented as a vector field, and approximated using a method based on thin-plate
    spline smoothing with generalized cross validation. The vector field enabled assessment
    of several important characteristics of static ankle mechanical impedance, which
    are not available from prior single degree of freedom studies: the directional
    variation of ankle mechanical impedance, the extent to which the ankle behaves
    as a spring, and evidence of uniquely neural contributions. The method was validated
    by testing a simple physical "mock-up" consisting of passive elements. Experiments
    with young unimpaired subjects quantified the behavior of the maximally relaxed
    human ankle, showing that ankle mechanical impedance is spring-like but strongly
    direction-dependent, being weakest in inversion. Remarkably, the analysis was
    sufficiently sensitive to detect a subtle but statistically significant deviation
    from spring-like behavior if subjects were not fully relaxed. This method may
    provide new insight about the function of the ankle, both unimpaired and after
    biomechanical or neurological injury. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.'

  abstract: 2016 IEEE. Understanding the passive or nonpassive behavior of the neuromuscular
    system is important to design and control robots that physically interact with
    humans, since it provides quantitative information to secure coupled stability
    while maximizing performance. This has become more important than ever apace with
    the increasing demand for robotic technologies in neurorehabilitation. This paper
    presents a quantitative characterization of passive and nonpassive behavior of
    the ankle of young healthy subjects, which provides a baseline for future studies
    in persons with neurological impairments and information for future developments
    of rehabilitation robots, such as exoskeletal devices and powered prostheses.
    Measurements using a wearable ankle robot actuating 2 degrees-of-freedom of the
    ankle combined with curl analysis and passivity analysis enabled characterization
    of both quasi-static and steady-state dynamic behavior of the ankle, unavailable
    from single DOF studies. Despite active neuromuscular control over a wide range
    of muscle activation, in young healthy subjects passive or dissipative ankle behavior
    predominated.

  title: Time-Varying Ankle Mechanical Impedance During Human Locomotion
  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering
  page: 755-764
  volume: '23'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: 2014 IEEE. In human locomotion, we continuously modulate joint mechanical
    impedance of the lower limb (hip, knee, and ankle) either voluntarily or reflexively
    to accommodate environmental changes and maintain stable interaction. Ankle mechanical
    impedance plays a pivotal role at the interface between the neuro-mechanical system
    and the physical world. This paper reports, for the first time, a characterization
    of human ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom simultaneously as
    it varies with time during walking. Ensemble-based linear time-varying system
    identification methods implemented with a wearable ankle robot, Anklebot, enabled
    reliable estimation of ankle mechanical impedance from the pre-swing phase through
    the entire swing phase to the early-stance phase. This included heel-strike and
    toe-off, key events in the transition from the swing to stance phase or vice versa.
    Time-varying ankle mechanical impedance was accurately approximated by a second
    order model consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both inversion-eversion
    and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion directions, as observed in our previous steady-state
    dynamic studies. We found that viscosity and stiffness of the ankle significantly
    decreased at the end of the stance phase before toe-off, remained relatively constant
    across the swing phase, and increased around heel-strike. Closer investigation
    around heel-strike revealed that viscosity and stiffness in both planes increased
    before heel-strike occurred. This finding is important evidence of "pretuning"
    by the central nervous system. In addition, viscosity and stiffness were greater
    in the sagittal plane than in the frontal plane across all subgait phases, except
    the early stance phase. Comparison with previous studies and implications for
    clinical study of neurologically impaired patients are provided.

  abstract: 2013 IEEE. The human ankle joint plays a critical role during walking
    and understanding the biomechanical factors that govern ankle behavior and provides
    fundamental insight into normal and pathologically altered gait. Previous researchers
    have comprehensively studied ankle joint kinetics and kinematics during many biomechanical
    tasks, including locomotion; however, only recently have researchers been able
    to quantify how the mechanical impedance of the ankle varies during walking. The
    mechanical impedance describes the dynamic relationship between the joint position
    and the joint torque during perturbation, and is often represented in terms of
    stiffness, damping, and inertia. The purpose of this short communication is to
    unify the results of the first two studies measuring ankle mechanical impedance
    in the sagittal plane during walking, where each study investigated differing
    regions of the gait cycle. Rouse et al. measured ankle impedance from late loading
    response to terminal stance, where Lee et al. quantified ankle impedance from
    pre-swing to early loading response. While stiffness component of impedance increases
    significantly as the stance phase of walking progressed, the change in damping
    during the gait cycle is much less than the changes observed in stiffness. In
    addition, both stiffness and damping remained low during the swing phase of walking.
    Future work will focus on quantifying impedance during the ’push off’ region of
    stance phase, as well as measurement of these properties in the coronal plane.

  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 4547-4553
  volume: 2015-June
  issue: June
  abstract: Collapsible leg spines found on insects and spiders provide a passive
    mechanism for increased traction while running over complex terrain. In this paper
    we use this architectural advantage as biological inspiration to increase the
    useful work in pulling a load with a VelociRoACH, a high speed terrestrial robot.
    These spines exhibit anisotropic properties in the fore-aft and lateral directions,
    with a 2:1 holding-to-release force ratio on corkboard (0.2 N to 0.1 N). This
    increase in effective friction coefficient at the foot-to-surface contact points
    has decreased the Cost of Pulling for the VelociRoACH by ten times, allowing it
    to transport loads using less energy. The VelociRoACH with spines is able to engage
    the surface and pull up to 0.36 N whereas without spines it slips while pulling
    0.2 N, demonstrating that the robot’s performance with spines is now torque limited
    rather than friction limited. The spines also allow the robot to remain dynamically
    stable and resist torque disturbances.

  abstract: Superabsorbent hydrogels are significant not only in materials science
    but also in industries and daily life, being used in diapers or soil conditioners
    as typical examples. The main feature of these materials is their capacity to
    hold considerable amount of water, which is strongly dependent on the cross-linking
    density. This study focuses on the preparation of hydrogels by reweighing the
    effect of cross-linking density on physical properties, which provides green fabrication
    of bilayered hydrogels that consist of homogeneous structural motifs but show
    programmed responses via sequential radical polymerization. In particular, when
    two hydrogel layers containing different cross-linking densities are joined together,
    an integrated linear bilayer shows heterogeneous deformation triggered by water.
    We monitor the linear hydrogel bilayer bending into a circle and engineer it by
    incorporating disperse dyes, changing colors as well as physical properties. In
    addition, we demonstrate an electric circuit switch u...

  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 3625-3631
  volume: 2016-June
  abstract: — Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is gaining traction for rapid prototyping
    and custom fabrication. Existing toolpath generation methods for FFF printers
    take as input a three-dimensional model of the target object and construct a layered
    toolpath that will fabricate the object in 2D slices of a chosen thickness. While
    this approach is computationally straightforward, it can produce toolpaths that
    can contain significant, yet unnecessary, extrusionless travel. In this paper
    we propose a novel 3D toolpath generation paradigm that leverages local feature
    independence in the target object. In contrast to existing FFF slicing methods
    which print an object layer by layer, our algorithm provides a means to print
    local features of an object without being constrained to a single layer. The key
    benefit of our approach is a tremendous reduction in " extrusionless travel, "
    in which the printer must move between features without performing any extrusion.
    We show on a benchmark of 409 objects that our method can yield substantial savings
    in extrusionless travel, 34

    wings</span>
  container-title: Nature
  page: 1082-1085
  volume: '446'
  issue: '7139'
  abstract: Gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings, presumably
    to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance.
    That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively
    by analytical glide models, which extrapolated the wing’s performance envelope
    from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance
    of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a
    semi-empirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts’ behavioural
    envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or
    triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept
    wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better
    aerodynamic performance-with the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less
    effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme
    loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at
    speeds of 8-10 m s(-1), whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15-25
    m s(-1). In fact, swifts spend the night (’roost’) in flight at 8-10 m s(-1) (ref.
    11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour. Morphing
    not only adjusts birds’ wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control
    the flight of future aircraft.

  volume: 6472 LNAI
  abstract: Simulation is essential for different robotic research fields such as
    mobile robotics, motion planning and grasp planning. For grasping in particular,
    there are no software simulation packages, which provide a holistic environment
    that can deal with the variety of aspects associated with this problem. These
    aspects include development and testing of new algorithms, modeling of the environments
    and robots, including the modeling of actuators, sensors and contacts. In this
    paper, we present a new simulation toolkit for grasping and dexterous manipulation
    called OpenGRASP addressing those aspects in addition to extensibility, interoperability
    and public availability. OpenGRASP is based on a modular architecture, that supports
    the creation and addition of new functionality and the integration of existing
    and widely-used technologies and standards. In addition, a designated editor has
    been created for the generation and migration of such models. We demonstrate the
    current state of OpenGRASPs development and its application in a grasp evaluation
    environment.

  abstract: Chemists at Abbott Laboratories are totally dependent on a rapid return
    of spectroscopic data on their intermediates and synthetic products to ensure
    that their chemical reactions are on track. Eight years ago, chemists at Abbott
    often had to wait three days to a week to receive this data, and had to start
    new reactions without it. That this was an unacceptable situation was clearly
    recognized by the Abbott chemists, and the management of the spectroscopy area.
    This paper discusses the approach used to provide totally automated sample preparation
    and running of both NMR and mass spectrometric samples. In both cases, systems
    have been developed by which the chemists log their own samples into a database,
    and a Zymark robotics system does the entire sample preparation and insertion
    into the spectrometer. Spectra are plotted directly in the client’s lab, and the
    spectroscopy staff need only provide samples to the robot, fresh supplies (solvents,
    tubes, etc.) and routine maintenance, but no actual sample handling or spectrometer
    operation. The effects of this automation on throughput, sample turnaround time,
    and cost per spectrum are presented.

  abstract: A funtional morphological study has been made of the joints of the primate
    hand, particular emphasis being placed upon the carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal
    joints. The presumptive evolutionary history of these joints has been charted
    by reference to a comparative series of mammals. It has been demonstrated that
    the human joints have been quite strikingly modified in a number of ways, and
    that these evolutionary changes may be logically correlated with the refined functional
    attributes of the human hand. The morphological background thus established has
    been applied in a preliminary study of the hand bones of various fossil hominids.

  abstract: Animals and robots alike face challenges of flipping-over as they move
    in complex terrain. Small insects like cockroaches can rapidly right themselves
    when upside down, yet small fast-running legged robots are much less capable of
    ground-based self-righting. Inspired by the discoid cockroach that opens its wings
    to push against the ground to self-right, we designed actuated wings for robot
    self-righting based on recently-developed rounded shells for obstacle traversal
    \[1\]. We measured the self-righting performance of a robot using these actuated
    wings, and systematically studied the effects and trade-offs of wing opening magnitude,
    speed, symmetry, and wing geometry. Our study provided a proof-of-concept that
    robots can take advantage of an existing body structure (rounded shell) in novel
    ways (as actuated wings) to serve new locomotor functions, analogous to biological
    exaptations \[2\]. Our results demonstrated that the robot self-rights dynamically,
    with active wing pushing followed by passive falling, and benefits from increasing
    kinetic energy by pushing faster and longer. Our experiments also showed that
    opening both wings asymmetrically increases righting probability at low wing opening
    magnitudes.

  abstract: This paper presents a bio-inspired design of a jumping mini robot including
    the theoretical analysis on jumping dynamics based on a simplified biological
    model, the dynamically optimized saltatorial leg design, the overall design of
    the jumping robot prototype and, as a part of the bio-mimetic research, and the
    measuring and comparing of the jumping characteristics between the robot and animal.
    The artificial saltatorial leg is designed to imitate the characteristics of a
    real jumping insect, kinematically and dynamically, and proposed to reduce the
    contact force at tarsus-ground interface during jumping acceleration thus optimizes
    the jumping motion by minimizing the risk of both leg ruptures and tarsus slippage.
    Then by means of high speed camera experiment, the jumping characteristics of
    the theoretical jumping model, the jumping insect leafhopper and the robot are
    compared so as to show the dynamic similarity and optimization results among them.
    The final energy integrated jumping robot prototype is able to accomplish a movement
    of continuous jumping, of which a single jumping reaches 100 mm high and 200 mm
    long, about twice and four times of its body length respectively. 2012 Elsevier

  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: '201713450'
  volume: '114'
  issue: '50'
  abstract: Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for myriad
    common machines and robots. However, the design, fabrication, and implementation
    of artificial muscles are often limited by their material costs, operating principle,
    scalability, and single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here
    we propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles.
    This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a flexible skin, and a fluid
    medium. A mechanical model is developed to explain the interaction of the three
    components. A fabrication method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost
    artificial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The artificial
    muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions including contraction,
    bending, and torsion. These motions can be aggregated into systems with multiple
    degrees of freedom, which are able to produce controllable motions at different
    rates. Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative
    to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial
    muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles
    can contract over 90

  container-title: IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics

  volume: '13'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Human grasps, especially whole-hand grasps, are difficult to animate because
    of the high number of degrees of freedom of the hand and the need for the hand
    to conform naturally to the object surface. Captured human motion data provides
    us with a rich source of examples of natural grasps. However, for each new object,
    we are faced with the problem of selecting the best grasp from the database and
    adapting it to that object. This paper presents a data-driven approach to grasp
    synthesis. We begin with a database of captured human grasps. To identify candidate
    grasps for a new object, we introduce a novel shape matching algorithm that matches
    hand shape to object shape by identifying collections of features having similar
    relative placements and surface normals. This step returns many grasp candidates,
    which are clustered and pruned by choosing the grasp best suited for the intended
    task. For pruning undesirable grasps, we develop an anatomically-based grasp quality
    measure specific to the human hand. Examples of grasp synthesis are shown for
    a variety of objects not present in the original database. This algorithm should
    be useful both as an animator tool for posing the hand and for automatic grasp
    synthesis in virtual environments.

  abstract: The problem of optimal grasping of an object by a multifingered robot
    hand is discussed. Using screw theory and elementary differential geometry, the
    concept of a grasp is axiomated and its stability characterized. Three quality
    measures for evaluating a grasp are then proposed. The last quality measure is
    task oriented and needs the development of a procedure for modeling tasks as ellipsoids
    in the wrench space of the object. Numerical computations of these quality measures
    and the selection of an optimal grasp are addressed in detail. Several examples
    are given using these quality measures to show that they are consistent with measurements
    yielded by our experiments on grasping. 1988 IEEE

  abstract: This article considers the turning characteristics of robotic fish with

    are first established for three cases propelled by both sides of pectoral fins,
    flexible body/caudal fin, and composite of them. Then, the turning characteristics
    of such three cases are analyzed by numerical simulations and experiments. The
    results show that if robotic fish is cooperatively propelled by pectoral fins
    and flexible body, it can obtain the fast turning speed and the average turning
    speed is up to 0.6 rad s À1 . The smallest turning speed is achieved as robotic
    fish is only propelled by pectoral fins; however, it can turn on the spot in this
    case. The presented results provide the more abundant ways of turning, the better
    maneuverability, and the higher turning speed for the proposed robotic fish.

    Learning</span>
  abstract: Most Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) algorithms require a prohibitively
    large number of training samples for learning complex tasks. Many recent works
    on speeding up Deep RL have focused on distributed training and simulation. While
    distributed training is often done on the GPU, simulation is not. In this work,
    we propose using GPU-accelerated RL simulations as an alternative to CPU ones.
    Using NVIDIA Flex, a GPU-based physics engine, we show promising speed-ups of
    learning various continuous-control, locomotion tasks. With one GPU and CPU core,
    we are able to train the Humanoid running task in less than 20 minutes, using
    10-1000x fewer CPU cores than previous works. We also demonstrate the scalability
    of our simulator to multi-GPU settings to train more challenging locomotion tasks.

    the potential benefits of Web3D and AR technologies in engineering education and
    learning. A lecturer’s traditional delivery can be enriched by viewing multimedia
    content locally or over the Internet, as well as in a table-top AR environment.
    The implemented framework is composed an XML data repository, an XML based communications
    server, and an XML based client visualisation application. In this paper we illustrate
    the architecture by configuring it to deliver multimedia content related to the
    teaching of mechanical engineering. We illustrate four mechanical engineering
    themes (machines, vehicles, platonic solids and tools) to demonstrate use of the
    system to support learning through Web3D. INTRODUCTION

  abstract: In 1969, a palaeontologist proposed that theropod dinosaurs used their
    tails as dynamic stabilizers during rapid or irregular movements, contributing
    to their depiction as active and agile predators. Since then the inertia of swinging
    appendages has been implicated in stabilizing human walking, aiding acrobatic
    manoeuvres by primates and rodents, and enabling cats to balance on branches.
    Recent studies on geckos suggest that active tail stabilization occurs during
    climbing, righting and gliding. By contrast, studies on the effect of lizard tail
    loss show evidence of a decrease, an increase or no change in performance. Application
    of a control-theoretic framework could advance our general understanding of inertial
    appendage use in locomotion. Here we report that lizards control the swing of
    their tails in a measured manner to redirect angular momentum from their bodies
    to their tails, stabilizing body attitude in the sagittal plane. We video-recorded
    Red-Headed Agama lizards (Agama agama) leaping towards a vertical surface by first
    vaulting onto an obstacle with variable traction to induce a range of perturbations
    in body angular momentum. To examine a known controlled tail response, we built
    a lizard-sized robot with an active tail that used sensory feedback to stabilize
    pitch as it drove off a ramp. Our dynamics model revealed that a body swinging
    its tail experienced less rotation than a body with a rigid tail, a passively
    compliant tail or no tail. To compare a range of tails, we calculated tail effectiveness
    as the amount of tailless body rotation a tail could stabilize. A model Velociraptor
    mongoliensis supported the initial tail stabilization hypothesis, showing as it
    did a greater tail effectiveness than the Agama lizards. Leaping lizards show
    that inertial control of body attitude can advance our understanding of appendage
    evolution and provide biological inspiration for the next generation of manoeuvrable
    search-and-rescue robots.

    flapping foils that use power downstroke</span>
  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 63-71
  volume: '213'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: We show experimentally that flapping foil kinematics consisting of a power
    downstroke and a feathering upstroke together with a properly timed in-line motion,
    similar to those employed in forelimb propulsion of sea turtles, can produce high
    thrust and be hydrodynamically as efficient as symmetrically flapping foils. The
    crucial parameter for such asymmetrically flapping foils is a properly sized and
    timed in-line motion, whose effect is quantified by a new parameter, the advance
    angle, defined as the angle of the foil trajectory with respect to the horizontal,
    evaluated at the middle of the power downstroke. We show, in particular, that
    optimal efficiency in high aspect ratio rigid foils, accompanied by significant
    thrust production, is obtained for Strouhal numbers in the range 0.2-0.6 for Reynolds
    number equal to 13,000, and for values of the advance angle around 0.55pi (100
    deg.). The optimized kinematics consist of the foil moving back axially during
    the downstroke, in the direction of the oncoming flow, and rotating with a large
    pitch angle. This causes the force vector to rotate and become nearly parallel
    to the steady flow, thus providing a large thrust and a smaller transverse force.
    During the upstroke, the foil is feathering while it moves axially forward, i.e.
    away from the vorticity shed during the power stroke; as a result, the transverse
    force remains relatively small and no large drag force is produced. Observations
    from turtles confirm qualitatively the findings from the foil experiments.

  title: <span class="nocase">Aquatic animal propulsion of high hydromechanical efficiency</span>
  container-title: Journal of Fluid Mechanics
  page: '265'
  volume: '44'
  issue: '02'
  abstract: This paper attempts to emulate the great study by Goldstein (1929) ‘On
    the vortex wake of a screw propeller’, by looking for a dynamical theory of how
    another type of propulsion system has evolved towards ever higher performance.
    An ‘undulatory’ mode of animal propulsion in water is rather common among invertebrates,
    and this paper offers a preliminary quantitative analysis of how a series of modifications
    of that basic undulatory mode, found in the vertebrates (and especially in the
    fishes), tends to improve speed and hydromechanical efficiency. Posterior lateral
    compression is the most important of these. It is studied first in ‘pure anguilliform’
    (eel-like) motion of fishes whose posterior cross-sections are laterally compressed,
    although maintaining their depth (while the body tapers) by means of long continuous
    dorsal and ventral fins all the way to a vertical ‘trailing edge’. Lateral motion
    of such a cross-section produces a large and immediate exchange of momentum with
    a considerable ‘virtual mass’ of water near it. In §2, ‘elongated-body theory’
    (an extended version of inviscid slender-body theory) is developed in detail for
    pure anguilliform motion and subjected to several careful checks and critical
    studies. Provided that longitudinal variation of cross-sectional properties is
    slow on a scale of the cross-sectional depth s (say, if the wavelength of significant
    harmonic components of that variation exceeds 5s), the basic approach is applicable
    and lateral water momentum per unit length is closely proportional to the square
    of the local cross-section depth. The vertical trailing edge can be thought of
    as acting with a lateral force on the wake through lateral water momentum shed
    as the fish moves on. The fish’s mean rate of working is the mean product of this
    lateral force with the lateral component of trailing-edge movement, and is enhanced
    by the virtual-mass effect, which makes for good correlation between lateral movement
    and local water momentum. The mean rate of shedding of energy of lateral water
    motions into the vortex wake represents the wasted element in this mean rate of
    working, and it is from the difference of these two rates that thrust and efficiency
    can best be calculated. Section 3, still from the standpoint of inviscid theory,
    studies the effect of any development of discrete dorsal and ventral fins, through
    calculations on vortex sheets shed by fins. A multiplicity of discrete dorsal
    (or ventral) fins might be thought to destroy the slow variation of cross-sectional
    properties on which elongated-body theory depends, but the vortex sheets filling
    the gaps between them are shown to maintain continuity rather effectively, avoiding
    thrust reduction and permitting a slight decrease in drag. Further advantage may
    accrue from a modification of such a system in which (while essentially anguilliform
    movement is retained) the anterior dorsal and ventral fins become the only prominent
    ones. Vortex sheets in the gaps between them and the caudal fin may largely be
    reabsorbed into the caudal-fin boundary layer, without any significant increase
    in wasted wake energy. The mean rate of working can be improved, however, because
    the trailing edges of the dorsal and ventral fins do work that is not cancelled
    at the caudal fin’s leading edge, as phase shifts destroy the correlation of that
    edge’s lateral movement with the vortex-sheet momentum reabsorbed there. Tentative
    improvements to elongated-body theory through taking into account lateral forces
    of viscous origin are made in §4. These add to both the momentumandenergyof the
    water’s lateral motions, but mayreduce the efficiencyof anguilliform motion because
    the extra momentum at the trailing edge, resulting from forces exerted by anterior
    sections, is badly correlated with that edge’s lateral movements. Adoption of
    the ‘carangiform’ mode, in which the amplitude of the basic undulation grows steeply
    from almost zero over the first half or even two-thirds of a fish’s length to
    a large value at the caudal fin, avoids this difficulty. Any movement which a
    fish attempts to make, however, is liable to be accompanied by ‘recoil’, that
    is, by extra movements of pure translation and rotation required for overall conservation
    of momentum and angular momentum. These recoil movements, a potentially serious
    source of thrust and efficiency loss in carangiform motion, are calculated in
    §4, which shows how they are minimized with the right distribution of total inertia
    (the sum of fish mass and the water’s virtual mass). It seems to be no coincidence
    that carangiform motion goes always with a long anterior region of high depth
    (possessing a substantial moment of total inertia) and a region of greatly reduced
    depth just before the caudal fin. The theory suggests (§5) that reduction of caudal-fin
    area in relation to depth by development of a caudal fin into a herring-like ‘pair
    of highly sweptback wings’ should reduce drag without significant loss of thrust.
    The same effect can be expected (although elongated-body theory ceases to be applicable)
    from widening of the wing pair (sweepback reduction). That line of development
    of the carangiform mode in many of the Percomorphi leads towards the lunate tail,
    a culminating point in the enhancement of speed and propulsive efficiency which
    has been reached also along some quite different lines of evolution. A beginning
    in the analysis of its advantages is made here using a ‘twodimensional’ linearized
    theory. Movements of any horizontal section of caudal fin, with yaw angle fluctuating
    in phase with its velocity of lateral translation, are studied for different positions
    of the yawing axis. The wasted energy in the wake has a sharp minimum when that
    axis is at the ‘three-quarter-chord point’, but rate of working increases somewhat
    for axis positions distal to that. Something like an optimum regarding efficiency,
    thrust and the proportion of thrust derived from suction at the section’s rounded
    leading edge is found when the yawing axis is along the trailing edge. This leads
    on the present over-simplified theory to the suggestion that a hydromechanically
    advantageous configuration has the leading edge bowed forward but the trailing
    edge straight. Finally, there is a brief discussion of possible future work, taking
    three-dimensional and non-linear effects into account, that might throw light
    on the commonness of a trailing edge that is itself slightly bowed forward among
    the fastest marine animals. (Published Online March 29 2006) (Received January

  abstract: DNA tile based self-assembly provides an attractive route to create nanoarchitectures
    of programmable patterns. It also offers excellent scaffolds for directed self-assembly
    of nanometer-scale materials, ranging from nanoparticles to proteins, with potential
    applications in constructing nanoelectronic/nanophotonic devices and protein/ligand
    nanoarrays. This Review first summarizes the currently available DNA tile toolboxes
    and further emphasizes recent developments toward self-assembling DNA nanostructures
    with increasing complexity. Exciting progress using DNA tiles for directed self-assembly
    of other nanometer scale components is also discussed.

  page: '20140239'
  volume: '11'
  issue: '96'
  abstract: Various flight navigation strategies for birds have been identified at
    the large spatial scales of migratory and homing behaviours. However, relatively
    little is known about close-range obstacle negotiation through cluttered environments.
    To examine obstacle flight guidance, we tracked pigeons (Columba livia) flying
    through an artificial forest of vertical poles. Interestingly, pigeons adjusted
    their flight path only approximately 1.5 m from the forest entry, suggesting a
    reactive mode of path planning. Combining flight trajectories with obstacle pole
    positions, we reconstructed the visual experience of the pigeons throughout obstacle
    flights. Assuming proportional-derivative control with a constant delay, we searched
    the relevant parameter space of steering gains and visuomotor delays that best
    explained the observed steering. We found that a pigeon’s steering resembles proportional
    control driven by the error angle between the flight direction and the desired
    opening, or gap, between obstacles. Using this pigeon steering controller, we
    simulated obstacle flights and showed that pigeons do not simply steer to the
    nearest opening in the direction of flight or destination. Pigeons bias their
    flight direction towards larger visual gaps when making fast steering decisions.
    The proposed behavioural modelling method converts the obstacle avoidance behaviour
    into a (piecewise) target-aiming behaviour, which is better defined and understood.
    This study demonstrates how such an approach decomposes open-loop free-flight
    behaviours into components that can be independently evaluated.

  abstract: An image-based method for vehicle speed detection is presented. Conventional
    speed measurement techniques use radar- or laser-based devices, which are usually
    more expensive compared to a passive camera system. In this work, a single image
    captured with vehicle motion is used for speed measurement. Due to the relative
    motion between the camera and a moving object during the camera exposure time,
    motion blur occurs in the dynamic region of the image. It provides a visual cue
    for the speed measurement of a moving object. An approximate target region is
    first segmented and blur parameters are estimated from the motion blurred subimage.
    The image is then deblurred and used to derive other parameters. Finally, the
    vehicle speed is calculated according to the imaging geometry, camera pose, and
    blur extent in the image. Experiments have shown the estimated speeds within 5

    Reconstruction Surface</span>
  container-title: International symposium of robotics research
  abstract: In this paper a new method for fast visual grasp of unknown objects is
    presented. The method is composed of an object surface reconstruction algorithm
    and of a local grasp planner, evolving in a parallel way. The reconstruction algorithm
    makes use of images taken by a camera carried by the robot, mounted in an eye-in-hand
    configuration. An elastic reconstruction sphere, composed by masses interconnected
    each other by springs, is virtually placed around the object. The sphere is let
    to evolve dynamically under the action of external forces, which push the masses
    towards the object centroid. To smoothen the surface evolution, spatial dampers
    are attached to each mass. The reconstruction surface shrinks toward its center
    of mass until some pieces of its surface intercept the object visual hull, and
    thus local rejection forces are generated to push out the reconstruction points
    until they stay into the visual hull. This process shapes the sphere around the
    unknown object. Running in parallel to the reconstruction algorithm, the grasp
    planner moves the fingertips, floating on the current available reconstructed
    surface, according to suitable quality measures. The fingers keep moving towards
    local minima depending on the evolution of the reconstruction surface deformation.
    The process stops when the object has been completely reconstructed and the planner
    reaches a local minimum. Quality measures considering both hand and grasp proprieties
    are adopted. Simulations are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed
    algorithm.

  abstract: 'This paper describes a relaxation-based method for simulating 2D and
    3D compound kinematic mechanisms. The relaxational process iteratively propagates
    node motions and degrees of freedom throughout a given kinematic mechanism. While
    relaxation methods were classically used to solve static problems, we show that
    the propagation of displacements during the calculation process itself reveals
    the kinematics of the structure. The method is slower than approaches based on
    solving simultaneous differential equations of motion, but provides several advantages:
    It achieves a higher level of accuracy, is more robust in handling transient singularities
    and degeneracies of the mechanism, and can handle more complex compound mechanisms
    with many links in multiple entangled kinematic chains. It also allows straightforward
    introduction of linkages with nonlinear behaviors such as wrapping strings, hydraulics,
    actuators, contacts, and other arbitrary responses. The basic simulation algorithm
    is presented, and a number of applications are provided including robotics, design,
    and biomechanics.'

  abstract: 'Physical models of machines have played an important role in the history
    of engineering for teaching, analyzing, and exploring me- chanical concepts. Many
    of these models have been replaced to- day by computational representations, but
    new rapid-prototyping (RP) technologies are now allowing reintroduction of physical
    models as an intuitive way to demonstrate mechanical concepts. This paper reports
    on the use of RP to document, preserve, repro- duce, and share in three dimensions,
    historic machines, and mechanisms. We have reproduced several preassembled, fully
    functional historic mechanisms from the Cornell Collection of Reuleaux Kinematic
    Models, and made these available as part of a new online museum of mechanism:
    Not only can visitors read descriptions, view pictures and videos, and interact
    with simula- tions of machines, but they can now also download and 3D-print their
    own physical functional replicas. We expect that this new form of “physical” preservation
    will become prevalent in future archives'

  abstract: Biological life is in control of its own means of reproduction, which
    generally involves complex, autocatalysing chemical reactions. But this autonomy
    of design and manufacture has not yet been realized artificially. Robots are still
    laboriously designed and constructed by teams of human engineers, usually at considerable
    expense. Few robots are available because these costs must be absorbed through
    mass production, which is justified only for toys, weapons and industrial systems
    such as automatic teller machines. Here we report the results of a combined computational
    and experimental approach in which simple electromechanical systems are evolved
    through simulations from basic building blocks (bars, actuators and artificial
    neurons); the ’fittest’ machines (defined by their locomotive ability) are then
    fabricated robotically using rapid manufacturing technology. We thus achieve autonomy
    of design and construction using evolution in a ’limited universe’ physical simulation
    coupled to automatic fabrication.

  volume: '36'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: This paper presents a parametric and feature-based methodology for the
    design of solids with local composition control (LCC). A suite of composition
    design features are conceptualized and implemented. The designer can use them
    singly or in combination, to specify the composition of complex components. Each
    material composition design feature relates directly to the geometry of the design,
    often relying on user interaction to specify critical aspects of the geometry.
    This approach allows the designer to simultaneously edit geometry and composition
    by varying parameters until a satisfactory result is attained. The identified
    LCC features are those based on volume, transition, pattern, and (user-defined)
    surface features. The material composition functions include functions parametrized
    with respect to distance or distances to user-defined geometric features; and
    functions that use Laplace’s equation to blend smoothly various boundary conditions
    including values and gradients of the material composition on the boundaries.
    The Euclidean digital distance transform and the Boundary Element Method are adapted
    to the efficient computation of composition functions. Theoretical and experimental
    complexity, accuracy and convergence analyses are presented. The representations
    underlying the composition design features are analytic in nature and therefore
    concise. Evaluation for visualization and fabrication is performed only at the
    resolutions required for these purposes, thereby reducing the computational burden.

  volume: '42'

  abstract: The paper presents hardware and software architecture of the new developed
    compact multisensory DLR-HIT hand. The hand has four identical fingers and an
    extra degree of freedom for palm. In each finger there is a Field Programmable
    Gate Array (FPGA) for data collection, brushless DC motors control and communication
    with palm’s FPGA by Point-to-Point Serial Communication (PPSeCo). The kernel of
    the hardware system is a PCI-based high speed floating-point Digital Signal Processor
    (DSP) for data processing, and FPGA for high speed (up to 25 Mbps) real-time serial
    communication with the palm’s FPGA. In order to achieve high modularity and reliability
    of the hand, a fully mechatronic integration and analog signals in situ digitalization
    philosophy are implemented to minimize the dimension, number of the cables (five
    cables including power supply) and protect data communication from outside disturbances.
    Furthermore, according to the hardware structure of the hand, a hierarchical software
    structure has been established to perform all data processing and the control
    of the hand. It provides basic API functions and skills to access all hardware
    resources for data acquisition, computation and tele-operation. With the nice
    design of the hand’s envelop, the hand looks more like humanoid.

    approach</span>'
  container-title: Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization
  page: 563-582
  volume: '52'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: This paper presents an explicit feature-based level-set topology optimization
    method involving polyline-arc profiling and 2.5D machining processes. This method
    relies on a feature fitting algorithm incorporated into the boundary evolvement
    process in order to regulate the noisy velocity fields and thus introduce new
    explicit feature primitives; once inserted, the feature-based shape optimization
    algorithm is implemented to determine the optimum part shape and topology. The
    research novelty lies in that, the best-fit feature primitives are inserted during
    the topology optimization process while other researchers so far have reported
    only manipulating some existing features with the conventional level-set methods.
    Therefore, feature-based design can be realized without special requirement of
    initial input or any post-processing. From the perspective of potential applications,
    the engineering information embedded in those feature primitives can be extracted
    and integrated into the optimization formulation. Such potential integration can
    make the topology optimization even more useful and practical. This effort is
    an extension of level-set topology optimization into a domain of structural optimization
    for manufacturing (OFM).

  abstract: 'This paper presents a novel approach to modelling carangiform fish-like
    swimming motion for multi-joint robotic fish so that they can obtain fish-like
    behaviours and mimic the body motion of carangiform fish. A given body motion
    function of fish swimming is firstly converted to a tail motion function which
    describes the tail motion relative to the head. Then, the tail motion function
    is discretized into a series of tail postures over time. Thirdly, a digital approximation
    method calculates the turning angles of joints in the tail to approximate each
    tail posture; and finally, these angles are grouped into a look-up table, or regressed
    to a time-dependent function, for practically controlling the tail motors in a
    multi-joint robotic fish. The paper made three contributions: tail motion relative
    to the head, an error function for digital approximation and regressing a look-up
    table for online optimization. To prove the feasibility of the proposed methodology,
    two basic swimming motion patterns, cruise straight and C-shape sharp turning,
    are modelled and implemented in our robotic fish. The experimental results show
    that the relative tail motion and the approximation error function are good choices
    and the proposed method is feasible. 2010 Jilin University.'

  abstract: Thermoresponsive hydrogel fibrous membranes showing directionally controlled

    time. They show reversible coiling, rolling, bending, and twisting deformations
    in different controllable directions for many cycles (at least 50 cycles tried)
    with inside-out change in surfaces and shapes. Speed, reversibility, large-scale
    deformations and, most importantly, control over the direction of deformation
    is required in order to make synthetic actuators inspired from natural materials
    or otherwise. A polymeric synthetic material combining all these properties is
    still awaited. This issue is addressed and provide a very simple system fulfilling
    all these requirements by combining porosity and asymmetric swelling/shrinking
    via orientation of hydrogel fibers at different angles in a fibrous membrane.
    Electrospinning is used as a tool for making membranes with fibers oriented at
    different angles.

  abstract: 2018 American Chemical Society. Homogeneous polyelectrolyte complex (PEC)
    hydrogels made from chitosan and carboxymethylcellulose were prepared in the LiOH/KOH/urea
    aqueous system through a freeze-thawing method. Following the treatments of sequential
    chemical and physical cross-linking, the resulting hydrogels with supertough mechanical
    strength can operate as fast response actuators under electrical stimulus in salt
    aqueous solutions. The electromechanical behaviors of the hydrogels are strongly
    dependent on experimental parameters such as electric voltage, solvent constituents,
    pH, and ionic strength. It is proposed that the electromechanical deformation
    of hydrogel originates from a dynamic osmotic equilibrium effect taking place
    at the interface between the hydrogel and the surrounding medium, which is induced
    by the migration of ions throughout the gel network. In addition, programmable
    3D shape transformations were obtained by using the PEC hydrogel with designed
    2D geometric patterns. Moreover, the bending actuation behavior of the PEC hydrogel
    can propel an adjacent object to move forward. These hydrogels are expected to
    be used as underwater actuators for soft robotics and other smart biomimetic systems.

  abstract: Living organisms are adept at resisting contact deformation and damage
    by assembling protective surfaces with spatially varied mechanical properties,
    i.e., by creating functionally graded materials. Such gradients, together with
    multiple length-scale hierarchical structures, represent the two prime characteristics
    of many biological materials to be translated into engineering design. Here, we
    examine one design motif from a variety of biological tissues and materials where
    site-specific mechanical properties are generated for enhanced protection by adopting
    gradients in structural orientation over multiple length-scales, without manipulation
    of composition or microstructural dimension. Quantitative correlations are established
    between the structural orientations and local mechanical properties, such as stiffness,
    strength and fracture resistance; based on such gradients, the underlying mechanisms
    for the enhanced protective role of these materials are clarified. Theoretical
    analysis is presented and corroborated through numerical simulations of the indentation
    behavior of composites with distinct orientations. The design strategy of such
    bioinspired gradients is outlined in terms of the geometry of constituents. This
    study may offer a feasible approach towards generating functionally graded mechanical
    properties in synthetic materials for improved contact damage resistance. Statement
    of Significance Living organisms are adept at resisting contact damage by assembling
    protective surfaces with spatially varied mechanical properties, i.e., by creating
    functionally-graded materials. Such gradients, together with multiple length-scale
    hierarchical structures, represent the prime characteristics of many biological
    materials. Here, we examine one design motif from a variety of biological tissues
    where site-specific mechanical properties are generated for enhanced protection
    by adopting gradients in structural orientation at multiple length-scales, without
    changes in composition or microstructural dimension. The design strategy of such
    bioinspired gradients is outlined in terms of the geometry of constituents. This
    study may offer a feasible approach towards generating functionally-graded mechanical
    properties in synthetic materials for improved damage resistance.

    there is a marked convergence of the interests of international heritage bodies
    managing World Heritage and the Lao authorities anxious to portray a particular
    vision of national identity through selective recognition of cultural heritage

  page: 372-381
  volume: '9'

  abstract: In this paper, we report on a new technology used to implement strain
    sensors to be integrated in usual garments. A particular conductive mixture based
    on commercial products is realized and directly spread over a piece of fabric,
    which shows, after the treatment, piezoresistive properties, i.e., a change in
    resistance when it is strained. This property is exploited to realize sensorized
    garments such as gloves, leotards, and seat covers capable of reconstructing and
    monitoring body shape, posture, and gesture. In general, this technology is a
    good candidate for adherent wearable systems with excellent mechanical coupling
    with body surface. Here, we mainly focused on a sensorized glove able to detect
    posture and movements of the fingers. It could be used in several fields of application.
    We report on experimental results of a sensorized glove used as movements recorder
    for rehabilitation therapies and medicine. Furthermore, we describe a dedicated
    methodology used to read the output sensors which allowed to avoid using metallic
    wires for the connections. The price to be paid for all these advantages is a
    nonlinear electric response of the fabric sensor and a too long settling time,
    that in principle, make these sensors not suitable for real-time applications.
    Here we propose a hardware and computational solution to overcome this limitation.

  abstract: Biomimetic robots borrow their senses and structure from animals, such
    as insects, fish and birds. Development of underwater vehicles is one of the areas
    where biomimetic robots can potentially perform better than conventional robots.
    In this paper, the biomimetic design and the workspace study of undulating fin
    propulsion mechanisms are considered and discussed. We are interested in fish
    with long and/or wide undulating body/fin - especially those of anguilliform,
    amiiform, rajiform, and gymnotiform. Two major mechanism layouts developed to
    mimetic fin undulations of real fish are compared and discussed. Various kinematics
    expressions of fin waves are presented and the model’s limitation is also discussed.
    For a parametric study, the geometry of a single fin segment of the assembled
    fin mechanisms and the fin wave generated are first developed. Next, the fin workspace
    of the single fin segment is derived based on a defined area ratio. By virtue
    of the obtained fin dimensions, a gymnotiform robot, Nanyang knifefish (NKF-II),
    has been designed and constructed. With the fin-ray linkages with sliders connecting
    in series, the fish robot is able to generate arbitrary undulating waveforms.
    The robot’s maneuvering and its depth control have also been achieved by the integration
    of a buoyancy tank with the undulating fin mechanisms. Initial pool testing has
    been conducted to demonstrate the basic performance of the fish robot underwater.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a locomotion control implementation of a robotic
    system mimicking the undulating fins of fish. To mimic the actual flexible fin
    of a real fish, we created a ribbon fin type actuation device with a series of
    connecting linkages and attached it to the robotic fish. By virtue of a specially
    designed strip with a slider, each link is able to turn and slide with respect
    to the adjacent link. The driving linkages are used to form a mechanical fin consisting
    of several fin segments, which are able to produce undulations, similar to those
    produced by actual fins. By virtue of the modular and reconfigurable fin mechanisms,
    two robotic fish with different fin layouts have been designed and constructed:
    The first prototype is a robotic stingray, swimming by undulations of a pair of
    lateral fins; the second is a robotic knifefish, swimming by undulations of a
    long anal fin. The locomotion scheme and mechatronics implementation of the robotic
    stingray are presented and discussed with a parametric study of the slider’s workspace
    and joint trajectory. Some experimental observations of the robotic knifefish
    are also shown and discussed. The results demonstrate that the designed fin mechanisms
    are able to undulate sections of pectoral and anal fins, with different amplitudes
    and phases, along the length of the fin in the direction of motion. This may lead
    to further developments that better mimic the fin locomotion capability of real
    fish.'

    fill the bucket. In this paper, we extend the state of the art in two ways. First,
    we present a reformulated version of the classical fundamental equation of earthmoving
    often used to model soil-tool interaction. The new model includes consideration
    of previously unaccounted phenomena in the interaction of an excavator bucket
    as it moves through soil. Secondly, given that soil properties can vary even within
    a work site, we present an online method to estimate soil parameters from measured
    force data. Finally, we show how the predicted resistive force is used to estimate
    bucket trajectories

  abstract: Programmable locomotion of responsive hydrogels has gained increasing
    attention for potential applications in soft robotics, microfluidic components,
    actuators, and artificial muscle. Modulation of hydrogel pore structures is essential
    for tailoring their mechanical strength, response speeds, and motion behaviors.
    Conventional methods forming hydrogels with homogeneous or stepwise-distributed
    pore structures are limited by the required compromise to simultaneously optimize
    these aspects. Here, a heterobifunctional crosslinker enabled hydrothermal process
    is introduced to synthesize responsive hydrogels with well-defined gradient pore
    construction. According to gradient porosity controls, the hydrogels simultaneously
    exhibit rapid responses to external stimuli, high elasticity/compressibility,
    and programmable locomotion capability. By incorporating polypyrrole nanoparticles
    as photothermal transducers, photo/thermal responsive composite hydrogels are
    formed to enable programmable control of locomotion such as bending, curving,
    twisting, and octopus-like swimming under near-infrared laser stimulation. The
    tunable pore structures, mechanical properties, and locomotion of this new class
    of materials make these gradient porous hydrogels potentially suitable for a variety
    of applications.

  abstract: An approach is presented whereby small, unmanned aircraft can land on
    walls. The approach is demonstrated with a plane that uses an ultrasonic sensor
    to initiate a pitch-up maneuver as it flies toward a wall. The plane contacts
    the wall with spines that engage asperities on the surface. A non-linear suspension
    absorbs the kinetic energy while keeping the spines attached. A planar dynamic
    model is used to evaluate pitch-up maneuvers and determine suspension parameters
    that satisfy constraints on the contact forces for a range of flight velocities.
    Simulations conducted using the model are compared with data obtained using high-speed
    video and a force plate embedded in a wall.

  abstract: 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Hydrogels such as poly(ethylene
    glycol) diacrylate are a class of cross-linked polymers that have the ability
    to absorb water and change volume. Here, a humidity responsiveness of hydrogel
    film fabricated by the photopolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate
    (PEG-DA) monomer is reported. This kind of film could be driven by a small humidity
    gradient, thus spontaneous deformation and motion can be achieved by placing the
    film onto a moist filter paper. The influence factors of humidity response sensitivity
    such as the exposure time and number-average molecular weight of PEG-DA monomer
    used during the fabrication are investigated. Under different relative humidity,
    the film displays different degrees of pink color and the intensities of fluorescence
    under 365 nm illumination are also different, which renders the film to be used
    as a “humidity test strip.” A humidity-driven walking device is fabricated and
    the walking velocity is about 3 mm min −1 under the actuating water vapor. Vapor
    of volatile polar solvents could also drive the actuator to achieve fast deformation
    and shows the variety of the film responsivity.

  volume: '32'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: 'Many natural phenomena consist of geometric elements with dynamic motions
    characterized by small scale repetitions over large scale structures, such as
    particles, herds, threads, and sheets. Due to their ubiquity, controlling the
    appearance and behavior of such phenomena is important for a variety of graphics
    applications. However, such control is often challenging; the repetitive elements
    are often too numerous for manual edit, while their overall structures are often
    too versatile for fully automatic computation. We propose a method that facilitates
    easy and intuitive controls at both scales: high-level structures through spatial-temporal
    output constraints (e.g. overall shape and motion of the output domain), and low-level
    details through small input exemplars (e.g. element arrangements and movements).
    These controls are suitable for manual specification, while the corresponding
    geometric and dynamic repetitions are suitable for automatic computation. Our
    system takes such user controls as inputs, and generates as outputs the corresponding
    repetitions satisfying the controls. Our method, which we call dynamic element
    textures, aims to produce such controllable repetitions through a combination
    of constrained optimization (satisfying controls) and data driven computation
    (synthesizing details). We use spatial-temporal samples as the core representation
    for dynamic geometric elements. We propose analysis algorithms for decomposing
    small scale repetitions from large scale themes, as well as synthesis algorithms
    for generating outputs satisfying user controls. Our method is general, producing
    a range of artistic effects that previously required disparate and specialized
    techniques.'

  abstract: 'Laboratory-based courses play a critical role in scientific education.
    Automation is changing the nature of these laboratories, and there is a long-running
    debate about the value of hands-on versus simulated laboratories. In addition,
    the introduction of remote laboratories adds a third category to the debate. Through
    a review of the literature related to these labs in education, the authors draw
    several conclusions about the state of current research. The debate over different
    technologies is confounded by the use of different educational objectives as criteria
    for judging the laboratories: Hands-on advocates emphasize design skills, while
    remote lab advocates focus on conceptual understanding. We observe that the boundaries
    among the three labs are blurred in the sense that most laboratories are mediated
    by computers, and that the psychology of presence may be as important as technology.
    We also discuss areas for future research. \[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\] Copyright

    all blocks are identical; instead the unique combinations and positions of Bitblox
    within an assembly determine the mechanical and electrical properties of the assembly.
    We describe the design details of Bitblox, compare them to similar materials,
    and demonstrate their use in a working three-dimensional printer through several
    examples.

  abstract: — This work introduces a novel technique for fabri-cating functional robots
    using 3D printers. Simultaneously de-positing photopolymers and a non-curing liquid
    allows complex, pre-filled fluidic channels to be fabricated. This new printing
    capability enables complex hydraulically actuated robots and robotic components
    to be automatically built, with no assem-bly required. The technique is showcased
    by printing linear bellows actuators, gear pumps, soft grippers and a hexapod
    robot, using a commercially-available 3D printer. We detail the steps required
    to modify the printer and describe the design constraints imposed by this new
    fabrication approach.

  container-title: IEEE international conference on robotics and automation
  page: 2462-2469
  volume: '3'
  abstract: Dynamic grasping force control for a multifingered hand is proposed and
    investigated. The grasping force of the finger is dynamically adjusted according
    to the tactile feedback so that each fingertip force always stays inside the friction
    cone detected by the tactile sensor and the fingertips maintain firm contact without
    any undesired slip no detaching from the surface of the object while grasping
    it. The proposed method can be applied for real-time control of the hand since
    it requires few numerical calculations. The validity of the proposed method is
    experimentally confirmed using a two-fingered hand with finger-shaped tactile
    sensors.

  container-title: The International Journal of Robotics Research
  page: 1577-1584
  volume: '32'
  issue: '13'
  abstract: A pneumatically-driven robot traverses surfaces with different traction
    by adopting an undulatory mode of locomotion. The robot is composed of soft elastomer
    (elastic modulus $\sim$100 kPa), an inextensible but flexible neutral plane, and
    embedded pneumatic channels. In contrast to conventional robots and wheeled vehicles,
    the robot deforms elastically to make ground contact over a relatively large area,
    where interfacial tractions have a unique role in controlling both the speed and
    direction of locomotion. Here, we demonstrate that for the same undulatory gait,
    the robot will either move forward or backward depending on the ground composition.
    Building on mathematical principles of elasticity and friction, we introduce a
    theoretical model that identifies the tribological properties that determine the
    direction of locomotion. Though overlooked in the past, this tribology-controlled
    phenomenon represents a central feature of undulation on smooth, soft, and slippery
    surfaces. These insights provide a starting point for identifying locomotion strategies
    that allow soft robots, like their natural invertebrate counterparts, to navigate
    a broad range of surfaces and terrains.

  page: 16994-9
  volume: '105'
  issue: '44'
  abstract: A fundamental but unanswered biological question asks how much energy,
    on average, Earth’s different life forms spend per unit mass per unit time to
    remain alive. Here, using the largest database to date, for 3,006 species that
    includes most of the range of biological diversity on the planet-from bacteria
    to elephants, and algae to sapling trees-we show that metabolism displays a striking
    degree of homeostasis across all of life. We demonstrate that, despite the enormous
    biochemical, physiological, and ecological differences between the surveyed species
    that vary over 10(20)-fold in body mass, mean metabolic rates of major taxonomic
    groups displayed at physiological rest converge on a narrow range from 0.3 to
    9 W kg(-1). This 30-fold variation among life’s disparate forms represents a remarkably
    small range compared with the 4,000- to 65,000-fold difference between the mean
    metabolic rates of the smallest and largest organisms that would be observed if
    life as a whole conformed to universal quarter-power or third-power allometric
    scaling laws. The observed broad convergence on a narrow range of basal metabolic
    rates suggests that organismal designs that fit in this physiological window have
    been favored by natural selection across all of life’s major kingdoms, and that
    this range might therefore be considered as optimal for living matter as a whole.

  issue: July
  abstract: The desert-dwelling sandfish (Scincus scincus) moves within dry sand,
    a material that displays solid and fluidlike behavior. High-speed x-ray imaging
    shows that below the surface, the lizard no longer uses limbs for propulsion but
    generates thrust to overcome drag by propagating an undulatory traveling wave
    down the body. Although viscous hydrodynamics can predict swimming speed in fluids
    such as water, an equivalent theory for granular drag is not available. To predict
    sandfish swimming speed, we developed an empirical model by measuring granular
    drag force on a small cylinder oriented at different angles relative to the displacement
    direction and summing these forces over the animal movement profile. The agreement
    between model and experiment implies that the noninertial swimming occurs in a
    frictional fluid.

  abstract: Current Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) technologies can manufacture,
    directly from digital data, end-use mechanical parts in an increasingly wide variety
    of engineering materials. However, commercial SFF systems remain costly, complex,
    proprietary, and are limited to working with one or two proprietary materials
    during the course of building a part, hindering their broader application and
    the impact of the technology. The work we present here demonstrates (1) that SFF
    systems can employ many materials and multiple processes during the course of
    building a single object, (2) that such systems can produce complete, active,
    electromechanical devices, rather than only mechanical parts, and (3) that such
    multi-material SFF systems can be made accessible to, and are of interest to the
    general public. We have developed a research- oriented, multi-material SFF system
    and employed it to produce not only mechanical parts, but complete and functional
    Zn-air batteries, electrical wiring, flexible circuit boards, strain- gages, electromagnets,
    electroactive polymer actuators, organic-polymer transistors, and electromechanical
    relays. We have also developed and published the Fab\@Home Model 1 open-source,
    multi-material, freeform fabrication system design. The Fab\@Home project has
    received broad public and media attention, and more than 100 Model 1 machines
    have been built by individuals around the world.

  container-title: Journal of Mechanical Design
  page: 667-672
  volume: '126'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: This paper introduces a novel contact-aided compliant mechanism that uses
    intermittent contacts to convert a single translatory reciprocating input into
    two output curves, which intersect to enclose a two dimensional region. Contact
    interactions endow contact-aided compliant mechanisms with enhanced kinematic
    and kinetostatic capabilities. The mechanism described in this paper is designed
    to undergo large deformations repeatedly, without yielding by avoiding flexural
    joints and by using contacts to obtain the desired deformation. A single-material,
    joint-free and planar design makes the mechanism easy and economical to fabricate
    at the macro or micro scales. The design is validated experimentally by manufacturing
    and testing macro scale prototypes. Two potential applications that motivated
    this mechanism are also noted

  abstract: This article discusses the current use of virtual reality tools and their
    potential in science and engineering education. One programming tool in particular,
    the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is presented in light of its applications
    and possibilities in the development of computer visualization tools for education.
    VRML can be combined with other software development tools to create interactive
    dynamic computer graphics to assist in the teaching and understanding of scientific
    and technological principles. One contribution of this article is to present software
    tools and provide examples that may encourage educators to develop virtual reality
    models to enhance teaching in their own discipline.

  abstract: The need for building robots with soft materials emerged recently from
    considerations of the limitations of service robots in negotiating natural environments,
    from observation of the role of compliance in animals and plants \[1\], and even
    from the role attributed to the physical body in movement control and intelligence,
    in the so-called embodied intelligence or morphological computation paradigm \[2\]-\[4\].
    The wide spread of soft robotics relies on numerous investigations of diverse
    materials and technologies for actuation and sensing, and on research of control
    techniques, all of which can serve the purpose of building robots with high deformability
    and compliance. But the core challenge of soft robotics research is, in fact,
    the variability and controllability of such deformability and compliance.

  abstract: A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) DNA sensor, based on the nanoparticle
    amplification method, was developed for detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7.
    A thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe specific to E. coli O157:H7 eaeA
    gene was immobilized onto the QCM sensor surface through self-assembly. The hybridization
    was induced by exposing the ssDNA probe to the complementary target DNA, and resulted
    in the mass change and therefore frequency change of the QCM. Streptavidin conjugated
    Fe3O4 nanoparticles (average diameter = 145 nm) were used as "mass enhancers"
    to amplify the frequency change. Synthesized biotinylated oligonucleotides as
    well as E. coli O157:H7 eaeA gene fragments (151 bases) amplified using asymmetric
    PCR with biotin labeled primers were tested. As low as 10-12 M synthesized oligonucleotides
    and 2.67 × 102 colony forming unit (CFU)/ml E. coli O157:H7 cells can be detected
    by the sensor. Linear correlation between frequency change and logarithmic number
    of bacterial cell concentration was found for E. coli O157:H7 from 2.67 × 102
    to 2.67 × 106 CFU/ml. 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

    Shape Memory Polymers</span>
  container-title: Scientific Reports
  publisher: Nature Publishing Group
  page: '13616'
  volume: '5'
  abstract: Folding is ubiquitous in nature with examples ranging from the formation
    of cellular components to winged insects. It finds technological applications
    including packaging of solar cells and space structures, deployable biomedical
    devices, and self-assembling robots and airbags. Here we demonstrate sequential
    self-folding structures realized by thermal activation of spatially-variable patterns
    that are 3D printed with digital shape memory polymers, which are digital materials
    with different shape memory behaviors. The time-dependent behavior of each polymer
    allows the temporal sequencing of activation when the structure is subjected to
    a uniform temperature. This is demonstrated via a series of 3D printed structures
    that respond rapidly to a thermal stimulus, and self-fold to specified shapes
    in controlled shape changing sequences. Measurements of the spatial and temporal
    nature of self-folding structures are in good agreement with the companion finite
    element simulations. A simplified reduced-order model is also developed to rapidly
    and accurately describe the self-folding physics. An important aspect of self-folding
    is the management of self-collisions, where different portions of the folding
    structure contact and then block further folding. A metric is developed to predict
    collisions and is used together with the reduced-order model to design self-folding
    structures that lock themselves into stable desired configurations.

  abstract: 'In this work we describe an autonomous soft-bodied robot that is both
    self-contained and capable of rapid, continuum-body motion. We detail the design,
    modeling, fabrication, and control of the soft fish, focusing on enabling the
    robot to perform rapid escape responses. The robot employs a compliant body with
    embedded actuators emulating the slender anatomical form of a fish. In addition,
    the robot has a novel fluidic actuation system that drives body motion and has
    all the subsystems of a traditional robot onboard: power, actuation, processing,
    and control. At the core of the fish’s soft body is an array of fluidic elastomer
    actuators. We design the fish to emulate escape responses in addition to forward
    swimming because such maneuvers require rapid body accelerations and continuum-body
    motion. These maneuvers showcase the performance capabilities of this self-contained
    robot. The kinematics and controllability of the robot during simulated escape
    response maneuvers are analyzed and compared with studies on biological fish.
    We show that during escape responses, the soft-bodied robot has similar input-output
    relationships to those observed in biological fish. The major implication of this
    work is that we show soft robots can be both self-contained and capable of rapid
    body motion.'

    methods with a priori articulation of preferences, methods with a posteriori articulation
    of preferences, and methods with no articulation of preferences. Genetic algorithms
    are surveyed as well. Commentary is provided on three fronts, concerning the advantages
    and pitfalls of individual methods, the different classes of methods, and the
    field of MOO as a whole. The Characteristics of the most significant methods are
    summarized. Conclusions are drawn that reflect often-neglected ideas and applicability
    to engineering problems. It is found that no single approach is superior. Rather,

  abstract: During the last decade, computer-aided process planning (CAPP) has received
    much attention both from researchers and practitioners. One of the reasons for
    this is the role of CAPP in reducing throughput time and improving quality. An
    attempt has been made in this paper to review the existing literature with the
    objective of gaining insights into the design and implementation of CAPP systems.
    The literature available (1989–1996) on CAPP has been reviewed based on the types
    of systems. The advantages and disadvantages of such systems are presented. Finally,
    future research directions are indicated.

    five force levels based on visual feedback. Seventeen positions on the wrist and
    hand were monitored to quantify kinematics. Hand shaping began with initiation
    of reach and continued throughout the reach, matching object properties even without
    vision of the hand or object. Grasp aperture scaled to object size. Singular value

  abstract: This paper studies a form of robotic fish movement that is analogous to
    the Carangiform style of swimming seen in nature. We propose a simple quasi-steady
    fluid flow model for predicting the thrust generated by the flapping tail. We
    then describe an experimental system, consisting of a three-link robot, that has
    been constructed in order to study carangiform-like swimming. Experimental results
    obtained with this system suggest that the simplified propulsion model is reasonably
    accurate. The input parameters that realize optimum thrust are experimentally
    determined. Finally, we consider some issues in maneuvering.

    Although most amputees consider this performance as acceptable for usual tasks,
    there is ample room for improvement by exploiting recent progresses in mechatronic
    design and technology. This paper focus on an innovative approach for the design
    and development of prosthetic hands based on underactuated mechanisms. Furthermore,
    it describes the development and a preliminary analysis of a first prototype of
    an underactuated prosthetic hand.

  abstract: 'The rostral part of the agranular frontal cortex (area 6) can be subdivided
    on the basis of its cytoarchitecture, enzymatic properties, and connections into
    two large sectors: a superior region, lying medial to the spur of the arcuate
    sulcus, and an inferior region, lying lateral to it. In this study we traced the
    afferent and efferent connections of the inferior region of area 6 by injecting
    small amounts of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP)
    and fluorescent tracers (fast blue and diamidino yellow) into restricted parts
    of inferior area 6 and in physiologically determined fields of area 4. There is
    an ordered topographic pattern of connections between inferior area 6 and area
    4. The region near the spur of the arcuate sulcus (hand field) projects to the
    area 4 hand field while the lateral part of inferior area 6 (mouth field) is connected
    with the corresponding field in area 4. The organization of the connections between
    the two fields is, however, different. The hand fields in area 6 and 4 have direct
    reciprocal projections, whereas the mouth field in the postarcuate cortex relays
    information to area 4 via a zone intermediate between the arcuate and the central
    sulcus. This zone corresponds to the cytochrome oxidase area F4 (Matelli, Luppino,
    and Rizzolatti: Behav. Brain Res. 18: 125-137, ’85). The inferior area 6 also
    has topographically organized connections with the supplementary motor area. The
    inferior area 6 receives and sends fibers to a series of discrete cortical areas
    located in the lower cortical moiety (Sanides: The Structure and Function of the
    Nervous Tissue, Vol. 5. New York: Academic Press, pp 329-453, ’72). These areas
    that form a broad ring around the central sulcus are the ventral bank of the principal
    sulcus and the adjacent area 46, the precentral operculum (PrOC), area SII (Jones
    and Burton: J. Comp. Neurol. 168:197-248, ’76), the parietal operculum, and the
    rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule including the lower bank of the intraparietal
    sulcus. Finally, the inferior area 6 has sparse but consistent connections with
    insular and cingulate cortices. The functional significance of this complex pattern
    of connections is discussed.'

  abstract: To face the emerging issues raised by bacterial infections in biomedical,
    food and environmental contexts, the combination of nanotechnologies and biosensors
    characteristics is increasingly seen as a promising tool to develop rapid, highly
    sensitive and specific devices for reliable bacterial detection and quantification.
    We present here the design of an electrochemical immuno-biosensor, integrating
    non cytotoxic silica nanoparticles (NPs), in a two-step spin coating process.
    Unlike biosensors that integrate a unique antibody-based layer without NPs, this
    new tool allows, through cyclic voltammetry measurements, the continuous and non-saturated
    detection of E. coli bacteria in only 5 min. and can reach up to 10 3 CFU/mL in
    30 min. It offers great promises for industrial purposes as electrode functionalization
    is rather simple and its architecture can be tuned on demand to target a variety
    of micro-organisms, and the highlighted indicators (variations of current intensity,
    intensity ratios and/or difference of potentials)can easily be implemented in
    a screen displayed packaging.

  container-title: Bioinspiration & biomimetics
  page: '026007'
  volume: '8'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: To discover principles of flipper-based terrestrial locomotion we study
    the mechanics of a hatchling sea turtle-inspired robot, FlipperBot (FBot), during
    quasi-static movement on granular media. FBot implements a symmetric gait using
    two servo-motor-driven front limbs with flat-plate flippers and either freely
    rotating or fixed wrist joints. For a range of gaits, FBot moves with a constant
    step length. However, for gaits with sufficiently shallow flipper penetration
    or sufficiently large stroke, per step displacement decreases with each successive
    step resulting in failure (zero forward displacement) within a few steps. For
    the fixed wrist, failure occurs when FBot interacts with ground disturbed during
    previous steps, and measurements reveal that flipper generated forces decrease
    as per step displacement decreases. The biologically inspired free wrist is less
    prone to failure, but slip-induced failure can still occur if FBot pitches forward
    and drives its leading edge into the substrate. In the constant step length regime,
    kinematic and force-based models accurately predict FBot’s motion for free and
    fixed wrist configurations, respectively. When combined with independent force
    measurements, models and experiments provide insight into how disturbed ground
    leads to locomotory failure and help explain differences in hatchling sea turtle
    performance.

  container-title: Bioinspiration & Biomimetics
  page: '025005'
  volume: '7'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Soft robotics is a current focus in robotics research because of the expected
    capability of soft robots to better interact with real-world environments. As
    a point of inspiration in the development of innovative technologies in soft robotics,
    octopuses are particularly interesting ’animal models’. Octopus arms have unique
    biomechanical capabilities that combine significant pliability with the ability
    to exert a great deal of force, because they lack rigid structures but can change
    and control their degree of stiffness. The octopus arm motor capability is a result
    of the peculiar arrangement of its muscles and the properties of its tissues.
    These special abilities have been investigated by the authors in a specific study
    dedicated to identifying the key principles underlying these biological functions
    and deriving engineering requirements for robotics solutions. This paper, which
    is the second in a two-part series, presents how the identified requirements can
    be used to create innovative technological solutions, such as soft materials,
    mechanisms and actuators. Experiments indicate the ability of these proposed solutions
    to ensure the same performance as in the biological model in terms of compliance,
    elongation and force. These results represent useful and relevant components of
    innovative soft-robotic systems and suggest their potential use to create a new
    generation of highly dexterous, soft-bodied robots.

  abstract: Especially in robotics, rarely plants have been considered as a model
    of inspiration for designing and developing new technology. This is probably due
    to their radically different operational principles compared to animals and the
    difficulty to study their movements and features. Owing to the sessile nature
    of their lifestyle, plants have evolved the capabil- ity to respond to a wide
    range of signals and efficiently adapt to changing environmental conditions. Plants
    in fact are able to show considerable plasticity in their morphology and physiology
    in response to variability within their environment. This results in movements
    that are characterized by energy efficiency and high density. Plant materials
    are optimized to reduce energy consumption during motion and these capabilities
    offer a plethora of solutions in the artificial world, exploiting approaches that
    are muscle-free and thus not necessarily animal-like. Plant roots then are excellent
    natural diggers, and their character- istics such as adaptive growth, low energy
    consumption movements, and the capability of penetrating soil at any angle are
    interesting from an engineering perspective. A few examples are described to lay
    the perspectives of plants in the artificial world.

  abstract: This paper presents an analysis of force data that was generated by a
    human demonstration of a complex and asymmetrical insertion task. The human was
    blindfolded. And only had force sensors (i.e. fingers) available. The process
    is modelled using hybrid dynamics which highlighted the changes in contact as
    the essential parts of the assembly process. Qualitative reasoning is then applied
    to the force signals to identify those portions of the force signals that corresponded
    to either a gain or a loss of contact. The emphasis of the paper is to understand
    the force signals generated by the human subject. It is shown that qualitative
    reasoning proves to be a simple, efficient and effective means to understand the
    force signal by identifying the changes in contact state. Qualitative reasoning
    is also shown to be suitable for automated industrial assembly

  page: 1-15
  abstract: Additive Manufacturing (AM) allows designers to create intricate geometries
    that were once too complex or expensive to achieve through traditional manufacturing
    processes. Currently, Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) is restricted to
    experts in the field, and novices may overlook potentially transformational design
    potential enabled by AM. This project aims to make DfAM accessible to a broader
    audience through deep learning, enabling designers of all skill levels to leverage
    unique AM geometries when creating new designs. To demonstrate such an approach,
    a database of files was acquired from industry-sponsored AM challenges focused
    on lightweight design. These files were converted to a voxelized format, which
    provides more robust information for machine learning applications. Next, an autoencoder
    was constructed to a low-dimensional representation of the part designs. Finally,
    that autoencoder was used to construct a deep neural network capable of predicting
    various DfAM attributes. This work demonstrates a novel foray towards a more extensive
    DfAM support system that supports designers at all experience levels.

  container-title: Journal of Biomechanics
  volume: '3'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: The trout’s tail fin is flexible, yet it propels the trout. It can do
    so because the flexibility is of a special, limited kind. The tail fin is not
    simply a sheet of compliant material. Instead it is supported by bony rays, each
    of which is a flexible girder. These girders can bend in agreement with the hydrodynamic
    load, but when they do so their structure requires that they steer the fin as
    a whole in opposition to the load. The fin automatically adjusts its camber so
    that the shape of the distribution of hydrodynamic load upon it is the same whatever
    the speed of the fish and whatever the path of the tail fin through the water
    - unless, as may be the case, parts of the swimming cycle demand a bend sharper
    than the fin can accomodate. If the latter occurs, cyclic variations in load distribution
    will result. These may be needed if the tail is to generate the forces required
    to match the body mechanically at every part of the cycle. 1970.

  abstract: Tightly integrating sensing, actuation, and computation into composites
    could enable a new generation of truly smart material systems that can change
    their appearance and shape autonomously. Applications for such materials include
    airfoils that change their aerodynamic profile, vehicles with camouflage abilities,
    bridges that detect and repair damage, or robotic skins and prosthetics with a
    realistic sense of touch. Although integrating sensors and actuators into composites
    is becoming increasingly common, the opportunities afforded by embedded computation
    have only been marginally explored. Here, the key challenge is the gap between
    the continuous physics of materials and the discrete mathematics of computation.
    Bridging this gap requires a fundamental understanding of the constituents of
    such robotic materials and the distributed algorithms and controls that make these
    structures smart.

  abstract: We present a distributed algorithm to calculate inverse kinematic solutions
    for shape-changing beams with integrated sensing, actuation, computation and communication.
    We consider the beam to consist of n segments that can each change their curvature,
    perform computation and communicate with their neighbors. Using a centralized
    inverse Jacobian method this solution has a computational complexity of (n2.373)
    as it relies on matrix inversion. We describe the system as a kinematic chain
    and derive a distributed algorithm for computing its inverse kinematics. The presented
    method distributes the computation among the n segments by sequentially applying
    the inverse Jacobian method to m-segment neighborhoods, reducing the computational
    complexity of each individual operation to m3) at the expense of mn) communication
    exchanges and solving the reduced problems ) times across the length of the beam.
    The resulting solution does not require any external computation and can autonomously
    calculate a curvature profile to reach a desired end-pose, which has applications
    ranging from adaptive aerodynamic surfaces to smart furniture. The proposed algorithm
    has been validated using computer simulations of beams with up to 30 elements
    and various neighborhood sizes. Results show that the proposed approach allows
    trading accuracy and converge rate with increasing computation and communication.

  abstract: Geometric scaling transformations do not respect the biological processes
    which govern the size and shape of living creatures. In this paper, we describe
    an approach to scaling which can be related to biological function. We use known
    biological laws of allometry which are expressed as power laws to control the
    mesh deformation in the frequency domain. This approach is motivated by the relation
    between fractal biological systems and their underlying power-law spectra. We
    demonstrate our approach to biology-aware character scaling on triangle meshes
    representing quadrupedal mammals. 2011 The Authors Computer Graphics Forum 2011

    robots that can achieve dynamic walking gaits that are stable. Reducing the DOF
    in a biped can result in a reduction in the complexity of the control strategies
    needed to enable stable walking. Although the biped designed by this procedure
    is restricted to a single gait, this biped may be less complex, lighter, and less
    costly to construct than one whose multiple DOFs are coordinated via feedback.

  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'This paper describes the experiences of using an advanced, low-cost robot
    in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. It presents
    three innovations: It is a powerful, cheap, robust, and small advanced personal
    robot; it forms the foundation of a problem-based learning curriculum; and it
    enables a novel multi-robot curriculum while fostering collaborative team work
    on assignments. The robot design has many features specific to educators: It is
    advanced enough for academic research, has a broad feature set to support a wide
    range of curricula, and is inexpensive enough to be an effective outreach tool.
    The low cost allows each student to have their own robot for the semester, so
    they can work on activities outside the classroom. This robot was used in three
    different classes in which it was the foundation for an innovative problem-based
    learning curriculum. In particular, the robot has specialized sensors and a communications
    system that supports novel multi-robot curricula, which encourage student interaction
    in new ways. The results are promising; the robot was a big success in graduate,
    undergraduate, and outreach activities. Finally, student assessments indicate
    a greater interest and understanding of engineering and other STEM majors, and
    class evaluations were consistently above average. 1963-2012 IEEE.'

  container-title: Journal of Biomechanics
  page: 893-904
  volume: '12'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: A model of running is proposed in which the leg is represented as a rack-and-pinion
    element in series with a damped spring. The rack-and-pinion element emphasizes
    the role of descending commands, while the damped spring represents the dynamic
    properties of muscles and the position and the rate sensitivity of reflexes. This
    model is used to predict separately the effect of track compliance on step length
    and ground contact time. The predictions are compared with experiments in which
    athletes ran over tracks of controlled spring stiffness. A sharp spike in foot
    force up to 5 times body weight was found on hard surfaces, but this spike disappeared
    as the athletes ran on soft experimental tracks. Both ground contact time and
    step length increased on very compliant surfaces, leading to moderately reduced
    running speeds, but a range of track stiffness was discovered which actually enhances
    speed. 1979.

  container-title: ACM Transactions on Graphics
  page: 1-12
  volume: '36'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Fig. 1. Our computational tool for designing compliant mechanisms allows
    non-expert users to generate compliant versions of conventional, rigidly-articulated
    mechanisms. As we demonstrate with a diverse set of examples ranging from a spatial
    wing (left) and steering mechanism (middle) to a compliant hand well-suited for
    teleoperation tasks (right), our technique leads to structurally-sound and function-preserving
    compliant designs. We present a computational tool for designing compliant mechanisms.
    Our method takes as input a conventional, rigidly-articulated mechanism defin-ing
    the topology of the compliant design. This input can be both planar or spatial,
    and we support a number of common joint types which, whenever possible, are automatically
    replaced with parameterized flexures. As the technical core of our approach, we
    describe a number of objectives that shape the design space in a meaningful way,
    including trajectory matching, collision avoidance, lateral stability, resilience
    to failure, and minimizing motor torque. Optimal designs in this space are obtained
    as solutions to an equilibrium-constrained minimization problem that we solve
    using a variant of sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate our method on a set of
    examples that range from simple four-bar linkages to full-fledged animatronics,
    and verify the feasibility of our designs by manufacturing physical prototypes.

  abstract: This work presents a script-based development environment aimed at allowing

    The origami-inspired fabrication process is inexpensive and widely accessible,
    and the tools developed in this work allow for open source design sharing and
    modular reuse. Designs are generated by recursively combining mechanical components
    - from primitive building blocks, through mechanisms and assemblies, to full robots
    - in a flexible yet well-defined manner. This process was used to design robotic
    elements of increasing complexity up to a multi-degree-of-freedom compliant manipulator
    arm, demonstrating the power of this system. The developed system is extensible,
    opening avenues for further research ultimately leading to the development of
    a complete robot compiler.

  container-title: Rapid Prototyping Journal
  page: 872-879
  volume: '24'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: 'Purpose: Material jetting approximates composite material properties
    through deposition of base materials in a dithered pattern. This microscale, voxel-based
    patterning leads to macroscale property changes, which must be understood to appropriately
    design for this additive manufacturing (AM) process. This paper aims to identify
    impacts on these composites’ viscoelastic properties due to changes in base material
    composition and distribution caused by incomplete dithering in small features.
    Design/methodology/approach: Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is used to measure
    viscoelastic properties of two base PolyJet materials and seven “digital materials”.
    This establishes the material design space enabled by voxel-by-voxel control.
    Specimens of decreasing width are tested to explore effects of feature width on
    dithering’s ability to approximate macroscale material properties; observed changes
    are correlated to multi-material distribution via an analysis of ingoing layers.
    Findings: DMA shows storage and loss moduli of preset composites trending toward
    the iso-strain boundary as composition changes. An added iso-stress boundary defines
    the property space achievable with voxel-by-voxel control. Digital materials exhibit
    statistically significant changes in material properties when specimen width is
    under 2 mm. A quantified change in same-material droplet groupings in each composite’s
    voxel pattern shows that dithering requires a certain geometric size to accurately
    approximate macroscale properties. Originality/value: This paper offers the first
    quantification of viscoelastic properties for digital materials with respect to
    material composition and identification of the composite design space enabled
    through voxel-by-voxel control. Additionally, it identifies a significant shift
    in material properties with respect to feature width due to dithering pattern
    changes. This establishes critical design for AM guidelines for engineers designing
    with digital materials.'

  page: 401-6
  volume: '41'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Recently a growing body of evidence has suggested that a functional link
    exists between the hand motor area of the language dominant hemisphere and the
    regions subserving language processing. We examined the excitability of the hand
    motor area and the leg motor area during reading aloud and during non-verbal oral
    movements using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). During reading aloud,
    but not before or afterwards, excitability was increased in the hand motor area
    of the dominant hemisphere. This reading effect was found to be independent of
    the duration of speech. No such effect could be found in the contralateral hemisphere.
    The excitability of the leg area of the motor cortex remained unchanged during
    reading aloud. The excitability during non-verbal oral movements was slightly
    increased in both hemispheres. Our results are consistent with previous findings
    and may indicate a specific functional connection between the hand motor area
    and the cortical language network.

  volume: '149'
  abstract: As mass production has migrated to developing countries, European and
    US companies are forced to rapidly switch towards low volume production of more
    innovative, customised and sustainable products with high added value. To compete
    in this turbulent environment, manufacturers have sought new fabrication techniques
    to provide the necessary tools to support the need for increased flexibility and
    enable economic low volume production. One such emerging technique is Additive
    Manufacturing (AM). AM is a method of manufacture which involves the joining of
    materials, usually layer-upon-layer, to create objects from 3D model data. The
    benefits of this methodology include new design freedom, removal of tooling requirements,
    and economic low volumes. AM consists of various technologies to process versatile
    materials, and for many years its dominant application has been the manufacture
    of prototypes, or Rapid Prototyping. However, the recent growth in applications
    for direct part manufacture, or Rapid Manufacturing, has resulted in much research
    effort focusing on development of new processes and materials. This study focuses
    on the implementation process of AM and is motivated by the lack of socio-technical
    studies in this area. It addresses the need for existing and potential future
    AM project managers to have an implementation framework to guide their efforts
    in adopting this new and potentially disruptive technology class to produce high
    value products and generate new business opportunities. Based on a review of prior
    works and through qualitative case study analysis, we construct and test a normative
    structural model of implementation factors related to AM technology, supply chain,
    organisation, operations and strategy. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  container-title: International Journal of Architectural Computing
  page: 385-403
  volume: '18'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution promises the integration and
    synergy of disciplines to arrive at meaningful and comprehensive solutions. As
    computation and fabrication methods become pervasive, they present platforms for
    communication. Value exists in diverse disciplines bringing their approach to
    a common conversation, proposing demands, and potentials in response to entrenched
    challenges. Robotics has expanded recently as computational analysis, and digital
    fabrication methods are more accurate and reliable. Advances in functional microelectromechanical
    components have resulted in the design of new robots presenting alternatives to
    traditional ambulatory robots. However, most examples are the result of intense
    computational analysis necessitating engineering expertise and specialized manufacturing.
    Accessible fabrication methods like laminate techniques propose alternatives to
    new robot morphologies. However, most examples remain overly actuated without
    harnessing the full potential of folds for locomotion. Our research explores the
    connection between origami structures and kinematics for the generation of an
    ambulatory robot presenting efficient, controlled, and graceful gait with minimal
    use of components. Our robot ‘Crease’ achieves complex gait by harnessing kinematic
    origami chains rather than relying on motors. Minimal actuation activates the
    folds to produce variations in walk and direction. Integrating a physical iterative
    process with computational analysis, several prototypes were generated at different
    scales, including untethered ones with sensing and steering that could map their
    environment. Furthering the dialogue between disciplines, this research contributes
    not only to the field of robotics but also architectural design, where efficiency,
    adjustability, and ease of fabrication are critical in designing kinetic elements.

  container-title: IEEE international conference on robotics and automation
  page: 3383-3388
  abstract: This paper discusses the implementation of complex manipulation tasks
    with a dextrous hand. The approach used is to build a set of primitive manipulation
    functions and combine them to form complex tasks. Only fingertip, or precision,
    manipulations are considered. Each function performs a simple two-dimensional
    translation or rotation that can be generalized to work with objects of different
    sizes and using different grasping forces. Complex tasks are sequential combinations
    of the primitive functions. They are formed by analyzing the workspaces of the
    individual tasks and controlled by finite state machines. We present a number
    of examples, including a complex manipulation removing the top of a child-proof
    medicine bottle-that incorporates different hybrid position/force specifications
    of the primitive functions of which it is composed. The work has been implemented
    with a robot hand system using a Utah-MIT hand.

  volume: '2'
  abstract: We have created a unique tool for grasp simulation, visualization, and
    analysis that allows a user to create and analyze grasps of a given 3D object
    model with a given articulated hand model. The grasps can be performed either
    automatically, where the system closes the fingers around the object at preset
    velocities, ormanually through direct manipulation of the joints. As collisions
    occur between the links of the fingers and the object, the systemlocates the contacts
    and analyzes the evolving grasp on the fly. Each time the grasp changes, the system
    updates two numeric measures of quality and recomputes 3D projections of the grasp
    wrench space which are useful when visualizing a grasp’s capabilities. We provide
    examples of the systembeing used with four different articulated robotic hand
    models, each grasping different object models. We feel the system is very useful
    for hand designerswho prototype differenthand models in simulation and determine
    how design decisions affect a hand’s grasping ability. It is also useful for researchers
    in grasp planning or for simulation and virtual reality designers wishing to perform
    realistic grasping in a virtual setting.

  abstract: Automatic grasp planning for robotic hands is a difficult problem because
    of the huge number of possible hand configurations. However, humans simplify the
    problem by choosing an appropriate prehensile posture appropriate for the object
    and task to be performed. By modeling an object as a set of shape primitives,
    such as spheres, cylinders, cones and boxes, we can use a set of rules to generate
    a set of grasp starting positions and pregrasp shapes that can then be tested
    on the object model. Each grasp is tested and evaluated within our grasping simulator
    "GraspIt!", and the best grasps are presented to the user. The simulator can also
    plan grasps in a complex environment involving obstacles and the reachability
    constraints of a robot arm.

  abstract: The ease of use and versatility of drones has con-tributed to their deployment
    in several fields, from entertainment to search and rescue. However, drones remain
    vulnerable to collisions due to pilot mistakes or various system failures. This
    letter presents a bioinspired strategy for the design of quadcopters resilient
    to collisions. Abstracting the biomechanical strategy of collision re-silient
    insects’ wings, the quadcopter has a dual-stiffness frame that rigidly withstands
    aerodynamic loads within the flight enve-lope, but can soften and fold during
    a collision to avoid damage. The dual-stiffness frame works in synergy with specific

    hosted in the central case. The proposed approach is compared to other state-of-the

    can withstand high-speed collisions.

  abstract: The stiffness of a bag containing particles can be increased by evacuating
    the air inside it. This stiffness-control technology, referred to as granular
    jamming, has been used in force displays. In such displays, the operator feels
    a reaction-force sensation when deforming the bag with a hand motion. The particle-containing
    bag can be deformed into any shape; however, the bag cannot be converted into
    a thin plate. This study proposes a sheet-like mechanism that, rather than particles,
    contains piled-stretch fabrics inside a thin rubber bag. The sheet becomes rigid
    after evacuating the air from the bag, with stiffness proportional to the vacuum
    pressure inside the bag as observed in the granular-jamming method. The sheet
    thickness, which is determined using the number of piled-fabric layers, is approximately
    in the range of 1-5 mm. The softness and stretchability of the sheet allows it
    to form a spherical shape and maintain that shape after vacuuming the inner air.
    This study demonstrates the fundamental properties of a variable-stiffness sheet
    and its applications in force displays.

  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Robotics
  page: 401-410
  volume: '27'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: In this paper, we present a new generation of active tactile modules (i.e.,
    HEX-O-SKIN), which are developed in order to approach multimodal whole-body-touch
    sensation for humanoid robots. To better perform like humans, humanoid robots
    need the variety of different sensory modalities in order to interact with their
    environment. This calls for certain robustness and fault tolerance as well as
    an intelligent solution to connect the different sensory modalities to the robot.
    Each HEX-O-SKIN is a small hexagonal printed circuit board equipped with multiple
    discrete sensors for temperature, acceleration, and proximity. With these sensors,
    we emulate the human sense of temperature, vibration, and light touch. Off-the-shelf
    sensors were utilized to speed up our development cycle; however, in general,
    we can easily extend our design with new discrete sensors, thereby making it flexible
    for further exploration. A local controller on each HEX-O-SKIN preprocesses the
    sensor signals and actively routes data through a network of modules toward the
    closest PC connection. Local processing decreases the necessary network and high-level
    processing bandwidth, while a local analog-to-digital conversion and digital-data
    transfers are less sensitive to electromagnetic interference. With an active data-routing
    scheme, it is also possible to reroute the data around broken connections&\#x2014;yielding
    robustness throughout the global structure while minimizing wirings. To support
    our approach, multiple HEX-O-SKIN are embedded into a rapid-prototyped elastomer
    skin material and redundantly connected to neighboring modules by just four ports.
    The wiring complexity is shifted to each HEX-O-SKIN such that a power and data
    connection between two modules is reduced to four noncrossing wires. Thus, only
    a very simple robot-specific base frame is needed to support and wire the HEX-O-SKIN
    to a robot. The potential of our multimodal sensor modules is demonstrated experimentally
    on a robot platform.

  abstract: 'A miniature robotic device that can fold-up on the spot, accomplish tasks,
    and disappear by degradation into the environment promises a range of medical
    applications but has so far been a challenge in engineering. This work presents
    a sheet that can self-fold into a functional 3D robot, actuate immediately for
    untethered walking and swimming, and subsequently dissolve in liquid. The developed
    sheet weighs 0.31g, spans 1.7cm square in size, features a cubic neodymium magnet,
    and can be thermally activated to self-fold. Since the robot has asymmetric body
    balance along the sagittal axis, the robot can walk at a speed of 3.8 body-length/s
    being remotely controlled by an alternating external magnetic field. We further
    show that the robot is capable of conducting basic tasks and behaviors, including
    swimming, delivering/carrying blocks, climbing a slope, and digging. The developed
    models include an acetone-degradable version, which allows the entire robot’s
    body to vanish in a liquid. We thus experimentally demonstrate the complete life
    cycle of our robot: self-folding, actuation, and degrading'

  abstract: This paper presents a self-folding method for multi-crease structures.
    The proposed method utilizes the symmetric breaking of a 3-layered two-dimensional
    sheet, where an inner contraction sheet induces shear force when heated, which
    directs the inclined folding direction. The fabrication technique developed enables
    distant placements of tiling patterns of the surfaces. The experimental result
    shows that by applying uniform heat, a feature with 62 folds can be simultaneously
    folded, an advantage over manual folding. The method presented is a new instant
    fabrication technique for making semi-rigid structures.

  abstract: The aim of this research is to achieve adaptive carrying behaviors using
    the whole body of a humanoid robot; in other words to create humanoid robots’
    "pick-and-place" behaviors. We developed a small-sized whole-body humanoid robot.
    The robot’s body consists of 22 DOFs, lots of sensors, an onbody micro processor
    network, and a wireless modem. The robot’s brain consists of primitive sensor-motor
    reflex modules running in parallel as a lower layer and an event-driven planner
    that starts/stops appropriate modules as a higher layer. Using this system the
    robot can hold, lift up, and put down various objects without knowing its size,
    hardness or weight. We believe this work will be one of footholds toward achieving
    various whole-body behaviors of humanoid robots, especially carrying behaviors.

  abstract: A mathematical model of the swing phase of walking is presented in this
    paper. The body is represented by three links, one for the stance leg and two
    for the thigh and shank of the swing leg. It is assumed that the muscles act only
    to establish an initial configuration and velocity of the limbs at the beginning
    of the swing phase. The swing leg and the rest of the body then moves through
    the remainder of the swing phase entirely under the action of gravity. The range
    of possible times of swing for each step length is computed for two types of gaits;
    stiff-legged walking and walking with flexion at the knee. The range of times
    of swing found for the model with flexion at the knee are compared with published
    experimental results. The agreement is shown to be very close. Typical histograms
    of forces applied to the ground and angles of the limbs against time are also
    given. The computed forces and angles have the same general time course as those
    found experimentally in normal walking, with the exception of the vertical force,
    which often has a different shape. The limitations of the model apparently responsible
    for this discrepancy are discussed. 1980.

    a pendulum under ledges</span>'
  container-title: PLoS ONE
  volume: '7'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: Escaping from predators often demands that animals rapidly negotiate complex
    environments. The smallest animals attain relatively fast speeds with high frequency
    leg cycling, wing flapping or body undulations, but absolute speeds are slow compared
    to larger animals. Instead, small animals benefit from the advantages of enhanced
    maneuverability in part due to scaling. Here, we report a novel behavior in small,
    legged runners that may facilitate their escape by disappearance from predators.
    We video recorded cockroaches and geckos rapidly running up an incline toward
    a ledge, digitized their motion and created a simple model to generalize the behavior.
    Both species ran rapidly at 12-15 body lengths-per-second toward the ledge without
    braking, dove off the ledge, attached their feet by claws like a grappling hook,
    and used a pendulum-like motion that can exceed one meter-per-second to swing
    around to an inverted position under the ledge, out of sight. We discovered geckos
    in Southeast Asia can execute this escape behavior in the field. Quantification
    of these acrobatic behaviors provides biological inspiration toward the design
    of small, highly mobile search-and-rescue robots that can assist us during natural

    glider using LQR-Trees</span>
  container-title: Bioinspiration and Biomimetics
  volume: '9'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Birds routinely execute post-stall maneuvers with a speed and precision
    far beyond the capabilities of our best aircraft control systems. One remarkable
    example is a bird exploiting post-stall pressure drag in order to rapidly decelerate
    to land on a perch. Stall is typically associated with a loss of control authority,
    and it is tempting to attribute this agility of birds to the intricate morphology
    of the wings and tail, to their precision sensing apparatus, or their ability
    to perform thrust vectoring. Here we ask whether an extremely simple fixed-wing
    glider (no propeller) with only a single actuator in the tail is capable of landing
    precisely on a perch from a large range of initial conditions. To answer this
    question, we focus on the design of the flight control system; building upon previous
    work which used linear feedback control design based on quadratic regulators (LQR),
    we develop nonlinear feedback control based on nonlinear model-predictive control
    and ’LQR-Trees’. Through simulation using a flat-plate model of the glider, we
    find that both nonlinear methods are capable of achieving an accurate bird-like
    perching maneuver from a large range of initial conditions; the ’LQR-Trees’ algorithm
    is particularly useful due to its low computational burden at runtime and its
    inherent performance guarantees. With this in mind, we then implement the ’LQR-Trees’
    algorithm on real hardware and demonstrate a 95 percent perching success rate
    over 147 flights for a wide range of initial speeds. These results suggest that,
    at least in the absence of significant disturbances like wind gusts, complex wing
    morphology and sensing are not strictly required to achieve accurate and robust
    perching even in the post-stall flow regime.

  page: 1-82
  abstract: (第一次提出Moreau timestep method)An approach to the dynamics of mechanical
    systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, involving unilateral constraints,
    is developed. In the n-dimensional linear spaces of forces and velocities, some
    classical concepts of Convex Analysis are used, but no convexity assumption is
    made concerning the constraint inequalities. The velocity is not supposed to be
    a differentiable function of time, but only to have locally bounded variation,
    so the role of the acceleration is held by a n-dimensional measure on the considered
    time interval. Dynamics is then governed by measure differential inclusions, which
    treat possible velocity jumps on the same footing as smooth motions. Possible
    collisions are described as soft, thus dissipative. Friction is taken into account
    under a recently proposed expression of Coulomb’s law. These formulations have
    the advantage of generating numerical algorithms of time-discretization, able
    to handle, in particular, the nonsmooth effects arising from unilaterality and
    from dry friction.

  abstract: Summary form only given. Courses involving a laboratory component are
    conspicuously missing from the recent upsurge in online courses, limiting student
    access to hands-on educational experiences. We present a low-cost, open-hardware
    haptic device, called Hapkit, designed to provide a hands-on laboratory experience
    in an introductory online haptics course. Hapkit is a one-degree-of-freedom kinesthetic
    haptic device that allows users to input motions and feel programmed forces. Based
    on previous haptic paddle designs, Hapkit consists of a motor, magneto-resistive
    sensor and rotating magnet, laser-cut acrylic structure, friction drive, force-sensitive
    resistor, and custom Arduino-based controller board. The CAD files, parts list
    and costs, assembly instructions, and sample software are posted at http://hapkit.stanford.edu
    so the public can both recreate Hapkit and modify its design. The corresponding
    online haptics course, piloted in Autumn 2013, will be available as a self-paced
    course at http://hapticsonline.stanford.edu. In this demonstration, conference
    attendees will be able to assemble and program Hapkits.

  container-title: Advanced Functional Materials
  page: 2163-2170
  volume: '24'
  issue: '15'
  abstract: Soft robots actuated by infl ation of a pneumatic network (a “pneu-net”)
    of small channels in elastomeric materials are appealing for producing sophisticated
    motions with simple controls. Although current designs of pneu-nets achieve motion
    with large amplitudes, they do so relatively slowly (over seconds). This paper
    describes a new design for pneu-nets that reduces the amount of gas needed for
    infl ation of the pneu-net, and thus increases its speed of actuation. A simple
    actuator can bend from a linear to a quasicircular shape in 50 ms when pressurized
    at $\Delta$ P = 345 kPa. At high rates of pressurization, the path along which
    the actuator bends depends on this rate. When infl ated fully, the chambers of
    this new design experience only one-tenth the change in volume of that required
    for the previous design. This small change in volume requires comparably low levels
    of strain in the material at maximum amplitudes of actuation, and commensurately
    low rates of fatigue and failure. This actuator can operate over a million cycles
    without signifi cant degradation of performance. This design for soft robotic
    actuators combines high rates of actuation with high reliability of the actuator,
    and opens new areas of application for them.

    is the task of training a robot to grasp arbitrarily shaped objects. This task
    requires the approximation of a many-to-many mapping, since various configurations
    can be used to grasp an object, and several objects can share the same grasping
    configuration. Experiments in a simulated environment using a 28-object database

  abstract: 'We present LaserOrigami, a rapid prototyping system that produces 3D
    objects using a laser cutter. LaserOrigami is substantially faster than traditional
    3D fabrication techniques such as 3D printing and unlike traditional laser cutting
    the resulting 3D objects require no manual assembly. The key idea behind LaserOrigami
    is that it achieves three-dimensionality by folding and stretching the workpiece,
    rather than by placing joints, thereby eliminating the need for manual assembly.
    LaserOrigami achieves this by heating up selected regions of the workpiece until
    they become compliant and bend down under the force of gravity. LaserOrigami administers
    the heat by defocusing the laser, which distributes the laser’s power across a
    larger surface. LaserOrigami implements cutting and bending in a single integrated
    process by automatically moving the cutting table up and down–when users take
    out the workpiece, it is already fully assembled. We present the three main design
    elements of LaserOrigami: the bend, the suspender, and the stretch, and demonstrate
    how to use them to fabricate a range of physical objects. Finally, we demonstrate
    an interactive fabrication version of LaserOrigami, a process in which user interaction
    and fabrication alternate step-by-step.'

  abstract: 'The agility and ease of control make a quadrotor aircraft an attractive
    platform for studying swarm behavior, modeling, and control. The energetics of
    sustained flight for small aircraft, however, limit typical applications to only
    a few minutes. Adding payloads and the mechanisms used to manipulate them reduces
    this flight time even further. In this paper we present the flying monkey, a novel
    robot platform having three main capabilities: walking, grasping, and flight.
    This new robotic platform merges one of the world’s smallest quadrotor aircraft
    with a lightweight, single-degree-of-freedom walking mechanism and an SMA-actuated
    gripper to enable all three functions in a 30 g package. The main goal and key
    contribution of this paper is to design and prototype the flying monkey that has
    increased mission life and capabilities through the combination of the functionalities
    of legged and aerial robots.'

  abstract: 'A novel classification of planar four-bar linkages is presented based
    on the systematical variation of one, two or three bar lengths and studying the
    transmission properties (input-output curves) of the linkages. This classification
    is better suited to the study of biological systems than the classical Grashof-classification
    used in engineering as it considers the change of structural elements, in evolution
    for example, instead of evaluating the possibilities for the rotation of a particular
    bar. The mechanical features of a wide range of planar linkages in vertebrates,
    described by various authors, have been included in this classification. Examples
    are: skull-levation and jaw-protrusion mechanisms in fishes, reptiles and birds,
    the coral crushing apparatus of parrotfishes, and catapult-mechanisms in feeding
    pipefishes. Four-bar replacement mechanisms, e.g., crank-slider mechanisms in
    feeding systems of fishes and cam-mechanisms in mammalian limb-joints, and more
    complex linkages than four-bar ones, e.g., six-bar linkages and interconnected
    four-bar linkages in fish feeding mechanisms are also discussed. In this way,
    an overview is obtained of the applicability of planar linkage theory in animal
    mechanics to mechanical functioning and the effect of possible variations of bar
    lengths and working ranges in evolution. Four-bar system analysis often provides
    a rigorous method of simplifying the study of complex biological mechanisms. The
    acceptable width-range of necessary and undesired hysteresis (’play’) in biological
    linkages is also discussed.'

    locomotion. The LittleDog platform was designed by Boston Dynamics with funding
    from DARPA to enable rapid advances in the state of the art of rough-terrain locomotion
    algorithms. In addition to providing a fleet of 12 robots with baseline software
    and development tools, LittleDog served as a cross-team common platform that allowed
    direct comparison of results across multiple research teams. Here we report the
    details of this robotic system.

  container-title: IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems
  page: 3239-3246
  volume: 2016-Novem
  abstract: Ribbon folding is a new approach to structure formation that forms higher
    dimensional structures using a lower dimensional primitive, namely a ribbon. In
    this paper, we present a novel algorithm to address path planning for ribbon folding
    of multi-link planar structures. We first represent the desired structure with
    a graph-based representation of edges and nodes. We then use graph theory to claim
    that for any object which is represented by a connected graph, there exists a
    continuous path which visits all of its edges. Finally, we develop a path planning
    algorithm that takes into account the physical constraints of the folding machine.
    The input is the desired planar structure, and the output is the optimal sequence
    of ribbon folds for creating that structure using the minimum number of folds.
    The results of this algorithm are successfully used to fold various planar structures.

  page: 67-77
  volume: '133'

  abstract: This paper proposes application of single and multiple semiactive variable
    stiffness tuned mass dampers (STMD/SMTMD) for response control of multistory structures
    under several types of excitation. A new semiactive control algorithm is developed
    based on real-time frequency tracking of excitation signal by short time Fourier
    transform. A parametric study is performed in the frequency domain to investigate
    the dynamic characteristics and effectiveness of STMDs. Time history responses
    of single-degree-of-freedom and five-degree-of-freedom structures equipped with
    STMDs at the roof level, subjected to harmonic, stationary, and nonstationary
    excitations are presented. STMD/SMTMD are most effective when they have low damping
    ratios and the excitation frequency can be tracked. They are superior than their
    passive counterparts in reducing the response of the main structure both under
    force and base excitations. In case the fundamental frequency changes due to damage
    or deterioration of the main structure then the TMD will be off-tune; hence, it
    will lose its effectiveness significantly, whereas, the STMD is robust against
    such changes as it is always tuned to the excitation frequency. 2007 ASCE.

  abstract: 'There are two major structural paradigms in robotics: soft machines,
    which are conformable, durable, and safe; and traditional rigid robots, which
    are fast, precise, and capable of applying high forces. Here, the paradigms are
    bridged by enabling soft machines to behave like traditional rigid robots on command.
    This task is accomplished via laminar jamming, a structural phenomenon in which
    a laminate of compliant strips becomes strongly coupled through friction when
    a pressure gradient is applied, causing dramatic changes in mechanical properties.
    Rigorous analytical and finite element models of laminar jamming are developed,
    and jamming structures are experimentally characterized to show that the models
    are highly accurate. Then jamming structures are integrated into soft machines
    to enable them to selectively exhibit the stiffness, damping, and kinematics of
    traditional rigid robots. The models allow jamming structures to efficiently meet
    arbitrary performance specifications, and the physical demonstrations illustrate
    how to construct systems that can behave like either soft machines or traditional
    rigid robots at will, such as continuum manipulators that can rapidly have joints
    appear and disappear. This study aims to foster a new generation of mechanically
    versatile machines and structures that cannot simply be classified as “soft” or
    “rigid.”.'

  abstract: This paper describes a developmental approach to the design of a humanoid
    robot. The robot, equipped with initial perceptual and motor competencies, explores
    the "shape" of its own body before devoting its attention to the external environment.
    The initial form of sensorimotor coordination consists of a set of explorative
    motor behaviors coupled to visual routines providing a bottom-up sensory-driven
    attention system. Subsequently, development leads the robot from the construction
    of a "body schema" to the exploration of the world of objects. The "body schema"
    allows controlling the arm and hand to reach and touch objects within the robot’s
    workspace. Eventually, the interaction between the environment and the robot’s
    body is exploited to acquire a visual model of the objects the robot encounters
    which can then be used to guide a top-down attention system.

  container-title: International conference on epigenetic robotics
  abstract: Experimental results in psychology have shown the important role of manipulation
    in guiding infant development. This has inspired work in developmental robotics
    as well. In this case, however, the benefits of this approach have been limited
    by the intrinsic difficulties of the task. Controlling the interaction between
    the robot and the environment in a meaningful and safe way is hard especially
    when little prior knowledge is available. We push the idea that haptic feedback
    can enhance the way robots interact with unmodeled environments. We approach grasping
    and manipulation as tasks driven mainly by tactile and force feedback. We implemented
    a grasping behavior on a robotic platform with sensitive tactile sensors and compliant
    actuators; the behavior allows the robot to grasp objects placed on a table. Finally,
    we demonstrate that the haptic feedback originated by the interaction with the
    objects carries implicit information about their shape and can be useful for learning.

  abstract: 2015 IEEE. We present the design of simple, centimeter-scale modular actuation
    units (’Active Cells’) and passive compliant nodes that are electromechanically
    networked to create macroscopically deformable Modular Active Cell-based Structures
    (MACROs). Each Active Cell is a single degree-of-freedom linear actuator (a ’muscle
    unit’), consisting of fiberglass end-pieces connecting two strands of Nitinol
    shape-memory alloy and a passive biasing spring. The Nitinol strands are coiled
    into a tight spring to increase deformations when activated through resistive
    heating. In-depth examination of the optimization of Nitinol coils with an antagonistic
    spring is presented, resulting in large repeatable axial cell strains of up to

  abstract: Reverse engineering of biological form and function requires hierarchical
    design over several orders of space and time. Recent advances in the mechanistic
    understanding of biosynthetic compound materials, computer-aided design approaches
    in molecular synthetic biology 4,5 and traditional soft robotics, and increasing
    aptitude in generating structural and chemical micro environments that promote
    cellular self-organization have enhanced the ability to recapitulate such hierarchical
    architecture in engineered biological systems. Here we combined these capabilities
    in a systematic design strategy to reverse engineer a muscular pump. We report
    the construction of a freely swimming jellyfish from chemically dissociated rat
    tissue and silicone polymer as a proof of concept. The constructs, termed ’medusoids’,
    were designed with computer simulations and experiments to match key determinants
    of jellyfish propulsion and feeding performance by quantitatively mimicking structural
    design, stroke kinematics and animal-fluid interactions. The combination of the
    engineering design algorithm with quantitative benchmarks of physiological performance
    suggests that our strategy is broadly applicable to reverse engineering of muscular
    organs or simple life forms that pump to survive.

  volume: '96'
  abstract: This work describes a deployable compliant rolling-contact element joint
    (D-CORE joint) that employs curved-folding origami techniques to enable transition
    from a flat to deployed state. These deployable joints can be manufactured from
    a single sheet of material. Two fundamental configurations of the D-CORE are presented.
    The first configuration allows for motion similar to that of a Jacob’s ladder
    when the joint is in a planar state while achieving the motion of a CORE when
    in the deployed state. The second configuration constrains all degrees of freedom
    to create a static structure when the joint is in the planar state and allows
    for the motion of a CORE in the deployed state. Curved-folding origami techniques
    can be used with both configurations to control the cam radius and range of motion
    of the D-CORE. Physical models are demonstrated in Tyvek, polycarbonate, polypropylene,
    and metallic glass. A deployable translating platform constructed of an inversion
    of the D-CORE is also shown.

    Heterogeneous Team</span>
  page: 6323-6330
  abstract: '— In this paper we address the problem of multi-robot localization with
    a heterogeneous team of low-cost mobile robots. The team consists of a single
    centralized observer with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and monocular camera,
    and multiple picket robots with only IMUs and Red Green Blue (RGB) light emitting
    diodes (LED). This team cooperatively navigates a visually featureless environment
    while localizing all robots. A combination of camera imagery captured by the observer
    and IMU measurements from the pickets and observer are fused to estimate motion
    of the team. A team movement strategy, referred to as inchworm, is formulated
    as follows: Pickets move ahead of the observer and then act as temporary landmarks
    for the observer to follow. This cooperative approach employs a single Extended
    Kalman Filter (EKF) to localize the entire heterogeneous multi-robot team, using
    a formulation of the measurement Jacobian to relate the pose of the observer to
    the poses of the pickets with respect to the global reference frame. An initial
    experiment with the inchworm strategy has shown localization within 0.14 m position
    error and 2.18 • orientation error over a path-length of 5 meters in an environment
    with irregular ground, partial occlusions, and a ramp. This demonstrates improvement
    over a camera-only localization technique that was adapted to our team dynamic
    which produced 0.18m position error and 3.12 • orientation error over the same
    dataset. In addition, we demonstrate improvement in localization accuracy with
    an increasing number of picket robots.'

  container-title: Journal of The Royal Society Interface
  publisher: The Royal Society
  page: '20170247'
  volume: '14'
  issue: '130'
  abstract: How fish modulate their fin stiffness during locomotive manoeuvres remains
    unknown. We show that changing the fin’s curvature modulates its stiffness. Modelling
    the fin as bendable bony rays held together by a membrane, we deduce that fin
    curvature is manifested as a misalignment of the principal bending axes between
    neighbouring rays. An external force causes neighbouring rays to bend and splay
    apart, and thus stretches the membrane. This coupling between bending the rays
    and stretching the membrane underlies the increase in stiffness. Using analysis
    of a 3D reconstruction of a Mackerel (Scomber japonicus) pectoral fin, we calculate
    the range of stiffnesses this fin is expected to span by changing curvature. The
    3D reconstruction shows that, even in its geometrically flat state, a functional
    curvature is embedded within the fin microstructure owing to the morphology of
    individual rays. Since the ability of a propulsive surface to transmit force to
    the surrounding fluid is limited by its stiffness, the fin curvature controls
    the coupling between the fish and its surrounding fluid. Thereby, our results
    provide mechanical underpinnings and morphological predictions for the hypothesis
    that the spanned range of fin stiffnesses correlates with the behaviour and the
    ecological niche of the fish.

  volume: '117'
  abstract: Abstract Isogeometric analysis (IGA) represents a recently developed technology
    in computational mechanics that offers the possibility of integrating methods
    for analysis and Computer Aided Design (CAD) into a single, unified process. The
    implications to practical engineering design scenarios are profound, since the
    time taken from design to analysis is greatly reduced, leading to dramatic gains
    in efficiency. In this manuscript, through a self-contained Matlab implementation,
    we present an introduction to IGA applied to simple analysis problems and the
    related computer implementation aspects. Furthermore, implementation of the extended
    IGA which incorporates enrichment functions through the partition of unity method
    (PUM) is also presented, where several examples for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional
    fracture are illustrated. We also describe the use of IGA in the context of strong-form
    (collocation) formulations, which has been an area of research interest due to
    the potential for significant efficiency gains offered by these methods. The code
    which accompanies the present paper can be applied to one, two and three-dimensional
    problems for linear elasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, structural
    mechanics (beams/plates/shells including large displacements and rotations) and
    Poisson problems with or without enrichment. The Bézier extraction concept that
    allows the FE analysis to be performed efficiently on T-spline geometries is also
    incorporated. The article includes a summary of recent trends and developments
    within the field of IGA.

  abstract: For 11 studies, we find that the detection of usability problems as a
    function of number of users tested or heuristic evaluators employed is well modeled
    as a Poisson process. The model can be used to plan the amount of evaluation required
    to achieve desired levels of thoroughness or benefits. Results of early tests
    can provide estimates of the number of problems left to be found and the number
    of additional evaluations needed to find a given fraction. With quantitative evaluation
    costs and detection values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations
    at which optimal cost/benefit ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility
    vanishes. For a “medium” example, we estimate that 16 evaluations would be worth
    their cost, with maximum benefit/cost ratio at four.

    points. Such characteristics make conventional types of control and robot design
    inadequate. Here we present an approach to realize motor control of jumping and
    landing which exploits the synergy between control and mechanical structure. Our
    experimental system is a pneumatically actuated bipedal robot called "Mowgli".
    Mowgli’s artificial musculoskeletal system consists of six McKibben pneumatic
    muscle actuators including bi-articular muscle and two legs with hip, knee, and
    ankle joints. Mowgli can reach jump heights of more than 50

  abstract: We propose soft planar actuators enhanced by free-form fabrication that
    are suitable for making everyday objects move. The actuator consists of one or
    more inflatable pouches with an adhesive back. We have developed a machine for
    the fabrication of free-from pouches; squares, circles and ribbons are all possible.
    The deformation of the pouches can provide linear, rotational, and more complicated
    motion corresponding to the pouch’s geometry. We also provide a both manual and
    programmable control system. In a user study, we organized a hands-on workshop
    of actuated origami for children. The results show that the combination of the
    actuator and classic materials can enhance rapid prototyping of animated objects.

  volume: '61'

  abstract: In this paper, we present locomotion learning for an Anguilliform robotic
    fish using a central pattern generator (CPG) approach. First, we give the overall
    structure of the CPG. Different from a traditional CPG that contains only coupled
    oscillators, our CPG consists of coupled Andronov-Hopf oscillators, an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and an outer amplitude modulator. Coupled oscillators, which
    possess a limit-cycle character, are used to generate inputs to excite the ANN.
    The ANN serves as a learning mechanism, from which we can obtain desired waveforms.
    By inputting different signals to the ANN, different desired locomotion patterns
    can be obtained. Outer amplitude modulator resizes the amplitudes of the ANN outputs
    according to task specifications. The CPG possess temporal scalability, spatial
    scalability, and phase-shift property; thus, we can obtain desired amplitudes,
    oscillation frequencies, and phase differences by tuning corresponding parameters.
    By extracting the swimming pattern from a real fish and using the CPG approach,
    we successfully generate a new swimming pattern and apply it to the robotic fish.
    The new pattern reserves the swimming characters of the real fish, and it is more
    suitable to be applied to the robotic fish. By using the new pattern, the robotic
    fish can perform both forward locomotion and backward locomotion, which are validated
    by experiments. 1982-2012 IEEE.

  volume: '289'
  abstract: 'Abstract This work describes an automatic method to anisotropically remesh
    an input bad quality mesh while preserving sharp features. We extend the method
    of Lévy and Bonneel (2012), based on the lifting of the input mesh in a 6D space
    (position and normal), and the optimization of a restricted Voronoï diagram in
    that space. The main advantage of this method is that it does not require any
    parameterization of the input geometry: the remeshing is performed globally, and
    triangles can overlap several input charts. We improve this work by modifying
    the objective function minimized in the optimization process, in order to take
    into account sharp features. This new formulation is a generalization of the work
    of Lévy and Liu (2010), which does not require any explicit tagging of the sharp
    features. We provide efficient formulas to compute the gradient of our objective
    function, thus allowing us to use a quasi-Newton solver (Liu and Nocedal, 1989)
    to perform the minimization.'

  abstract: In this paper, dynamic modeling of a one-wheel robot, which is subjected
    to nonholonomic constraints, was derived by using Kane’s method. By imposing the
    constraints in the dynamic equations leads to system order reduction. This method
    can be applied without using Lagrange multipliers. So the computation complexity
    is reduced. The motion of the one-wheel robot integrated with a gyroscope for
    stabilization and steering was described. Numerical simulations are presented
    to verify validity of the model in agreement with the Lagrange’s formulation found
    in early works by other researchers.

  abstract: Here, we demonstrate a simple method to systematically control the responsive

    bilayer with a high modulus contrast. The Janus hydrogel microstrips could be
    easily fabricated by a simple micromolding technique combined with an initiated
    chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) coating, providing high flexibility in controlling
    the physical and chemical properties of the microstrips. The fabricated Janus
    hydrogel microstrip is composed of a soft, pH-responsive polymer hydrogel layer
    laminated with a highly cross-linked, rigid thin film, generating a geometric
    anisotropy at a micron scale. The large difference in the elastic moduli between
    the two layers of the Janus microstrips leads to a self-bending behavior in response
    to the pH change. More specifically, the impact of the physical and chemical properties
    of the microstrip on the self-bending phenomena was systematically investigated
    by changing the thickness and composition of two lay...

    on large scale research into engineering student persistence. They firmly base
    their research on the study by Seymour and Hewitt. The authors are interested
    in the question how persistence, engagement and migration of engineering students
    compare to the expression of these factors by non engineering students. The study
    consists of two parts: the authors analysed data from the MIDFIELD data base that
    comprises record data for all undergraduate students at nine public universities
    in southeastern USA. They confronted the MIDFIELD data with data from the National
    Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). The second part of the study was based on
    the Academic Pathway Study (APS) and looks for the relationship between student
    experiences and decisions to pursue an engineering degree. The question of persistence
    1: Where do students go after matriculation? The figures for engineering are consistent
    with American national averages, as Seymour and Hewitt report. Ohland et al (2008)
    also provide comparison data for other disciplines, finding four-year persistence

  abstract: In this paper, we develop a design method of nonlinear profile of gear
    ratio to utilize a DC servo motor effectively for a jumping robot. Because the
    larger ground force yields the higher kinetic energy of the robot body, the optimal
    gear ratio is obtained by the maximization of the ground force from statics point
    of view. Moreover, the varying gear ratio during the jump motion is obtained through
    a simulation which connects statics-based optimization and robot dynamics. A non-circular
    gear is synthesized which realizes the obtained optimal varying gear ratio. The
    effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by simulations.

    fingers for stable grasping</span>
  container-title: Journal of Robotic Systems
  page: 223-234
  volume: '1'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: An appropriate arrangement of finger joints is very important since the
    stability of grasping an object greatly depends on that arrangement. Multijointed
    fingers can grasp an object with many points of contact each of which is pressed
    against the object as if wrapping up that object. The amount of the wrapped up
    area and the form of the finger when an object is grasped are therefore important
    factors for determining the stability of grasping. We propose the wrapping factor
    to be used for the evaluation of the stability of grasping by using these factors.
    We consider 28 models for the finger having three joints, and perform a simulation
    of their ability to grasp various shapes stably. Based on the simulation results,
    an appropriate arrangement of lengths between phalanges for a multijointed finger
    is presented.

  page: 126-133
  volume: '100'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Despite two recent anatomical studies to the contrary, the order Piciformes
    appears to be polyphyletic. The structure of the zygodactyl foot in the Galbulae
    is very distinct from that in the Pici, and no unique shared derived characters
    of the tarsometatarsus have been demonstrated for these two taxa. The supposedly
    three-headed origin of M. flexor hallucis longus shared by the Galbulae and Pici
    is doubtfully homologous between the two groups, leaving only the Type VI deep
    flexor tendons as defining the order Piciformes. This condition is probably a
    convergent similarity. Evidence is presented supporting a close relationship between
    the Galbulae and the suborder Coracii and between the Pici and the Passeriformes.
    There are fewer character conflicts with this hypothesis than with the hypothesis
    that the Piciformes are monophyletic. Problems concerning fossil taxa are also
    addressed.

    their hydrostatic skeletons and muscles to burrow in granular substrates. In this
    letter, we investigate the design of soft digging robots inspired by the bristled
    worm, (polychaetas). The behavior of soft structures in dry granular environments
    is complex and still not well understood. We describe the design and fabrication
    of a soft robot capable of locomotion in granular substrates and investigate actuation
    strategies for drag reduction inspired by the bristled worms biomechanical behaviors.
    The drag reduction experiments focus on an actuated soft leading segment. We implemented
    and studied two methods of actuation for the leading segment: periodic radial
    expansion and bi-directional bending, both of which we find to have an impact
    on the locomotion in granular substrates. Soft robots performing periodic radial
    expansion of the leading segments experienced the least overall drag force, while
    those with unactuated tips experienced the largest drag force, emphasizing the
    importance of controlling the tip stiffness to enable effective subsurface movement.
    Based on these results, we designed and tested a tethered, three-segment soft
    robot capable of digging through dry granular media.'

  abstract: A SYSTEM capable of converting chemical energy to mechanical energy could
    serve as an actuator or an ’artificial muscle’ in several applications. Here we
    describe a chemomechanical system of this sort based on a synthetic polymer gel.
    The gel network is anionic, and positively charged surfactant molecules can therefore
    bind to its surface, inducing local shrinkage by decreasing the difference in
    osmotic pressure between the gel interior and the solution outside. By using an
    electric field to direct surfactant binding selectively to one side of the gel,
    we can induce contraction and curvature of a strip of gel. Reversing the direction
    of the field causes contraction of the opposite side, and when the gel is suspended
    in solution from a ratchet mechanism, it can thereby be made to move with a worm-like
    motion at a velocity of up to 25 cm min-1.

  abstract: This article presents the approaches taken to integrate a novel anthropomorphic

    use everyday objects in an environment built for humans are presented. Starting
    from a design that resembles the human hand regarding size and movability of the
    mechatronical system, a low-level control system is shown providing reliable and
    stable controllers for single joint angles and torques, entire fingers and several
    coordinated fingers. Further on, the high-level control system connecting the
    low-level control system with the rest of the humanoid robot is presented. It
    provides grasp skills to the superior robot control system, coordinates movements
    of hand and arm and determines grasp patterns, depending on the object to grasp
    and the task to execute. Finally some preliminary results of the system, which
    is currently tested in simulations, will be presented.

    ABSTRACT This paper presents a design, simulation, and fabrication pipeline for
    making transforming inflatables with various mate-rials. We introduce a bending
    mechanism that creates multiple, programmable shape-changing behaviors with inextensible
    materials, including paper, plastics and fabrics. We developed a software tool
    that generates this bending mechanism for a given geometry, simulates its transformation,
    and exports the compound geometry as digital fabrication files. We show a range
    of fabrication methods from manual sealing to heat pressing with custom stencils
    and a custom heat-sealing head that can be mounted on usual 3-axis CNC machines
    to pre-cisely fabricate the designed transforming material. Finally, we present
    three applications to show how this technology could be used for designing interactive
    wearables, toys, and furniture.

  abstract: Advances in fabrication technologies are enabling the production of architected
    materials with unprecedented properties. Most such materials are characterized
    by a fixed geometry, but in the design of some materials it is possible to incorporate
    internal mechanisms capable of reconfiguring their spatial architecture, and in
    this way to enable tunable functionality. Inspired by the structural diversity
    and foldability of the prismatic geometries that can be constructed using the
    snapology origami technique, here we introduce a robust design strategy based
    on space-filling tessellations of polyhedra to create three-dimensional reconfigurable
    materials comprising a periodic assembly of rigid plates and elastic hinges. Guided
    by numerical analysis and physical prototypes, we systematically explore the mobility
    of the designed structures and identify a wide range of qualitatively different
    deformations and internal rearrangements. Given that the underlying principles
    are scale-independent, our strategy can be applied to the design of the next generation
    of reconfigurable structures and materials, ranging from metre-scale transformable
    architectures to nanometre-scale tunable photonic systems.

  page: 483-489
  issue: September 2011
  abstract: 'Functionally Graded Rapid Prototyping (FGRP) is a novel design approach
    and technological framework enabling the controlled spatial variation of material
    properties through continuous gradients in functional components. Such variations
    are traditionally achieved as discrete delineations in physical behavior by fabricating
    multiple parts comprised of different materials, and assembling them only after
    the fabrication process has been completed. Recent advances in Computational Topology
    Design (CTD) and Solid Free-Form Fabrication (SFF) are promoting the creation
    of building components with controlled micro-, and macro-architectural features.
    The FGRP approach combines a novel software environment with a mechanical output
    tool designed as a 3-D printer to allow computer control of material distribution
    within a monolithic structure. Inspired by the integration of material, structure
    and form found in natural systems, this biologically inspired design approach
    allows for physical prototyping of graduated properties in product and architectural
    design scales. FGRP introduces the potential to dynamically mix, grade and vary
    the ratios of different materials, resulting in continuous gradients, and structurally
    optimized designs with efficient use of materials, reductions in waste and production
    of highly customizable features. The paper presents the FGRP technology as part
    of an overall integrated design approach to functionally gradient design fabrication.
    Two work-in-progress explorations of FGRP implementation are presented: a robotic
    arm able to 3-D print concrete with controllable density and a 3-D printer for
    UV-curable polymers exploring variable elasticity. Research methods and processes
    devised for its development are presented and design applications demonstrated.
    Current technological limitations and future directions are discussed and their
    implications reviewed. ?? 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London.'

  volume: '236'
  abstract: As an emerging field, soft-bodied robots require profoundly different
    approaches to sensing and actuation compared to their rigid-bodied counterparts.
    Electro-mechanical design, fabrication, and operational challenges due to material
    elasticity significantly complicate embedded, modular and precise proprioceptive
    feedback. This work presents a novel curvature sensor module to address the unique
    soft robotic specifications. The proposed device utilizes a magnet and an electronic
    Hall effect sensing component to accurately measure curvatures on a soft-bodied
    bending segment on a flexible circuit board, ensuring contact-free sensing. We
    verify performance of sensor modules on static and dynamic bending deformations
    based on a single initial calibration step. To the best of our knowledge, the
    presented device is the first modular and integrated soft-bodied sensor design
    that is demonstrated to be accurate up to 7.5 Hz with a root mean square error
    of 0.023 cm-1between measured and actual curvature without filtering out the intrinsic

  abstract: '— Soft robotics carries with the promise of making robots as capable
    and adaptable as biological creatures, but this will not be possible without the
    ability to perform self-sensing and control with precision and repeatability.
    In this paper, we seek to address this need with the development of a new pneumatically-actuated
    soft bending actuation module with integrated curvature sensing. We designed and
    fabricated two different versions of this module: one with a commercially available
    resistive flex sensor and the other with a magnetic curvature sensor of our own
    design, and used an external motion capture system to calibrate and verify the
    validity of these two modules. In addition, we used an iterative sliding mode
    controller to drive the modules through step curvature references to demonstrate
    the controllability of the modules as well as compare the usability of the two
    sensors. We found that the magnetic sensor returned noisy but accurate data, while
    the flex sensor was inaccurate and subject to drift but did not exhibit notable
    noise. Experimental results show that this phenomenon of drift from the flex sensor
    causes active feedback control of the bending actuator to exhibit significant
    positioning errors. This work demonstrates that our soft bending actuator can
    be controlled with repeatability and precision, and that our magnetic curvature
    sensor represents an improvement for use in closed-loop control of soft robotic
    devices.'

    driven soft robotics and actuators will involve employing different scaffold geometries
    and cellular constructs to enable a controllable emergence for increased production
    of force. By using hydrogel scaffolds and muscle tissue, soft biological robotic
    actuators that are capable of motility have been successfully engineered with
    varying morphologies. Having the flexibility of altering geometry while ensuring
    tissue viability can enable advancing functional output from these machines through
    the implementation of new construction concepts and fabrication approaches. This
    study reports a forward engineering approach to computationally design the next
    generation of biological machines via direct numerical simulations. This was subsequently
    followed by fabrication and characterization of high force producing biological
    machines. These biological machines show millinewton forces capable of driving
    locomotion at speeds above 0.5 mm s−1. It is important to note that these results
    are predicted by computational simulations, ultimately showing excellent agreement
    of the predictive models and experimental results, further providing the ability
    to forward design future generations of these biological machines. This study
    aims to develop the building blocks and modular technologies capable of scaling
    force and complexity of these devices for applications toward solving real world
    problems in medicine, environment, and manufacturing.

  abstract: This paper presents a low-profile bidirectional folding actuator based
    on annealed shape memory alloy sheets applicable for meso-and microscale systems.
    Despite the advantages of shape memory alloys - high strain, silent operation,
    and mechanical simplicity - their application is often limited to unidirectional
    operation. We present a bidirectional folding actuator that produces two opposing
    180°motions. A laser-patterned nickel alloy (Inconel 600) heater localizes actuation
    to the folding sections. The actuator has a thin (\<1mm) profile, making it appropriate
    for use in robotic origami. Various design parameters and fabrication variants
    are described and experimentally explored in the actuator prototype. 2012 IOP

  volume: '1726'
  abstract: One of the main challenges in the development of microrobots, i.e. robots
    at the sub-millimeter scale, is the difficulty of adopting traditional solutions
    for power, control and, especially, actuation. As a result, most current microrobots
    are directly manipulated by external fields, and possess only a few passive degrees
    of freedom (DOFs). We have reported a strategy that enables embodiment, remote
    powering and control of a large number of DOFs in mobile soft microrobots. These
    consist of photo-responsive materials, such that the actuation of their soft continuous
    body can be selectively and dynamically controlled by structured light fields.
    Here we use finite-element modelling to evaluate the effective number of DOFs
    that are addressable in our microrobots. We also demonstrate that by this flexible
    approach different actuation patterns can be obtained, and thus different locomotion
    performances can be achieved within the very same microrobot. The reported results
    confirm the versatility of the proposed approach, which allows for easy application-specific
    optimization and online reconfiguration of the microrobot’s behavior. Such versatility
    will enable advanced applications of robotics and automation at the micro scale.

  page: 647-653
  volume: '15'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: Microorganisms move in challenging environments by periodic changes in
    body shape. In contrast, current artificial microrobots cannot actively deform,
    exhibiting at best passive bending under external fields. Here, by taking advantage
    of the wireless, scalable and spatiotemporally selective capabilities that light
    allows, we show that soft microrobots consisting of photoactive liquid-crystal
    elastomers can be driven by structured monochromatic light to perform sophisticated
    biomimetic motions. We realize continuum yet selectively addressable artificial
    microswimmers that generate travelling-wave motions to self-propel without external
    forces or torques, as well as microrobots capable of versatile locomotion behaviours
    on demand. Both theoretical predictions and experimental results confirm that
    multiple gaits, mimicking either symplectic or antiplectic metachrony of ciliate
    protozoa, can be achieved with single microswimmers. The principle of using structured
    light can be extended to other applications that require microscale actuation
    with sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination for advanced microrobotic technologies.

    a 3D unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis tool has been adapted

  abstract: The finite element method has often been used to simulate excavation.
    When the soll is linearly elastic, the results of excavation should be independent
    of the number of stages in the excavation process, and lack of such independence
    indicates an incorrect procedure. The simple direct method described in this paper
    provides the required independence In the case of linearly elastic materials,
    and hence can be used for multl-stage excavation in non-linear problems without
    excessive errors. However methods whose errors increase with the number of stages
    of excavation are quite unsuitable for non-llnear problems. Alternative methods
    of analysis, errors arising from the inability of the elements to model adequately
    the stress gradients near the toe of the excavation and excavation adjacent to
    a diaphragm wall are discussed.

  abstract: We consider the dynamic snapping instability of elastic beams and shells.
    Using the Kirchhoff rod and Föppl-von Kármán plate equations, we study the stability,
    deformation modes, and snap-through dynamics of an elastic arch with clamped boundaries
    and subject to a concentrated load. For parameters typical of everyday and technological
    applications of snapping, we show that the stretchability of the arch plays a
    critical role in determining not only the post-buckling mode of deformation but
    also the timescale of snapping and the frequency of the arch’s vibrations about
    its final equilibrium state. We show that the growth rate of the snap-through
    instability and its subsequent ringing frequency can both be interpreted physically
    as the result of a sound wave in the material propagating over a distance comparable
    to the length of the arch. Finally, we extend our analysis of the ringing frequency
    of indented arches to understand the “pop” heard when everted shell structures
    snap-through to their stable state. Remarkably, we find that not only are the
    scaling laws for the ringing frequencies in these two scenarios identical but
    also the respective prefactors are numerically close; this allows us to develop
    a master curve for the frequency of ringing in snapping beams and shells.

  container-title: Smart Health
  page: 34-49
  volume: 1-2
  abstract: Abstract The world is experiencing an unprecedented, enduring, and pervasive
    aging process. With more people who need walking assistance, the demand for gait
    rehabilitation has increased rapidly over the years. Effective gait rehabilitation
    requires a comprehensive gait analysis, in which gait phase detection plays an
    important role. Although many specialized sensing systems have been developed
    for gait monitoring, most existing gait phase detection algorithms rely on significant
    input from medical professionals, which are subjective, manual and inaccurate.
    To address these problems, this paper presents a data-driven approach for real-time
    gait phase detection. The approach combines an infinite Gaussian mixture model
    (IGMM) to classify different gait phases based on the ground contact force (GCF)
    measurement, and a parallel particle filter to estimate and update the model parameters.
    Effective particle sharing mechanisms are further designed to distribute particles
    among different working nodes judiciously and thus strike a good balance between
    computational overhead and estimation accuracy. The proposed algorithm is implemented
    in our gait monitoring and analysis platform developed on a VMware cluster. Its
    estimation accuracy and computational efficiency are examined through extensive
    experiments using the data traces collected from both healthy human subjects and
    patients with neurological disorders.

  abstract: This paper introduces a bounding gait control algorithm that allows a
    variable-speed running in the MIT Cheetah 2. A simple impulse planning algorithm
    is proposed to design vertical and horizontal force profiles which make net impulse
    on the system during one cycle zero. This design of force profiles leads to the
    conservation of linear momentum over a complete step, providing periodicity in
    horizontal and vertical velocity. When designed profiles are applied to the system,
    periodic orbits with an ability to change running speed are obtained. A virtual
    compliance control in the horizontal and vertical direction has been added onto
    the designed force profiles to stabilize the periodic orbits. The experimental
    results show that the algorithm successfully achieved untethered 3D running of
    the MIT Cheetah 2, with speeds ranging from 0 m/sec to 4.5 m/sec on treadmills
    as well as on grassy fields.

  abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a bounding controller
    for the MIT Cheetah 2 and its experimental results. The paper introduces the architecture
    of the controller along with the functional roles of its subcomponents. The application
    of impulse scaling provides feedforward force profiles that automatically adapt
    across a wide range of speeds. A discrete gait pattern stabilizer maintains the
    footfall sequence and timing. Continuous feedback is layered to manage balance
    during the stance phase. Stable hybrid limit cycles are exhibited in simulation
    using simplified models, and are further validated in untethered three-dimensional
    bounding experiments. Experiments are conducted both indoors and outdoors on various
    man-made and natural terrains. The control framework is shown to provide stable
    bounding in the hardware, at speeds of up to 6.4 m/s and with a minimum total
    cost of transport of 0.47. These results are unprecedented accomplishments in
    terms of efficiency and speed in untethered experimental quadruped machines.

  abstract: 'The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) humanoid
    robot-1 (KHR-1) was developed for the purpose of researching the walking action
    of bipeds. KHR-1, which has no hands or head, has 21 d.o.f.: 12 d.o.f. in the
    legs, 1 d.o.f. in the torso and 8 d.o.f. in the arms. The second version of this
    humanoid robot, KHR-2 (which has 41 d.o.f.) can walk on a living-room floor; it
    also moves and looks like a human. The third version, KHR-3 (HUBO), has more human-like
    features, a greater variety of movements and a more human-friendly character.
    We present the mechanical design of HUBO, including the design concept, the lower-body
    design, the upper-body design and the actuator selection of joints. Previously
    we developed and published details of KHR-1 and KHR-2. The HUBO platform, which
    is based on KHR-2, has 41 d.o.f., stands 125 cm tall and weighs 55 kg. From a
    mechanical point of view, HUBO has greater mechanical stiffness and a more detailed
    frame design than KHR-2. The stiffness of the frame was increased, and the detailed
    design around the joints and link frame was either modified or fully redesigned.
    We initially introduced an exterior art design concept for KHR-2 and that concept
    was implemented in HUBO at the mechanical design stage. 2007 VSP.'

  abstract: This paper proposes a control method for biped robot locomotion based
    on impedance control and impedance modulation. Both legs are controlled by the
    impedance control, where the desired impedance at the hip and the swing foot are
    specified. The impedance parameters are changed depending on the gait phase of
    the biped robot. To reduce the magnitude of impact and to guarantee a stable footing
    at foot landings on the ground, the damping coefficient of the impedance of the
    landing foot is increased drastically and the reference trajectory of the landing
    foot is reset at its initial contact with the ground. A series of computer simulations
    of a 12-degree-of-freedom (DOF) biped robot with a 6-DOF environment model which
    consists of nonlinear and linear compliant spring-and-dampers, shows that the
    proposed control method works well and is superior to position-oriented control
    methods such as the computed-torque control method in impact regulation during
    foot landings and adaptation to some ground irregularity

    Releaser Subsumption Architecture. This CRSA has the releasers which connect upper
    level with lower level. In order to verify the effectiveness of the CRSA, a 4
    degree-of-freedom hand was designed and several behavioral grasping simulations
    and experiments are performed. In the simulations, the graphical behavioral performance
    was obtained as well as the trajectories of each of the fingers. In the experiments,
    some of the behaviors were initiated at level 1 to level 2. While the robotic
    hand performed grasping behaviors, the control program took the data from the
    DC motors and FSR sensors to make plan for future behaviors. The experiment results
    show that it is possible to control a robotic hand by behavior-based tactile servoing
    strategies.

  abstract: We have developed methods for creating microscale inorganic light-emitting
    diodes (LEDs) and for assembling and interconnecting them into unusual display
    and lighting systems. The LEDs use specialized epitaxial semiconductor layers
    that allow delineation and release of large collections of ultrathin devices.
    Diverse shapes are possible, with dimensions from micrometers to millimeters,
    in either flat or "wavy" configurations. Printing-based assembly methods can deposit
    these devices on substrates of glass, plastic, or rubber, in arbitrary spatial
    layouts and over areas that can be much larger than those of the growth wafer.
    The thin geometries of these LEDs enable them to be interconnected by conventional
    planar processing techniques. Displays, lighting elements, and related systems
    formed in this manner can offer interesting mechanical and optical properties.

  page: 4805-4810
  abstract: We present the design of a soft wearable robotic device composed of elastomeric
    artificial muscle actuators and soft fabric sleeves, for active assistance of
    knee motions. A key feature of the device is the two-dimensional design of the
    elastomer muscles that not only allows the compactness of the device, but also
    significantly simplifies the manufacturing process. In addition, the fabric sleeves
    make the device lightweight and easily wearable. The elastomer muscles were characterized
    and demonstrated an initial contraction force of 38N and maximum contraction of
    18mm with 104kPa input pressure, approximately. Four elastomer muscles were employed
    for assisted knee extension and flexion. The robotic device was tested on a 3D
    printed leg model with an articulated knee joint. Experiments were conducted to
    examine the relation between systematic change in air pressure and knee extension-flexion.
    The results showed maximum extension and flexion angles of 95° and 37°, respectively.
    However, these angles are highly dependent on underlying leg mechanics and positions.
    The device was also able to generate maximum extension and flexion forces of 3.5N
    and 7N, respectively.

  container-title: Analytica Chimica Acta
  publisher: Elsevier Ltd
  page: 57-66
  volume: '1027'
  abstract: Given the increased interest in public hygiene due to outbreaks of food
    poisoning, increased emphasis has been placed on developing novel monitoring systems
    for point-of-care testing (POCT) to evaluate pathogens causing foodborne illnesses.
    Here, we demonstrate a pathogen evaluation system utilizing simple film-based
    microfluidics, featuring simultaneous gene amplification, solution mixing, and
    electrochemical detection. To minimize and integrate the various functionalities
    into a single chip, patterned polyimide and polyester films were mainly used on
    a polycarbonate housing chip, allowing simple fabrication and alignment, in contrast
    to conventional polymerase chain reaction, which requires a complex biosensing
    system at a bench-top scale. The individual integrated sensing chip could be manually
    fabricated in 10 min. Using the developed film-based integrated biosensing chip,
    the genes from the pathogens causing foodborne illnesses were simultaneously amplified
    based on multiple designed microfluidic chambers and Hoechst 33258, which intercalates
    into double-stranded DNA, to generate the electrochemical signal. The target pathogen
    gene was accurately analyzed by square wave voltammetry (SWV) within the 25 s,
    while the gel electrophoresis required about 30 min. Based on the developed integrated
    biosensing chip, the 1.0 × 101 and 1.0 × 102 colony-forming unit (CFU) of Staphylococcus
    aureus and Escherichia coli were sensitively detected with high reproducibility
    in the 25 s. On the basis of the significant features of the film-based molecular
    analysis platform, we expect that the developed sensor could be applied to the
    screening of various pathogens as a POCT device.

  abstract: A theoretical model of avian flight is developed which simulates wing
    motion through a class of methods known as predictive simulation. This approach
    uses numerical optimization to predict power-optimal kinematics of avian wings
    in hover, cruise, climb and descent. The wing dynamics capture both aerodynamic
    and inertial loads. The model is used to simulate the flight of the pigeon, Columba
    livia, and the results are compared with previous experimental measurements. In
    cruise, the model unearths a vast range of kinematic modes that are capable of
    generating the required forces for flight. The most efficient mode uses a near-vertical
    stroke-plane and a flexed-wing upstroke, similar to kinematics recorded experimentally.
    In hover, the model predicts that the power-optimal mode uses an extended-wing
    upstroke, similar to hummingbirds. In flexing their wings, pigeons are predicted
    to consume 20

  container-title: The Journal of experimental biology
  page: 1413-23
  volume: '210'
  issue: Pt 8
  abstract: Flying squirrels are well known for their ability to glide between trees
    at the top of a forest canopy. We present experimental performance and behavioural
    evidence that flight in flying squirrels may have evolved out of a need to control
    landing forces. Northern flying squirrels were filmed jumping from a horizontal
    branch to a much larger vertical pole. These were both slightly compliant (less
    than 1.9 mm N(-1)), and instrumented using strain gauges so that forces could
    be measured. Take-off and landing forces were both positively correlated with
    horizontal range between 0.5 and 2.5 m (r=0.355 and r=0.811, respectively, P\<0.05),
    but not significantly different to each other at each range tested. Take-off forces
    ranged from 1 to 10 bodyweights, and landing forces were between 3 and 10 bodyweights.
    Glide angles increased rapidly with horizontal range, approaching 45 degrees at
    3 m, above which they gradually decreased, suggesting that northern flying squirrels
    are optimised for long distance travel. We show that northern flying squirrels
    initiate full gliding posture at ranges of less than 1 m, without landing any
    higher than an equivalent ballistic projectile. However, this gliding posture
    enables them to pitch upwards, potentially stalling the wing, and spreads the
    landing reaction force over all four extended limbs. At steeper approach angles
    of close to 45 degrees , flying squirrels were unable to pitch up sufficiently
    and landed forelimbs first, consequently sustaining higher impact forces. We investigate
    four hypotheses to explain the origin of flight in these animals and conclude
    that the need to reduce landing impact forces was most likely to have stimulated
    the development of aerial control in flying squirrels.

  abstract: Advances in digital design and fabrication technologies are leading toward
    single fabrication systems capable of producing almost any complete functional
    object. We are proposing a new paradigm for manufacturing, which we call Universal
    Desktop Fabrication (UDF), and a framework for its development. UDF will be a
    coherent system of volumetric digital design software able to handle infinite
    complexity at any spatial resolution and compact, automated, multi-material digital
    fabrication hardware. This system aims to be inexpensive, simple, safe and intuitive
    to operate, open to user modification and experimentation, and capable of rapidly
    manufacturing almost any arbitrary, complete, high-quality, functional object.
    Through the broad accessibility and generality of digital technology, UDF will
    enable vastly more individuals to become innovators of technology, and will catalyze
    a shift from specialized mass production and global transportation of products
    to personal customization and point-of-use manufacturing. Likewise, the inherent
    accuracy and speed of digital computation will allow processes that significantly
    surpass the practical complexity of the current design and manufacturing systems.
    This transformation of manufacturing will allow for entirely new classes of human-made,
    peer-produced, micro-engineered objects, resulting in more dynamic and natural
    interactions with the world. We describe and illustrate our current results in
    UDF hardware and software, and describe future development directions.

  abstract: Since the late 50’s hydraulics have been the systems of choice where high
    force-to-weight ratios are required. Today hydraulic excavators are widely used
    in construction, mining, excavation, and forestry applications. The skilled operator
    also cannot know about the terrain condition, soil parameters, and the soil-tool
    interaction forces exerted during excavation operation are required to find because
    these forces helpful for better design of the tool, backhoe parts and for trajectory
    planning. This paper focuses on the review of a work carried out by researchers
    in the same field which includes the fundamental of soil mechanics, soil tool
    interaction forces and various parameters affect on the soil-tool interaction
    during its actual digging action. This area is open to carry out further research
    to know the effect of various parameters on soil-tool interaction, prediction
    of digging trajectory and excavation forces and for robust design of backhoe mechanism.

  volume: '10303'
  abstract: Solid modeling of objects forms an important task in design and manufacturing.
    Recent developments in the field of layered manufacturing have shown potential
    for the physical realization of heterogeneous (multi-material) objects. Thus,
    there is a need to represent material information as an integral part of the CAD
    model data. Information models for the representation of product data are being
    developed as an international standard informally called STEP (ISO 10303). However,
    the current application pro- tocols focus on the representation of homogeneous
    objects only. This paper proposes an information model to represent heteroge-
    neous objects using the information modeling methodology de- veloped for ISO 10303.
    This will help in providing a uniform base in the development of heterogeneous
    solid modeling sys- tems. It will also equip the solid modeler with the ability
    to inte- grate with other applications and process planning in the domain of layered
    manufacturing.

  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Robotics
  page: 944-957
  volume: '22'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: 'The static properties of tensegrity structures have been widely appreciated
    in civil engineering as the basis of extremely lightweight yet strong mechanical
    structures. However, the dynamic properties and their potential utility in the
    design of robots have been relatively unexplored. This paper introduces robots
    based on tensegrity structures, which demonstrate that the dynamics of such structures
    can be utilized for locomotion. Two tensegrity robots are presented: TR3, based
    on a triangular tensegrity prism with three struts, and TR4, based on a quadrilateral
    tensegrity prism with four struts. For each of these robots, simulation models
    are designed, and automatic design of controllers for forward locomotion are performed
    in simulation using evolutionary algorithms. The evolved controllers are shown
    to be able to produce static and dynamic gaits in both robots. A real-world tensegrity
    robot is then developed based on one of the simulation models as a proof of concept.
    The results demonstrate that tensegrity structures can provide the basis for lightweight,
    strong, and fault-tolerant robots with a potential for a variety of locomotor
    gaits'

  abstract: We report our initial progress on synthesizing complex structures from
    programmable self-folding active materials, which we call Smart Multi-Use Reconfigurable
    Forms. We have developed a method to unfold a given convex polygonal mesh into
    a one-piece planar surface. We analyze the behavior of this surface as if it were
    constructed from realistic active materials such as shape memory alloys (SMAs),
    in which sharp creases and folds are not feasible. These active materials can
    change their shapes when they are heated and have been applied to medical, aerospace,
    and automotive applications in the engineering realm. We demonstrate via material
    constitutive modeling and utilization of finite element analysis (FEA) that by
    appropriately heating the unfolded planar surface it is possible to recover the
    3D shape of the original polygonal mesh. We have simulated the process and our
    finite element analysis simulations demonstrate that these active materials can
    be raised against gravity, formed, and reconfigured automatically in three dimensions
    with appropriate heating in a manner that extends previous work in the area of
    programmable matter. Based on our results, we believe that it is possible to use
    active materials to develop reprogrammable self-folding complex structures. ??

  abstract: Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has inspired the design of
    engineering devices ands̊tructures for decades. The underlying principles of origami
    are very general, which has led toåpplications ranging from cardboard containers
    to deployable space structures. More recently,r̊esearchers have become interested
    in the use of active materials (i.e., those that convert variousf̊orms of energy
    into mechanical work) to effect the desired folding behavior. When used in as̊uitable
    geometry, active materials allow engineers to create self-folding structures.
    Suchs̊tructures are capable of performing folding and/or unfolding operations
    without being kinematicallym̊anipulated by external forces or moments. This is
    advantageous for many applications includings̊pace systems, underwater robotics,
    small scale devices, and self-assembling systems. This articlei̊s a survey and
    analysis of prior work on active self-folding structures as well as methods andt̊ools
    available for the design of folding structures in general and self-folding structures
    inp̊articular. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic
    view of thes̊tate-of-the-art in this important and evolving area. Unifying structural
    principles for actives̊elf-folding structures are identified and used as a basis
    for a quantitative and qualitativec̊omparison of numerous classes of active materials.
    Design considerations specific to foldeds̊tructures are examined, including the
    issues of crease pattern identification and fold kinematics.Ålthough few tools
    have been created with active materials in mind, many of them are useful in theo̊verall
    design process for active self-folding structures. Finally, the article concludes
    with ad̊iscussion of open questions for the field of origami-inspired engineering.

  page: 59-83
  abstract: The mechanical properties of our limbs and how those properties are regulated
    by the nervous system endow us with the ability to interact with our environment
    in numerous predictable and effective ways. While there have been many recent
    advances in the design and control of prosthetic limbs, none yet have the capacity
    to regulate their mechanical impedance over the range achievable by human limbs,
    or to replicate the functions that neuromuscular impedance control makes possible.
    The premise of this chapter is that designing prosthetic limbs capa- ble of replicating
    the essential functions endowed by impedance controlwould lead to more natural
    and capable devices. The chapter summarizes current understanding of howhuman
    limb impedance is regulated, and attempts at replicating the functions afforded
    by impedance control in prosthetic limbs. It also highlights challenges and possible
    solutions in each of these areas.

  container-title: Bioinspiration and Biomimetics
  volume: '6'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: DASH+Wings is a small hexapedal winged robot that uses flapping wings
    to increase its locomotion capabilities. To examine the effects of flapping wings,
    multiple experimental controls for the same locomotor platform are provided by
    wing removal, by the use of inertially similar lateral spars, and by passive rather
    than actively flapping wings. We used accelerometers and high-speed cameras to
    measure the performance of this hybrid robot in both horizontal running and while
    ascending inclines. To examine consequences of wing flapping for aerial performance,
    we measured lift and drag forces on the robot at constant airspeeds and body orientations
    in a wind tunnel; we also determined equilibrium glide performance in free flight.
    The addition of flapping wings increased the maximum horizontal running speed
    from 0.68 to 1.29 m s⁻¹, and also increased the maximum incline angle of ascent
    from 5.6° to 16.9°. Free flight measurements show a decrease of 10.3° in equilibrium
    glide slope between the flapping and gliding robot. In air, flapping improved
    the mean lift:drag ratio of the robot compared to gliding at all measured body
    orientations and airspeeds. Low-amplitude wing flapping thus provides advantages
    in both cursorial and aerial locomotion. We note that current support for the
    diverse theories of avian flight origins derive from limited fossil evidence,
    the adult behavior of extant flying birds, and developmental stages of already
    volant taxa. By contrast, addition of wings to a cursorial robot allows direct
    evaluation of the consequences of wing flapping for locomotor performance in both
    running and flying.

  page: 5080-5086
  abstract: BOLT is a lightweight bipedal ornithopter capable of high-speed dynamic
    running and effecting transitions between aerial and terrestrial locomotion modes.
    The gait dynamics of both quasi-static and dynamic locomotion are examined through
    the use of an on-board accelerometer, part of a one gram electronics package also
    containing a processor and radio. We discuss the accelerations in the context
    of the traditional spring-loaded inverted pendulum model seen in nearly all legged
    locomotion in organisms. Flapping wings are shown to provide damping along with
    propulsive force. The aerodynamic forces of the flapping wings also impart passive
    stability to the robot, enabling it to run bipedally with only a single actuator.
    BOLT transitions from ground running to aerial hovering in as little as one meter
    of runway. Overall, the advantages provided by wings in terrestrial locomotion,
    coupled with aerial capabilities, allow BOLT to navigate complex three dimensional
    environments, switching between locomotion modes when necessary.

  abstract: 'We consider the problem of autonomously estimating position and orientation
    of an object from tactile data. When initial uncertainty is high, estimation of
    all six parameters precisely is computationally expensive. We propose an efficient
    Bayesian approach that is able to estimate all six parameters in both unimodal
    and multimodal scenarios. The approach is termed scaling series sampling as it
    estimates the solution region by samples. It performs the search using a series
    of successive refinements, gradually scaling the precision from low to high. Our
    approach can be applied to a wide range of manipulation tasks. We demonstrate
    its portability on two applications: (1) manipulating a box and (2) grasping a
    door handle.'

    Manipulation Skills</span>
  publisher: University of Massachusetts Amherst
  genre: PhD thesis
  abstract: One of the main challenges in the field of robotics is to build machines
    that can function intelligently in unstructured environments. Because of this,
    the field has witnessed a trend away from the sense-plan-act paradigm where the
    robot makes an attempt to model everything before planning and acting. Nevertheless,
    few approaches to robotic grasping and manipulation have been proposed that do
    not require detailed geometric models of the manipulation environment. One exception
    is the control-based approach where closed-loop controllers reactively generate
    grasping and manipulation behavior. This thesis develops and extends the control-based
    approach to grasping and manipulation and proposes a new framework for learning
    control-based skills based on generalized solutions.This thesis extends control-based
    approaches to grasping and manipulation in several ways. First, several new controllers
    relevant to reaching and grasping are proposed, including a grasp controller that
    slides contacts over the surface of an object toward good grasp configurations
    by using haptic feedback. The number of different grasps that can be generated
    using grasp controllers is expanded through the use of virtual contacts. In addition,
    a new approach to statically-stable dexterous manipulation is proposed whereby
    the robot navigates through a space of statically stable grasp configurations
    by executing closed-loop controllers. In a series of experiments, grasp controllers
    are shown to be a practical approach to synthesizing different grasps from a variety
    of different starting configurations.This thesis also proposes a new approach
    to learning control-based behaviors by applying a generalized solution in new
    situations. Instead of searching the entire space of all controller sequences
    and combinations, only variations of a generalized solution, encoded by an action
    schema, are considered. A new algorithm, known as schema structured learning,
    is proposed that learns how to apply the generalized solution in different problem
    contexts through a process of trial and error. This approach is applied to the
    grasp synthesis problem, enabling a robot to learn grasp skills with relatively
    little training experience. The algorithm learns to select an appropriate reach-grasp
    strategy based on coarse visual context. In an experiment where a dexterous humanoid
    robot grasps a range of grocery items it had no prior experience with, the learned
    grasp skills are shown to generalize well to new objects and object configurations

  abstract: Much of the tradition in robot grasping is rooted in geometrical, planning-based
    approaches in which it is assumed that object geometries are well modeled a priori.
    Some recent approaches have chosen instead to deal with objects of unknown geometry.
    These techniques treat grasping as an active sensory-driven problem. At any given
    time, finger contacts are incrementally displaced along the object’s local surface
    using a single control law. In this paper, we extend this approach by allowing
    multiple control laws to be active simultaneously. Three control laws are combined
    by projecting the actions of subordinate control laws into other control law spaces.
    The resulting composite controller finds grasps that are more robust than the
    component primitives in isolation. Finally, we show how this approach may be used
    on hand/arm manipulation systems with arbitrary kinematics.

  abstract: Control-based approaches to grasp synthesis create grasping behavior by
    sequencing and combining control primitives. In the absence of any other structure,
    these approaches must evaluate a large number of feasible control sequences as
    a function of object shape, object pose, and task. This paper explores a new approach
    to grasp synthesis that limits consideration to variations on a generalized localize-reach-grasp
    control policy. A new learning algorithm, known as schema structured learning,
    is used to learn which instantiations of the generalized policy are most likely
    to lead to a successful grasp in different problem contexts. Experiments are described
    where Dexter, a dexterous bimanual humanoid, learns to select appropriate grasp
    strategies for different objects as a function of object eccentricity and orientation.
    In addition, it is shown that grasp skills learned in this way generalize well
    to new objects. Results are presented showing that after learning how to grasp
    a small, representative set of objects, the robot’s performance quantitatively
    improves for similar objects that it has not experienced before.

  abstract: '2017 by ASME.The leg mechanism of the novel jumping robot, Salto, is
    designed to achieve multiple functions during the sub-200 ms time span that the
    leg interacts with the ground, including minimizing impulse loading, balancing
    angular momentum, and manipulating power output of the robot’s series-elastic
    actuator. This is all accomplished passively with a single degree-of-freedom linkage
    that has a coupled, unintuitive design which was synthesized using the technique
    described in this paper. Power delivered through the mechanism is increased beyond
    the motor’s limit by using variable mechanical advantage to modulate energy storage
    and release in a series-elastic actuator. This power modulating behavior may enable
    high amplitude, high frequency jumps. We aim to achieve all required behaviors
    with a linkage composed only of revolute joints, simplifying the robot’s hardware
    but necessitating a complex design procedure since there are no pre-existing solutions.
    The synthesis procedure has two phases: (1) design exploration to initially compile
    linkage candidates, and (2) kinematic tuning to incorporate power modulating characteristics
    and ensure an impulse-limited, rotation-free jump motion. The final design is
    an eight-bar linkage with a stroke greater than half the robot’s total height
    that produces a simulated maximum jump power 3.6 times greater than its motor’s
    limit. A 0.27m tall prototype is shown to exhibit minimal pitch rotations during
    meter high test jumps.'

  abstract: This paper identifies the class of actuators called clutched elastic actuators
    (CEAs). CEAs use clutches to control the energy flow into springs. CEAs in exoskeletons,
    prostheses, legged robots, and robotic arms have shown the ability to reduce the
    energy consumption and motor requirements, such as peak torque and peak power.
    Because of those abilities, they are increasingly used in robotics. In this paper,
    we categorize existing CEA designs, identify trends in those designs, and provide
    a method to analyze their functionality. Based on a literature survey, current
    CEA designs are placed in nine categories, depending on their morphology. The
    main trend is that CEA designs are becoming more complex, meaning that the number
    of clutches and springs increases. We show with the introduced mathematical analysis
    that the functionality can be analyzed with a constraint matrix, a stiffness matrix,
    and multiplication of a clutch-dependent diagonal matrix with an oriented incidence
    matrix. This method eases the analysis of the functionality of CEAs. Furthermore,
    it can lead to new CEA designs in which the number of resulting stiffnesses grows
    exponentially with the number of springs and clutches.

  abstract: This paper presents advancements in the design of a portable, soft robotic
    glove for individuals with functional grasp pathologies. The robotic glove leverages
    soft material actuator technology to safely distribute forces along the length
    of the finger and provide active flexion and passive extension. These actuators
    consist of molded elastomeric bladders with anisotropic fiber reinforcements that
    produce specific bending, twisting, and extending trajectories upon fluid pressurization.
    In particular, we present a method for customizing a soft actuator to a wearer’s
    biomechanics and demonstrate in a motion capture system that the ranges of motion
    (ROM) of the two are nearly equivalent. The active ROM of the glove is further
    evaluated using the Kapandji test. Lastly, in a case study, we present preliminary
    results of a patient with very weak hand strength performing a timed Box-and-Block
    test with and without the soft robotic glove.

  abstract: Soft fluidic actuators consisting of elastomeric matrices with embedded
    flexible materials are of particular interest to the robotics community because
    they are affordable and can be easily customized to a given application. However,
    the significant potential of such actuators is currently limited as their design
    has typically been based on intuition. In this paper, the principle of operation
    of these actuators is comprehensively analyzed and described through experimentally
    validated quasi-static analytical and finite-element method models for bending
    in free space and force generation when in contact with an object. This study
    provides a set of systematic design rules to help the robotics community create
    soft actuators by understanding how these vary their outputs as a function of
    input pressure for a number of geometrical parameters. Additionally, the proposed
    analytical model is implemented in a controller demonstrating its ability to convert
    pressure information to bending angle in real time. Such an understanding of soft
    multimaterial actuators will allow future design concepts to be rapidly iterated
    and their performance predicted, thus enabling new and innovative applications
    that produce more complex motions to be explored

  volume: '179'
  abstract: Robotic applications often require robust tactile sensing capabilities
    on curved surfaces, such as artificial fingertips. Flexible tactile sensors could
    be conformally wrapped around curved digits and could enhance grip by cushioning
    impacts and increasing the effective contact area during grasp. Flexible microfabricated
    devices that use thin film or solid electrical components are susceptible to failure
    due to cracking and fatigue. Conductive fluids have been used as transduction
    media, electrical connections, and in resistance-based pressure and bend sensors.
    In this work, a flexible and multilayer capacitive microfluidic normal force sensor
    is developed with a 5 × 5 taxel array. The sensor uses liquid metal-filled microfluidic
    channels as the capacitive plates and conductive interconnects. The sensor is
    microfabricated using soft lithography microfabrication techniques and consists
    of multiple layers of PDMS microchannels filled with the liquid metal alloy Galinstan
    and air pockets that modify the mechanical and electrical properties of the sensor.
    A single taxel is calibrated for normal forces ranging from 0 to 2.5 N, is shown
    to provide repeatable measurements of static uniaxial loads, and follows the loading
    and unloading phases of low-frequency dynamic loads (0.4-4 Hz). The sensor prototype
    has a spatial resolution on the order of 0.5 mm, performs reliably when wrapped
    around a surface having a curvature similar to that of a human finger (1.575 cm-1),
    and has been shown to tolerate curvatures as high as 6.289 cm-1. The deformable
    liquid capacitive plates and heterogeneous PDMS-air dielectric medium can be designed
    to tune the sensor’s sensitivity and range. The sensor prototype provides greater
    sensitivity at low loads, a feature which can be exploited for robotic applications
    in which light touch is important. 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  abstract: 'Conventional three-dimensional printing processes are material-dependent,
    and are irreversible. We present an alternative approach based on three-dimensional
    assembly of mass-produced two-dimensional components of digital material. This
    significantly enlarges the available material set, allows reversible disassembly,
    and imposes constraints that reduce the accumulation of local positioning errors
    in constructing a global shape. Experimental work on material properties and dimensional
    scaling of the digital material will be presented, with application in assembling
    functional structures. We propose that assembling digital material will be the
    future of 3 -dimensional free-form fabrication of functional materials. Most existing
    commercial free-form fabrication printers build by putting together small quantities
    of no more than a few expensive materials. In order to make high-resolution objects
    they need to be very precise and therefore cost between tens and hundreds of thousands
    of dollars and are operated by skilled technicians. On the other hand young children
    build 3-dimensional structures out of LEGO with their hands. LEGO structures are
    cheap, quick and easy to make, reversible and most importantly they are more precise
    than the kids who build them. However, they are big and are only made out of ABS
    plastic. We believe that digital materials bring reversibility, simplicity, low
    cost and speed to free form fabrication in addition to a larger material set.
    Previous research on structures built out of many discrete parts involved self
    assembly \[1\], error correction self assembly \[2\], programmable self-assembly
    \[3\] and folding\[4\]. We rely on a digital printer, as presented in \[5\] which
    will assemble the structure by picking and placing the bricks forming the digital
    material. We define a digital material as a discrete set of components that can
    be of any sizes and shape, made out of various materials and that can fit together
    in various ways (press fit, friction fit, snap fit, reflow binding, etc.). However
    the components of a digital material must satisfy the following properties which
    are familiar to many toy assembly kits:'

  abstract: 2015 IEEE. Many critical tasks in robotics, such as locomotion or manipulation,
    involve collisions between a rigid body and the environment or between multiple
    bodies. Methods based on sums-of-squares (SOS) for numerical computation of Lyapunov
    certificates are a powerful tool for analyzing the stability of continuous nonlinear
    systems, and can additionally be used to automatically synthesize stabilizing
    feedback controllers. Here, we present a method for applying sums-of-squares verification
    to rigid bodies with Coulomb friction undergoing discontinuous, inelastic impact
    events. The proposed algorithm explicitly generates Lyapunov certificates for
    stability, positive invariance, and safety over admissible (non-penetrating) states
    and contact forces. We leverage the complementarity formulation of contact, which
    naturally generates the semialgebraic constraints that define this admissible
    region. The approach is demonstrated on multiple robotics examples, including
    simple models of a walking robot, a perching aircraft, and control design of a
    balancing robot.

  abstract: 'Within education, concepts such as distance learning, and open universities,
    are now becoming more widely used for teaching and learning. However, due to the
    nature of the subject domain, the teaching of Science, Technology, and Engineering
    are still relatively behind when using new technological approaches (particularly
    for online distance learning). The reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact
    that these fields often require laboratory exercises to provide effective skill
    acquisition and hands-on experience. Often it is difficult to make these laboratories
    accessible for online access. Either the real lab needs to be enabled for remote
    access or it needs to be replicated as a fully software-based virtual lab. We
    argue for the latter concept since it offers some advantages over remotely controlled
    real labs, which will be elaborated further in this paper. We are now seeing new
    emerging technologies that can overcome some of the potential difficulties in
    this area. These include: computer graphics, augmented reality, computational
    dynamics, and virtual worlds. This paper summarizes the state of the art in virtual
    laboratories and virtual worlds in the fields of science, technology, and engineering.
    The main research activity in these fields is discussed but special emphasis is
    put on the field of robotics due to the maturity of this area within the virtual-education
    community. This is not a coincidence; starting from its widely multidisciplinary
    character, robotics is a perfect example where all the other fields of engineering
    and physics can contribute. Thus, the use of virtual labs for other scientific
    and non-robotic engineering uses can be seen to share many of the same learning
    processes. This can include supporting the introduction of new concepts as part
    of learning about science and technology, and introducing more general engineering
    knowledge, through to supporting more constructive (and collaborative) education
    and training activities in a more complex engineering topic such as robotics.
    The objective of this paper is to outline this problem space in more detail and
    to create a valuable source of information that can help to define the starting
    position for future research.'

    One such feeding mechanism in shorebirds involves surface tension-induced transport
    of prey in millimetric droplets: By repeatedly opening and closing its beak in
    a tweezering motion, the bird moves the drop from the tip of its beak to its mouth
    in a stepwise ratcheting fashion. We have analyzed the subtle physical mechanism
    responsible for drop transport and demonstrated experimentally that the beak geometry
    and the dynamics of tweezering may be tuned to optimize transport efficiency.
    We also highlight the critical dependence of the capillary ratchet on the beak’s
    wetting properties, thus making clear the vulnerability of capillary feeders to
    surface pollutants.'

    of this technique,a virtual model controller requires the same skills asthe mechanism

  abstract: Bipedal robots are difficult to analyze mathematically. However, successful
    control strategies can be discovered using simple physical intuition and can be
    described in simple terms. Five things have to happen for a planar bipedal robot
    to walk. Height has to be stabilized. Pitch has to be stabilized. Speed has to
    be stabilized. The swing leg has to move so that the feet are in locations which
    allow for the stability of height, pitch, and speed. Finally, transitions from
    support leg to support leg must occur at appropriate times. If these five objectives
    are achieved, the robot will walk. A number of different intuitive control strategies
    can be used to achieve each of these five objectives. Further, each strategy can
    be implemented in a variety of ways. We present several strategies for each objective
    which we have implemented on a bipedal walking robot. Using these simple intuitive
    strategies, we have compelled a seven link planar bipedal robot, called Spring
    Flamingo, to walk. The robot walks both slowly and quickly, walks over moderate
    obstacles, starts, and stops

  container-title: 'First Ruperto Carola Symposium on Fast Motions in Biomechanics
    and Robotics: Optimization and Feedback Control'
  page: 1-27
  abstract: 1 Abstract We present velocity-based stability margins for fast bipedal
    walking that are sufficient conditions for stability, allow comparison between
    different walking algorithms, are measurable and computable, and are meaningful.
    While not completely necessary conditions, they are tighter necessary conditions
    than several previously proposed stability margins. The stability margins we present
    take into consideration a biped’s Center of Mass position and velocity, the reachable
    region of its swing leg, the time required to swing its swing leg, and the amount
    of internal angular momentum available for capturing balance. They predict the
    opportunity for the biped to place its swing leg in such a way that it can continue
    walking without falling down. We present methods for estimating these stability
    margins by using simple models of walking such as an inverted pendulum model and
    the Linear Inverted Pendulum model. We show that by considering the Center of
    Mass location with respect to the Center of Pressure on the foot, these estimates
    are easily computable. Finally, we show through simulation experiments on a 12
    degree-of-freedom distributed-mass lower-body biped that these estimates are useful
    for analyzing and controlling bipedal walking. 2 Introduction "How stable is your
    robot?" is a fundamental yet challenging question to answer, particularly with
    fast moving legged robots, such as dynamically balanced bipedal walkers. With
    many traditional control systems, questions of stability and robustness can be
    answered by eigenvalues, phase margins, loop gain margins, and other stability
    margins. However, legged robots are nonlin-ear, under-actuated, combine continuous
    and discrete dynamics, and do not necessarily have periodic motions. These features
    make applying traditional stability margins difficult.

  abstract: 'We present the mechanical design of a bipedal walking robot named M2V2,
    as well as control strategies to be implemented for walking and balance recovery.
    M2V2 has 12 actuated degrees of freedom in the lower body: three at each hip,
    one at each knee, and two at each ankle. Each degree of freedom is powered by
    a force controllable Series Elastic Actuator. These actuators provide high force
    fidelity and low impedance, allowing for control techniques that exploit the natural
    dynamics of the robot. The walking and balance recovery controllers will use the
    concepts of Capture Points and the Capture Region in order to decide where to
    step. A Capture Point is a point on the ground in which a biped can step to in
    order to stop, and the Capture Region is the locus of such points.'

  abstract: 'Imbalance suggests a feeling of dynamism and movement in static objects.
    It is therefore not surprising that many 3D models stand in impossibly balanced
    configurations. As long as the models remain in a computer this is of no consequence:
    the laws of physics do not apply. However, fabrication through 3D printing breaks
    the illusion: printed models topple instead of standing as initially intended.
    We propose to assist users in producing novel, properly balanced designs by interactively
    deforming an existing model. We formulate balance optimization as an energy minimization,
    improving stability by modifying the volume of the object, while preserving its
    surface details. This takes place during interactive editing: the user cooperates
    with our optimizer towards the end result. We demonstrate our method on a variety
    of models. With our technique, users can produce fabricated objects that stand
    in one or more surprising poses without requiring glue or heavy pedestals. Copyright

  container-title: IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems
  page: 1781-1788
  abstract: Many supporting activities that future service robots might perform in
    people’s homes depend on the capability to grasp and manipulate arbitrary objects.
    Easily accomplished by humans, but very difficult to achieve for robots, grasping
    involves dealing with a high-dimensional space of parameters which include hand
    kinematics, object geometry, material properties and forces. We believe that the
    way a robot grasps an object should be motivated by the object’s geometry and
    that the search space for stable grasps can be dramatically reduced if the underlying
    object representation reflects symmetry properties of the object that contain
    valuable information for grasp planning. In this paper, we introduce the grid
    of medial spheres, a volumetric object representation based on the medial axis
    transform. The grid of medial spheres represents arbitrarily shaped objects with
    arbitrary levels of detail and contains symmetry information that can be easily
    exploited by a grasp planning algorithm. We present the data structure as well
    as a grasp planning algorithm that exploits it and provide experimental results
    on various object models using two robot hands in simulation.

  abstract: '? 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.We study the detailed locomotor
    mechanics of a small, lightweight robot (DynaRoACH, 10 cm, 25 g) which can move
    on a granular substrate of closely packed 3 mm diameter glass particles at speeds
    up to 50 cm/s (5 body length/s), approaching the performance of small, highperforming,
    desert-dwelling lizards. To reveal how the robot achieves this high performance,
    we use high speed imaging to capture kinematics, and develop a numerical multi-body
    simulation of the robot coupled to an experimentally validated discrete element
    method (DEM) simulation of the granular media. Average forward speeds measured
    in both experiment and simulation agreed well, and increased non-linearly with
    stride frequency, reflecting a change in the mode of propulsion. At low frequencies,
    the robot used a quasi-static "rotary walking" mode, in which the granular material
    yielded as the legs penetrated and then solidified once vertical force balance
    was achieved. At high frequencies, duty factor decreased below 0.5 and aerial
    phases occurred. The propulsion mechanism was qualitatively different: the robot
    ran rapidly by utilizing the speed-dependent fluid-like inertial response of the
    material. We also used our simulation tool to vary substrate parameters that were
    inconvenient to vary in experiment (e.g., granular particle friction) to test
    performance and reveal limits of stability of the robot. Using small robots as
    physical models, our study reveals a mechanism by which small animals can achieve
    high performance on granular substrates, which in return advances the design and
    control of small robots in deformable terrains.'

  volume: '36'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: Heterogeneous objects are objects composed of different constituent materials.
    In these objects, multiple desirable properties from different constituent materials
    can be synthesized into one part. In order to obtain mass applications of such
    heterogeneous objects, efficient and effective design methodologies for heterogeneous
    objects are crucial. In this paper, we present a feature based design methodology
    to facilitate heterogeneous object design. Under this methodology, designers design
    heterogeneous objects using high-level design components that have engineering
    significance. These high level components are form features and material features.
    In this paper, we first examine the relationships between form features and material
    features in heterogeneous objects. We then propose three synthesized material
    features in accordance with our examination of these features. Based on these
    proposed features, we develop a feature based design methodology for heterogeneous
    objects. Two enabling methods for this design methodology, material heterogeneity
    specification within each feature and combination of these material features,
    are developed. A physics (diffusion) based B-spline method is developed to (1)
    allow design intent of material variation be explicitly captured by boundary conditions,
    (2) ensure smooth material variation across the feature volume. A novel method,
    direct face neighborhood alteration, is developed to increase the efficiency of
    combining heterogeneous material features. Examples of using this feature based
    design methodology for heterogeneous object design, such as a prosthesis design,
    are presented. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Less than half the Earth’s landmass is accessible to existing wheeled
    and tracked vehicles. But people and animals using their legs can go almost anywhere.
    Our mission at Boston Dynamics is to develop a new breed of rough-terrain robots
    that capture the mobility, autonomy and speed of living creatures. Such robots
    will travel in outdoor terrain that is too steep, rutted, rocky, wet, muddy, and
    snowy for conventional vehicles. They will travel in cities and in our homes,
    doing chores and providing care, where steps, stairways and household clutter
    limit the utility of wheeled vehicles. Robots meeting these goals will have terrain
    sensors, sophisticated computing and power systems, advanced actuators and dynamic
    controls. We will give a status report on BigDog, an example of such rough-terrain
    robots.

  abstract: This paper develops feedback controllers for walking in 3D, on level ground,
    with energy efficiency as the performance objective. Assume The Robot Is A Sphere
    (ATRIAS) 2.1 is a new robot that has been designed for the study of 3D bipedal
    locomotion, with the aim of combining energy efficiency, speed, and robustness
    with respect to natural terrain variations in a single platform. The robot is
    highly underactuated, having 6 actuators and, in single support, 13 degrees of
    freedom. Its sagittal plane dynamics are designed to embody the spring loaded
    inverted pendulum (SLIP), which has been shown to provide a dynamic model of the
    body center of mass during steady running gaits of a wide diversity of terrestrial
    animals. A detailed dynamic model is used to optimize walking gaits with respect
    to the cost of mechanical transport (CMT), a dimensionless measure of energetic
    efficiency, for walking speeds ranging from 0.5 (m/s) to 1.4 (m/s). A feedback
    controller is designed that stabilizes the 3D walking gaits, despite the high
    degree of underactuation of the robot. The 3D results are illustrated in simulation.
    In experiments on a planarized (2D) version of the robot, the controller yielded
    stable walking.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the hardware and control architecture of a
    novel four-fingered dextrous robot hand. The benefits of the unusual arrangement
    of the fingers (which resembles that in raptors and other birds) in the hand are
    discussed. Kinematic models for the fingers and transmission system are presented.
    A simulation and real-time control environment has been developed for the hand,
    and is discussed in the paper. Experiments in dextrous and dynamic manipulation
    using the hand are also detailed

  volume: '9'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: In analyses of human tutoring, the learning gains are often more strongly
    correlated with the student’s behavior during the tutoring session, rather than
    with the tutor’s behavior. However, we know of only one study that analyzes student
    reactions when they are working with a computer tutor. This motivated us to study
    the behavior of students when they worked with a step-based physics tutoring system,
    Andes. As students solved problems on Andes, they gave talk-aloud protocols that
    were recorded along with their computer screen. Our main finding is that when
    students asked the tutoring system for help after getting minimal negative feedback,
    they tended to learn new knowledge or be reminded of something they knew already.
    On the other hand, if they responded to minimal negative feedback by trying again
    repeatedly and not asking for a hint, then they tended to fail both to learn and
    to correct the mistake.

  container-title: Bioinspiration & Biomimetics
  page: '035008'
  volume: '10'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: This paper introduces a novel, bioinspired manipulator for minimally invasive
    surgery (MIS). The manipulator is entirely composed of soft materials, and it
    has been designed to provide similar motion capabilities as the octopus’s arm
    in order to reach the surgical target while exploiting its whole length to actively
    interact with the biological structures. The manipulator is composed of two identical
    modules (each of them can be controlled independently) with multi-directional
    bending and stiffening capabilities, like an octopus arm. In the authors’ previous
    works, the design of the single module has been addressed. Here a two-module manipulator
    is presented, with the final aim of demonstrating the enhanced capabilities that
    such a structure can have in comparison with rigid surgical tools currently employed
    in MIS. The performances in terms of workspace, stiffening capabilities, and generated
    forces are characterized through experimental tests. The combination of stiffening
    capabilities and manipulation tasks is also addressed to confirm the manipulator
    potential employment in a real surgical scenario.

  page: 17-54
  volume: '80'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The mechanics of lift and thrust generation by flying animals are studied
    by considering the distribution of vorticity in the wake. As wake generation is
    not continuous, the momentum jet theory, which has previously been used, is not
    satisfactory, and the vortex theory is a more realistic model. The vorticity shed
    by the wings in the course of each powered stroke deforms into a small-cored vortex
    ring; the wake is a chain of such rings. The momentum of each ring sustains and
    propels the animal; induced power is calculated as the rate of increase of wake
    kinetic energy. A further advantage of the vortex theory is that lift and induced
    drag coefficients are not required; estimated instantaneous values of these coefficients
    are generally too large for steady state aerodynamic theory to be appropriate
    to natural flapping flight. The vortex theory is applied to hovering of insects
    and to avian forward flight. A simple expression for induced power in hovering
    is found. Induced power is always greater than simple momentum jet estimates,
    and the discrepancy becomes substantial as body mass increases. In hovering the
    wake is composed of a stack of horizontal, coaxial, circular vortex rings. In
    forward flight of birds the rings are elliptic; they are neither horizontal nor
    coaxial because the momentum of each ring balances the vector sum of parasite
    and profile drag and the bird’s weight. Total power consumption as a function
    of flight velocity is calculated and compared for several species. Power reduction
    is one of the major factors influencing the choice of flight style. A large body
    of data is used to obtain an approximate scaling between stroke period and the
    body mass for birds. Together with relations between other morphological parameters,
    this is used to estimate the variation of flight speed and power with body mass
    for birds, and on this basis deviations from allometric scaling can be related
    to flight proficiency and to the use of such strategies as the bounding flight
    of small passerines.

  issue: May
  abstract: We describe a randomized incremental algorithm for computing the Delaunay
    triangulation of a set of points and a recent technique of applying it to terrain
    generation. The algorithm is optimal, using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based
    location structure for the incremental insertion which achieves an expected running
    time of O(n log n) and O(n) expected storage. The analysis of the expected storage
    is simplified, and the algorithm is implemented and tested. The implementation
    is done, in its integrality, with CGAL-Python which is fast and friendly, followed
    by numerical statistics on different distributions. The terrain generation technique
    is based on gaussian functions and the plotting is made with the Open Source software
    Blender 3D which is probably its first combination with CGAL-Python. A high quality
    rendering of three simple terrains is shown as a demonstration of the terrain
    generator. Mamaritra tetika fanamboarana ny fanatelozoroan’ i Delaunay ao aminy

  issue: December 1984
  abstract: A higher-order shear deformation theory of laminated composite plates
    is developed. The theory contains the same dependent unknowns as in the first-order
    shear deformation theory of Whitney and Pagano (1970), but accounts for parabolic
    distribution of the transverse shear strains through the thickness of the plate.
    Exact closed-form solutions of symmetric cross-ply laminates are obtained and
    the results are compared with three-dimensional elasticity solutions and first-order
    shear deformation theory solutions. The present theory predicts the deflections
    and stresses more accurately when compared to the first-order theory.

  abstract: A plate bending element based on the generalized laminate plate theory
    (GLPT) developed by the senior author is described and its accuracy is investigated
    by comparison with the exact solutions of the generalized plate theory and the
    3D-elasticity theory. The element accounts for transverse shear deformation and
    layer- wise description of the inplane displacements of the laminate. The element
    has improved description of the inplane as well as the transverse deformation
    response. A method for the computation of interlaminar (transverse) stresses is
    also presented. 1.

  abstract: In this work we detail a method that leverages the two color heads of
    recent low-end fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers to produce continuous
    tone imagery. The challenge behind producing such two-tone imagery is how to finely
    interleave the two colors while minimizing the switching between print heads,
    making each color printed span as long and continuous as possible to avoid artifacts
    associated with printing short segments. The key insight behind our work is that
    by applying small geometric offsets, tone can be varied without the need to switch
    color print heads within a single layer. We can now effectively print (two-tone)
    texture mapped models capturing both geometric and color information in our output
    3D prints. 2014 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum 2014 The Eurographics Association

    based on the theory of composite beams is presented. Under the assumption the
    in-plane displacements between layers are continuous and the transverse shear
    stresses between layers are also continuous. Equilibrium equations and boundary
    conditions which are similar to those of the classical plate theory are obtained.
    Exact closed-form solutions are compared with the three-dimensional elasticity
    solutions. The results of the present theory agree very closely with the exact
    solutions.

  volume: '7'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Control and modelling of continuum robots are challenging tasks for robotic
    researchers. Most works on modelling are limited to piecewise constant curvature.
    In many cases they neglect to model the actuators or avoid a continuum approach.
    In particular, in the latter case this leads to a complex model hardly implemented.
    In this work, a geometrically exact steady-state model of a tendon-driven manipulator
    inspired by the octopus arm is presented. It takes a continuum approach, fast
    enough to be implemented in the control law, and includes a model of the actuation
    system. The model was experimentally validated and the results are reported. In
    conclusion, the model presented can be used as a tool for mechanical design of
    continuum tendon-driven manipulators, for planning control strategies or as internal
    model in an embedded system.

  abstract: 'The new and promising field of soft robotics has many open areas of research
    such as the development of an exhaustive theoretical and methodological approach
    to dynamic modeling. To help contribute to this area of research, this paper develops
    a dynamic model of a continuum soft robot arm driven by cables and based upon
    a rigorous geometrically exact approach. The model fully investigates both dynamic
    interaction with a dense medium and the coupled tendon condition. The model was
    experimentally validated with satisfactory results, using a soft robot arm working
    prototype inspired by the octopus arm and capable of multibending. Experimental
    validation was performed for the octopus most characteristic movements: bending,
    reaching, and fetching. The present model can be used in the design phase as a
    dynamic simulation platform and to design the control strategy of a continuum
    robot arm moving in a dense medium.'

  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Robotics
  page: 1244-1251
  volume: '31'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: A common approach in designing legged robots is to build fully actuated
    machines and control the machine dynamics entirely in software, carefully avoiding
    impacts and expending a lot of energy. However, these machines are outperformed
    by their human and animal counterparts. Animals achieve their impressive agility,
    efficiency, and robustness through a close integration of passive dynamics, implemented
    through mechanical components, and neural control. Robots can benefit from this
    same integrated approach, but a strong theoretical framework is required to design
    the passive dynamics of a machine and exploit them for control. For this framework,
    we use a bipedal spring-mass model, which has been shown to approximate the dynamics
    of human locomotion. This paper reports the first implementation of spring-mass
    walking on a bipedal robot. We present the use of template dynamics as a control
    objective exploiting the engineered passive spring-mass dynamics of the ATRIAS
    robot. The results highlight the benefits of combining passive dynamics with dynamics-based
    control and open up a library of spring-mass model-based control strategies for
    dynamic gait control of robots.

  abstract: Design is a complex engineering activity, in which computers are more
    and more involved. The design task can often be seen as an optimization problem
    in which the parameters or the structure describing the best quality design are
    sought. Genetic algorithms constitute a class of search algorithms especially
    suited to solving complex optimization problems. In addition to parameter optimization,
    genetic algorithms are also suggested for solving problems in creative design,
    such as combining components in a novel, creative way. Genetic algorithms transpose
    the notions of evolution in Nature to computers and imitate natural evolution.
    Basically, they find solution(s) to a problem by maintaining a population of possible
    solutions according to the ‘survival of the fittest’ principle. We present here
    the main features of genetic algorithms and several ways in which they can solve
    difficult design problems. We briefly introduce the basic notions of genetic algorithms,
    namely, representation, genetic operators, fitness evaluation, and selection.
    We discuss several advanced genetic algorithms that have proved to be efficient
    in solving difficult design problems. We then give an overview of applications
    of genetic algorithms to different domains of engineering design.

  abstract: Actuation is essential for artificial machines to interact with their
    surrounding environment and to accomplish the functions for which they are designed.
    Over the past few decades, there has been considerable progress in developing
    new actuation technologies. However, controlled motion still represents a considerable
    bottleneck for many applications and hampers the development of advanced robots,
    especially at small length scales. Nature has solved this problem using molecular
    motors that, through living cells, are assembled into multiscale ensembles with
    integrated control systems. These systems can scale force production from piconewtons
    up to kilonewtons. By leveraging the performance of living cells and tissues and
    directly interfacing them with artificial components, it should be possible to
    exploit the intricacy and metabolic efficiency of biological actuation within
    artificial machines. We provide a survey of important advances in this biohybrid
    actuation paradigm.

  abstract: Given the complexity of the problem, genetic algorithms are one of the
    more promising methods of discovering control schemes for soft robotics. Since
    physically embodied evolution is time consuming and expensive, an outstanding
    challenge lies in developing fast and suitably realistic simulations in which
    to evolve soft robot gaits. We describe two parallel methods of using NVidia’s
    PhysX, a hardware-accelerated (GPGPU) physics engine, in order to evolve and optimize
    soft bodied gaits. The first method involves the evolution of open-loop gaits
    using a reduced-order lumped parameter model. The second method involves harnessing
    PhysX’s soft-bodied material simulation capabilites. In each case we discuss the
    the challenges and possibilities involved in using the PhysX for evolutionary
    soft robotics.

  abstract: Flying insects perform aerial maneuvers through slight manipulations of
    their wing motions. Because such manipulations in wing kinematics are subtle,
    a reliable method is needed to properly discern consistent kinematic strategies
    used by the insect from inconsistent variations and measurement error. Here, we
    introduce a novel automated method that accurately extracts full, 3D body and
    wing kinematics from high-resolution films of free-flying insects. This method
    combines visual hull reconstruction, principal components analysis, and geometric
    information about the insect to recover time series data of positions and orientations.
    The technique has small, well-characterized errors of under 3 pixels for positions
    and 5 deg. for orientations. To show its utility, we apply this motion tracking
    to the flight of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that fruit flies
    generate sideways forces during some maneuvers and that strong lateral acceleration
    is associated with differences between the left and right wing angles of attack.
    Remarkably, this asymmetry can be induced by simply altering the relative timing
    of flips between the right and left wings, and we observe that fruit flies employ
    timing differences as high as 10 g.

  volume: '106'

  abstract: 'A series of recent anatomical and functional data has radically changed
    our view on the organization of the motor cortex in primates. In the present article
    we present this view and discuss its fundamental principles. The basic principles
    are the following: (a) the motor cortex, defined as the agranular frontal cortex,
    is formed by a mosaic of separate areas, each of which contains an independent
    body movement representation, (b) each motor area plays a specific role in motor
    control, based on the specificity of its cortical afferents and descending projections,
    (c) in analogy to the motor cortex, the posterior parietal cortex is formed by
    a multiplicity of areas, each of which is involved in the analysis of particular
    aspects of sensory information. There are no such things as multipurpose areas
    for space or body schema and (d) the parieto-frontal connections form a series
    of segregated anatomical circuits devoted to specific sensorimotor transformations.
    These circuits transform sensory information into action. They represent the basic
    functional units of the motor system. Although these conclusions mostly derive
    from monkey experiments, anatomical and brain-imaging evidence suggest that the
    organization of human motor cortex is based on the same principles. Possible homologies
    between the motor cortices of humans and non-human primates are discussed.'

  container-title: Proceedings of the American Control Conference

  issue: '1'
  abstract: The ability of birds to perch robustly and ef- fectively is a powerful
    demonstration of the capabilities of nature’s control systems. Their apparent
    robustness to gust disturbances is particularly remarkable because when the airspeed
    approaches zero just before acquiring a perch, the influence of aerodynamic forces,
    and therefore potentially the control authority, is severely compromised. In this
    paper we present a simplified closed-form model for a fixed-wing aircraft which
    closely agrees with experimental indoor perching data. We then carefully examine
    the LTV controllability along an optimized perching trajectory for three different
    actuation scenarios - a glider (no powerplant), a fixed propeller, and a propeller
    with thrust vectoring. The results reveal that while all three vehicles are LTV
    controllable along the trajectory, the additional actuators allow the perch to
    be more easily acquired with less control surface deflections. However, in all
    three cases, disturbances experienced just before reaching the perch cannot be
    effectively rejected.

    new is that we combine two approaches: (1) using geometric constraints between
    components to eliminate interpretations, and interpretation tree methods for choosing
    the best active sensing move; (2) exploratory moves made by tracing continually
    along the surface of the object (and not through free space). We restrict ourselves
    to polyhedra, and give a set of geometric constraints tailored for matching components
    acquired from haptic exploration against components in the models. We present
    a new constraint using pairs of line segments. We then give a set of active sensing
    moves, each with an associated cost measure, and our strategies for choosing the
    next move.'

  abstract: In this work, we develop a cooperative launching system for a 13.2 gram
    ornithopter micro-aerial vehicle (MAV), the H\<sup\>2\</sup\>Bird, by carrying
    it on the back of a 32 gram hexapedal millirobot, the VelociRoACH. We determine
    the necessary initial velocity and pitch angle for take off using force data collected
    in a wind tunnel and use the VelociRoACH to reach these initial conditions for
    successful launch. In the wind tunnel predicted success region, we were able to
    complete a successful launch for 75 percent of the 12 trials in that region. Although
    carrying the H\<sup\>2\</sup\>Bird on top of the VelociRoACH at a stride frequency
    of 17 Hz increases our average power consumption by about 24.5 percent over solo
    running, the H\<sup\>2\</sup\>Bird, in turn, provides stability advantages to
    the VelociRoACH. We observed that the variance in pitch and roll velocity with
    the H\<sup\>2\</sup\>Bird is about 90 percent less than without. Additionally,
    with the H\<sup\>2\</sup\>Bird flapping at 5 Hz during transport, we observed
    an increase of 12.7 percent of the steady state velocity. Lastly, we found that
    the costs of transport for carrying the H\<sup\>2\</sup\>Bird flapping and without
    (6.6 and 6.8) are lower than the solo costs of transport for the VelociRoACH and
    for the H\<sup\>2\</sup\>Bird (8.1 and 10.1).

  page: 835-838
  abstract: We present an optical-based tactile sensor that utilizes light emitting
    diodes (LEDs) in combination with a semi-opaque compliant medium. Previously we
    have presented this technology in application to sensing either force or a combination
    of point force and position. In this paper we now consider the application of
    this sensor to the sensing of object size. We propose a modification that enables
    sensing of the size on an incident object whilst retaining the previous sensing
    abilities. This is achieved by introducing a second deformable layer that may
    optionally have different compressive and/or optically transmission properties.
    We present results of sensing the size of different objects using this modified
    sensor and consider the simultaneous measurement of force, size and position.
    This triple-sensing action, along with the soft nature of the sensor medium, is
    especially important in applications where the sensing elements may be widely
    dispersed, for example in safe and compliant robot skin covering.

  issue: '7082'
  abstract: ’Bottom-up fabrication’, which exploits the intrinsic properties of atoms
    and molecules to direct their self-organization, is widely used to make relatively
    simple nanostructures. A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures
    of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by ’top-down’ methods. The
    self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal.
    Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules
    into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made
    by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by
    choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide ’staple strands’ to hold the scaffold
    in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble
    in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter
    and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with
    a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm
    pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words
    and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed
    to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer
    of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).

  page: 57-68
  volume: '7'
  abstract: With the integration of multiaxis layered manu- facturing and material
    removal (machining) pro- cesses, a hybrid system has more capability and flexibility
    to build complicated geometry with a single setup. Process planning to integrate
    the two different processes is a key issue. In this paper, an algorithm of adaptive
    slicing for a five-axis Laser Aided Manufacturing Process (LAMP) is summa- rized
    that can generate uniform and non-uniform thickness slices. A method to build
    a non-uniform (thickness) layer that utilizes two processes is pre- sented, and
    an overall algorithm for integration is described. The newly developed algorithm
    implemented in the process planning helps the hybrid system build parts more efficiently.

  abstract: Conventionally, engineers have employed rigid materials to fabricate precise,
    predictable robotic systems, which are easily modelled as rigid members connected
    at discrete joints. Natural systems, however, often match or exceed the performance
    of robotic systems with deformable bodies. Cephalopods, for example, achieve amazing
    feats of manipulation and locomotion without a skeleton; even vertebrates such
    as humans achieve dynamic gaits by storing elastic energy in their compliant bones
    and soft tissues. Inspired by nature, engineers have begun to explore the design
    and control of soft-bodied robots composed of compliant materials. This Review
    discusses recent developments in the emerging field of soft robotics.

  page: 750-757
  volume: 2016-June
  abstract: This paper introduces a manufacturing technique which enables the integration
    of soft materials and soft fluidic micro-actuators in the Pop-up book MEMS paradigm.
    Such a technique represents a promising approach to the design and fabrication
    of low cost and scalable articulated mechanisms provided with sensing capabilities
    and on-board actuation with potential applications in the field of minimally invasive
    surgery. Design and integration of soft components in the rigid-flex laminates
    is described along with the resulting soft pop-up mechanisms realized at different
    scales. Prototype characterization is presented, demonstrating forces and dexterity
    in a range suitable for surgical applications, as well as the possibility to integrate
    sensing capabilities. Based on these results, a multi-articulated robotic arm
    is fabricated and mounted on top of an endoscope model to provide a proof of concept
    of simple robotic mechanisms that could be useful in a surgical scenario.

  abstract: Contemporary prostheses have developed from small iterations on moderately
    successful archetypes. This has resulted in modern designs that can either be
    termed cosmetic or functional, with neither attribute being fully satisfied. A
    new strategy is needed to develop a generation of upper-limb prostheses that will
    integrate both cosmetic and functional requirements in a single device. It is
    hypothesized that design principles applicable to a new generation of prostheses
    will result from exploring close analogies to the human upper limb. A method of
    practice led design research has been adopted to explore appropriate analogies,
    using the production of physical models to elucidate the design problem to the
    design team and other interested parties. This method uses a consciously iterative
    approach whereby criticisms and lessons learnt in the development of early models
    are embodied in subsequent models. This paper describes the first iterative cycle.
    It includes a critical review of the devices currently available and a study of
    mechanical analogies to original anatomy which form two of the inputs to the development
    of a skeletal model hand. It details the lessons learnt from this study and concludes
    on the wider application of practice led design research in medical engineering.

    root</span>
  container-title: 2013 ieee international conference on robotics and automation
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 3457-3462
  abstract: In this paper we propose a soil penetration robotic system inspired by
    low friction penetration strategies in plant roots. Growth of cells at the root
    tip deforms soil, while sloughing cells in the cap create an interface between
    root and soil to reduce root-soil friction during penetration. A simple prototype,
    inspired by these root features and based on a tubular shaft and a soft continuum
    skin, was developed. The skin is kept inside the shaft and slips out and slides
    on its external body. This outward movement of the skin opens the soil in front
    of the tip and helps the system to penetrate. The skin covering the external body
    of shaft imitates the role of sloughing cells and provides low-friction interface
    between soil and shaft. Interaction between the external skin and soil gives to
    the system self-anchorage capabilities for the penetration. The performances of
    our robotic system were characterized during penetration in granular soils. The
    skin-soil interaction was found to be fundamental for 1) displacing the soil in
    front of the tip and 2) preventing backward movements of the robot by anchoring
    the posterior body to the soil. In order to exploit these effects some artificial
    hairs were added along the skin. The increased hair density (0.012 hairs/mm2)
    resulted in higher penetration depth of robot (about 30

  abstract: We present the design, manufacturing, and characterization of a soft textile-based
    clutch (TBC) that uses vacuum stimulation to switch between locking and unlocking
    its linear displacement. The vacuum locks the relative sliding motion between
    two elaborated textile webbings with an elastic silicone rubber bag. Various fabrication
    techniques, such as silicone casting on textiles and melt embossing for direct
    fabrication of miniature patterns on textile and sewing, were used to develop
    three groups of TBC samples based on friction and interlocking principles. Their
    performance was compared in a blocking configuration. The clutch with an interlocking
    mechanism presented the highest withstanding force (150 N) compared to that (54
    N) recorded for the friction-based clutch. The simple and compact structure of
    the proposed clutch, together with the intrinsic adaptability of fabric with other
    clothing and soft materials, make it an appropriate solution for applications
    in soft wearable robotics and generally as a locking and variable stiffness solution
    for soft robotic applications.

  abstract: He number of women in science and engineering is growing, yet men continue
    to outnumber women, especially at the upper levels of these professions. In elementary,
    middle, and high school, girls and boys take math and science courses in roughly
    equal numbers, and about as many girls as boys leave high school prepared to pursue
    science and engineering majors in college. Yet fewer women than men pursue these
    majors. Among first-year college students, women are much less likely than men
    to say that they intend to major in science, technology, engineering, or math
    (STEM). By graduation, men outnumber women in nearly every science and engineering
    field, and in some, such as physics, engineering, and computer science, the difference
    is dramatic, with women earning only 20 percent of bachelor’s degrees. Women’s
    representation in science and engineering declines further at the graduate level
    and yet again in the transition to the workplace. Drawing on a large and diverse
    body of research, this report presents eight recent research findings that provide
    evidence that social and environmental factors contribute to the under-representation
    of women in science and engineering. (Contains 21 figures, 13 footnotes, and a
    bibliography.) This report was supported by the Letitia Corum Memorial Fund, the

    steel triangular beams that are used for the rigid elements of the structure.
    It includes the development of a folding fixture to bend stainless steel sheets
    and the determination of a folding angle sequence by static analysis using a compliant
    mechanism model. The semi-automatic process of using a millirobot (orthotweezers)
    to manipulate and assemble the beams and attach the flexures is described in detail.
    The paper ends with a description of the procedure used to design the wrist.

  volume: '2006'
  abstract: This paper discusses the biomimetic design and assembly of a 3g self-contained
    crawling robot fabricated through the integrated use of various microrobot technologies.
    The hexapod structure is designed to move in an alternating tripod gait driven
    by two piezoelectric actuators connected by sliding plates to two sets of three
    legs. We present results of both the kinematic and static analyses of the driving
    mechanism that essentially consists of three slider cranks in series. This analysis
    confirmed the force differential needed to propel the device. We then review various
    other microrobot technologies that have been developed including actuator design
    and fabrication, power and control electronics design, programming via a finite
    state machine, and the development of bioinspired fiber arrays. These technologies
    were then successfully integrated into the device. The robot is now functioning
    and we have already fabricated three iterations of the proposed device. We hope
    with further design iterations to produce a fully operational model in the near
    future

  volume: '29'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: This paper studies flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAV) whose transmission
    mechanisms use flexures as energy storage elements to reduce needed input power.
    A distinguishing feature of the proposed four-bar mechanism is the use of rubber-based
    flexures in two of its joints. These lightweight and compact flexures have been
    used for the first time in the design of an FWMAV whose projected total weight
    is approximately 3 g. This paper discusses in detail how the flexures were designed
    and how the challenges associated with their fabrication were met. Flexure stiffnesses
    were chosen based upon a simple, computationally efficient model of the four-bar
    mechanism actuated by an electric motor to flap two wings at 18 Hz. An instrumented
    test stand was designed to easily replace the upper part of the four-bar flexure
    mechanism and wings, and it was used to experimentally determine the power savings
    associated with flexures of different stiffnesses. While the measured power savings

  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 1258-1263
  volume: '2005'
  abstract: We are developing a process to quickly prototype millirobotic systems
    in which the approach is to identify and develop a construction kit for fabricating
    almost any design, similar to the kits that are available for larger-scale robots.
    Two of the basic elements of the kit, the links and flexure joints, have been
    identified, and an assembly method has been developed. This paper deals with the
    problem of integrating the wiring in these parts, a significant task on this size
    scale. This novel feature is achieved through the use of a flexible ribbon cable
    consisting of three wires made out of patterned copper foil and polyimide. Low
    melting point solder has been tested successfully to make the electrical interconnect
    between the parts. We discuss the issues that must be addressed in designing the
    flexure-wiring combination. In addition, the paper presents the methodology for
    fabricating structures with integrated wiring using a simple four bar mechanism
    as an example. Finally, the tests show that the wiring loop over a flexure connecting
    a distally located sensor on the mechanism maintains both its electrical and mechanical
    integrity even during large motions. Future work will include the automated assembly
    of the parts with a low cost assembly tool.

  abstract: Traditionally, origami-based structures are designed on the premise of
    “rigid folding,” However, every act of folding and unfolding is accompanied by
    elastic deformations in real structures. This study focuses on these elastic deformations
    in order to expand ori- gami into a new method of designing morphing structures.
    The authors start by proposing a simple model for evaluating elastic deformation
    in nonrigid origami structures. Next, these methods are applied to deployable
    plate models. Initial strain is introduced into the elastic parts as actuators
    for deployment. Finally, by using the finite element method (FEM), it is confirmed
    that the proposed system can accomplish the complete deployment in 3?3 Miura-or
    model.

  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: 5624-5628
  volume: '114'
  issue: '22'
  abstract: 'Ladybird beetles are high-mobility insects and explore broad areas by
    switching between walking and flying. Their excellent wing transformation systems
    enabling this lifestyle are expected to provide large potential for engineering
    applications. However, the mechanism behind the folding of their hindwings remains
    unclear. The reason is that ladybird beetles close the elytra ahead of wing folding,
    preventing the observation of detailed processes occurring under the elytra. In
    the present study, artificial transparent elytra were transplanted on living ladybird
    beetles, thereby enabling us to observe the detailed wing-folding processes. The
    result revealed that in addition to the abdominal movements mentioned in previous
    studies, the edge and ventral surface of the elytra, as well as characteristic
    shaped veins, play important roles in wing folding. The structures of the wing
    frames enabling this folding process and detailed 3D shape of the hindwing were
    investigated using microcomputed tomography. The results showed that the tape
    spring-like elastic frame plays an important role in the wing transformation mechanism.
    Compared with other beetles, hindwings in ladybird beetles are characterized by
    two seemingly incompatible properties: (i) the wing rigidity with relatively thick
    veins and (ii) the compactness in stored shapes with complex crease patterns.
    The detailed wing-folding process revealed in this study is expected to facilitate
    understanding of the naturally optimized system in this excellent deployable structure.'

  abstract: 'Research in feature-based design is reviewed. Feature-based design is
    regarded as a key factor towards CAD/CAPP integration from a process planning
    point of view. From a design point of view, feature-based design offers possibilities
    for supporting the design process better than current CAD systems do. The evolution
    of feature definitions is briefly discussed. Features and their role in the design
    process and as representatives of design-objects and design-object knowledge are
    discussed. The main research issues related to feature-based design are outlined.
    These are: feature representation, features and tolerances, feature validation,
    multiple viewpoints towards features, features and standardization, and features
    and languages. An overview of some academic feature-based design systems is provided.
    Future research issues in feature-based design are outlined. The conclusion is
    that feature-based design is still in its infancy, and that more research is needed
    for a better support of the design process and better integration with manufacturing,
    although major advances have already been made. ?? 1993.'

  volume: '37'

  abstract: In this paper, a new feature-based method is proposed to represent and
    design heterogeneous objects. Material governing features are defined to control
    material composition inside the objects. Interrelations between the material governing
    features and material attributes are established in the design process and retained
    in the object model. Free-form B-spline functions are used to represent complex
    shapes of geometry and material features. A new material feature blending method
    is used to determine continuous material variation. To obtain the best material
    features, an optimization problem is constructed based on the object’s functional
    requirements. Variant models are easily generated by changing the geometric and
    material features using the constraints between them. Implementation and examples
    are also presented in this paper. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  abstract: This paper reports the applicability of our passivity-based contact force
    control framework for biped humanoids. We experimentally demonstrate its adaptation
    to unknown rough terrain. Adaptation to uneven ground is achieved by optimally
    distributed antigravitational forces applied to preset contact points in a feedforward
    manner, even without explicitly measuring the external forces or the terrain shape.
    Adaptation to unknown inclination is also possible by combining an active balancing
    controller based on the center-of-mass (CoM) measurements with respect to the
    inertial frame. Furthermore, we show that a simple impedance controller for supporting
    the feet or hands allows the robot to adapt to low-friction ground without prior
    knowledge of the ground friction. This presentation includes supplementary experimental
    videos that show a full-sized biped humanoid robot balancing on uneven ground
    or time-varying inclination.

  abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that monkeys and humans can use signals
    from the brain to guide computer cursors. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) may
    one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively
    low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy
    with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems
    relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations
    of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram
    recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design
    and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor
    cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported. These results
    indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with
    a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or approximately
    15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is
    achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality
    degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system
    design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans.

  container-title: Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  page: 1125-1131
  abstract: The adhesive and frictional properties of dry adhesive materials can be
    described by a three-dimensional limit surface in the space of normal and tangential
    contact forces at the feet. We present the empirically derived limit surface for
    directional adhesive pads and illustrate its application to controlling the forces
    at the feet of a robot climbing on arbitrary slopes, including overhanging surfaces.
    For the directional adhesive patches that we have developed, the limit surface
    is convex, which permits efficient computation of the desired internal and external
    forces among the feet to maximize a safety margin with respect to disturbance
    forces on the robot. The limit surface also intersects the origin in force space,
    which enables efficient climbing without wasting energy in attaching and detaching
    the feet. These insights are applied to an experimental climbing platform demonstrating
    the proper use of directional adhesion and mimicking the climbing behavior seen
    in geckos.

    Mini Robot</span>
  container-title: Proceedings 2007 ieee international conference on robotics and
    automation
  collection-number: April
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 467-472
  abstract: This paper describes the design of a fast long-jumping robot conceived
    to move in unstructured environments through simple feed-forward control laws.
    Despite the apparent similarities with hopping, jumping dynamics is peculiar and
    involve non-trivial issues on actuation powering, energy saving and stability.
    The "Grillo" robot described here is a quadruped, 50-mm robot that weights about
    15 grams and is suited for a long-jumping gait. Inspired by frog locomotion, a
    tiny motor load the springs connected to the hind limbs. At take-off, an escapement
    mechanism releases the loaded springs. This provides a peak power output that
    can exceed several times the maximum motor power. In this way, the actuation and
    energy systems can be significantly reduced in weight and size. On the other hand,
    passive dynamics is exploited by compliant forelegs, that let to partially recover
    the impact energy in their elastic recoil. Equipped with a 0.2W DC motor, the
    robot is dimensioned to achieve a forward speed of 1.5 m/s, which corresponds
    to about 30 body length per second.

  abstract: From an engineering point of view, bio-inspiration can suggest mechanisms,
    design and functions successfully improving the state of the art in robotics.
    Engineers can study scaling effects in animal locomotion in order to determine
    the optimal gait for a given-size robot. In this paper the design of a miniature
    jumping robot is presented. Inspired by small jumping animals, the robot performs
    catapult jumps, using an elastic energy storage and a release mechanism. Compliant
    forelegs are completely passive, and cushion the landing re-using part of the
    impact energy. The influence of compliance and elastic energy storage on performances
    is discussed. Spring stiffness and elongation are dimensioned according to design
    limitations and energy constraints, avoiding early loss of ground contact, i.e.
    take-off before complete leg extension. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  abstract: This paper presents a set of algorithms for use in simultaneous localization
    and mapping during haptic exploration. Several solutions are provided for the
    problem of a single spherical robot finger exploring a known smooth surface, starting
    with an unknown pose. Using pose estimates, pattern matching is performed between
    the robot’s internal model of the surface and the known model. The robot finger
    is guided to explore regions of the surface that will maximize the probability
    of recognition. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of one algorithm.
    In addition, it is shown that haptic exploration and dexterous manipulation can
    be achieved concurrently when multiple robot fingers are used.

  abstract: 'The influence of ankle compliance on bipedal robot locomotion is investigated
    in this paper. The focus is on reduction of energy consumption. The concept of
    hybrid zero dynamics is adapted to design walking gaits with three phases: underactuated
    heel roll, full actuation and underactuated toe roll. Ankle springs work in parallel
    with the ankle actuators. Stiffness and offset of the linear torsional springs
    at the ankle and gait parameters are optimized simultaneously. It is shown that
    simultaneous optimization of spring properties and gait is superior to optimizing
    the spring after the gait. Optimal spring stiffness and offset lead to a major
    reduction in energy consumption. Furthermore, a more human-like gait is observed
    for simultaneous optimization of gait and spring parameters compared to gait optimization
    with zero stiffness.'

  volume: '28'
  abstract: 'Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both
    Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and Career
    and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two educational emphases
    and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum engagement. The objective of
    this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in
    an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting
    all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease
    the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper
    reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools
    designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of
    disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer,
    shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop,
    the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated
    in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in
    OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers
    completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers
    were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built
    3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their
    schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with
    online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed
    engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology,
    paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers
    based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the
    teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential
    for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering
    and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies
    have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting
    from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.'

  abstract: This paper describes two folded metamaterials based on the Miura-ori fold
    pattern. The structural mechanics of these metamaterials are dominated by the
    kinematics of the folding, which only depends on the geometry and therefore is
    scale-independent. First, a folded shell structure is introduced, where the fold
    pattern provides a negative Poisson’s ratio for in-plane deformations and a positive
    Poisson’s ratio for out-of-plane bending. Second, a cellular metamaterial is described
    based on a stacking of individual folded layers, where the folding kinematics
    are compatible between layers. Additional freedom in the design of the metamaterial
    can be achieved by varying the fold pattern within each layer.

  abstract: By introducing a ‘local’ texture to thin-walled sheets, the ‘global’ mechanical
    properties of the sheets can be favourably modified. In this paper we explore
    the intriguing mechanical properties of Folded Textured Sheets, by way of two
    examples. The fold patterns allow the sheets to undergo large deformations, as
    well as change their global Gaussian curvature without stretching the material.
    Furthermore, both example sheets share the remarkable property that their Poisson’s
    ratio under bending is of opposite sign to that under extension. The properties
    of the sheets were studied using a simple numerical model, where the folded sheets
    are represented by a pin-jointed framework; this captures the key deformation
    modes.

  container-title: 2008 ieee international conference on robotics and automation
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 2171-2176
  abstract: This paper presents design and performance of a novel joint based actuator
    for a robot run by Variable Stiffness Actuation, meant for systems physically
    interacting with humans. This new actuator prototype (VSA-II) is developed as
    an improvement over our previously developed one reported in \[9\], where an optimal
    mechanical-control codesign principle established in \[7\] is followed as well.
    While the first version was built in a way to demonstrate effectiveness of Variable
    Impedance Actuation (VIA), it had limitations in torque capacities, life cycle
    and implementability in a real robot. VSA-II overcomes the problem of implementability
    with higher capacities and robustness in design for longer life. The paper discusses
    design and stiffness behaviour of VSA-II in theory and experiments. A comparison
    of stiffness characteristics between the two actuator is discussed, highlighting
    the advantages of the new design. A simple, but effective PD scheme is employed
    to independently control joint-stiffness and joint-position of a 1-link arm. Finally,
    results from performed impact tests of 1-link arm are reported, showing the effectiveness
    of stiffness variation in controlling value of a safety metric. 2008 IEEE.

  abstract: Nine cases of relatively selective hand weakness produced by stroke were
    analyzed to examine the degree to which representations of different fingers are
    segregated in the human primary motor cortex (M1). In five cases, all the digits
    were involved uniformly; in four cases the radial versus ulnar digits of the hand
    were involved differentially. No patient showed discrete involvement of a single
    digit, nor did any patient have greatest weakness in the index, middle or ring
    finger. These findings provide little evidence that each digit is represented
    in a separate cortical territory, but rather suggest that broadly overlapping
    gradients - with the radial digits somewhat more heavily represented laterally
    and the ulnar digits somewhat more heavily represented medially - are superimposed
    on an underlying organization in which control of each finger is distributed widely
    throughout the human M1 hand area.

  container-title: Journal of neurophysiology
  page: 2125-43
  volume: '86'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: 'Since the 1870s, the primary motor cortex (M1) has been known to have
    a somatotopic organization, with different regions of cortex participating in
    control of face, arm, and leg movements. Through the middle of the 20th century,
    it seemed possible that the principle of somatotopic organization extended to
    the detailed representation of different body parts within each of the three major
    representations. The arm region of M1, for example, was thought to contain a well-ordered,
    point-to-point representation of the movements or muscles of the thumb, index,
    middle, ring, and little fingers, the wrist, elbow, and shoulder, as conveyed
    by the iconic homunculus and simiusculus. In the last quarter of the 20th century,
    however, experimental evidence has accumulated indicating that within-limb somatotopy
    in M1 is not spatially discrete nor sequentially ordered. Rather, beneath gradual
    somatotopic gradients of representation, the representations of different smaller
    body parts or muscles each are distributed widely within the face, arm, or leg
    representation, such that the representations of any two smaller parts overlap
    extensively. Appreciation of this underlying organization will be essential to
    further understanding of the contribution to control of movement made by M1. Because
    no single experiment disproves a well-ordered within-limb somatotopic organization
    in M1, here I review the accumulated evidence, using a framework of six major
    features that constrain the somatotopic organization of M1: convergence of output,
    divergence of output, horizontal interconnections, distributed activation, effects
    of lesions, and ability to reorganize. Review of the classic experiments that
    led to development of the homunculus and simiusculus shows that these data too
    were consistent with distributed within-limb somatotopy. I conclude with speculations
    on what the constrained somatotopy of M1 might tell us about its contribution
    to control of movement.'

    overlap might be artifactual or else might indicate that activation of M1 to produce
    a finger movement occurs over a more widespread cortical area than usually assumed.
    These possibilities were distinguished in monkeys moving different fingers. Recordings
    showed that single M1 neurons were active with movements of different fingers.
    Neuronal populations active with movements of different fingers overlapped extensively.
    Control of any finger movement thus appears to utilize a population of neurons
    distributed throughout the M1 hand area rather than a somatotopically segregated
    population.

  title: Dextrous Hand Regrasping Using Hybrid System Models
  container-title: IEEE conference on advanced intelligent mechatronics
  abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to force planning during multi-fngered
    regrasping. Hybrid (discrete-continuous) system models are used for reference
    generation for the regrasping finger. An impedance control algorithm including
    a real-time applicable grasping force optimization method implements the regrasping
    task. Simulation results show the efficiency and simplicity of our approach to
    regrasping.

  container-title: IEEE international conference on robotics and automation
  page: 103-108
  abstract: This paper presents an approach to fast object manipulation by dextrous
    regrasping of multi-fngered hands. The approach is based on a real-time grasping
    force optimization algorithm (GFO) and a fngertip impedance control scheme. Both
    the controller and the GFO make use of 6D contact force sensor data at run-time.
    The latter keeps contact forces as small as possible while considering friction
    limits at the contact points during (re)grasping. The impedance controller is
    used to impose optimized contact forces onto the grasped object while simultaneously
    enabling active control of the fngertip positions. Experiments demonstrate the
    robustness of the approach and the increase in task speed during multi-fngered
    manipulation.

  abstract: We study the dynamics and stability of legged locomotion in the horizontal
    plane. Motivated by experimental studies of insects, we develop two- and three-degree-of
    freedom rigid body models with pairs of ’virtual’ elastic legs in intermittent
    contact with the ground. We focus on conservative compliant-legged models, but
    we also consider prescribed forces, prescribed leg displacements, and combined
    strategies. The resulting mechanical systems exhibit periodic gaits whose stability
    characteristics are due to intermittent foot contact, and are largely determined
    by geometrical criteria. Most strikingly, we show that mechanics alone can confer
    asymptotic stability in heading and body orientation. In a companion paper, we
    apply our results to rapidly running cockroaches.

  abstract: Materials with controllable stiffness are of great interest to many fields,
    including medicine and robotics. In this paper we develop a new type of variable
    stiffness material based on the combination of a rigid low-melting-point-alloy
    (LMPA) microstructure embedded in soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). This material
    can transition between rigid and soft states by controlling the phase of the LMPA
    through efficient, direct Joule-heating of the LMPA microstructure. The devices
    tested demonstrate a relative stiffness change of \>25× (elastic modulus is 40
    MPa when LMPA is solid and 1.5 MPa when LMPA is liquid) and a fast transition
    from rigid to soft states (\<1 s) at low power (\<500 mW). Additionally, the material
    possesses inherent state (soft and rigid) and strain sensing (GF = 0.8) based
    on resistance changes. 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

  page: 1-17
  abstract: This paper aims to democratize the design and fabrication of robots, enabling
    people of all skill levels to make robots without needing expert domain knowledge.
    Existing work in computational design and rapid fabrication has explored this
    question of customization for physical objects but so far has not been able to
    conquer the complexity of robot designs. We have developed Interactive Robogami,
    a tool for composition-based design of ground robots that can be fabricated as
    flat sheets and then folded into 3D structures. This rapid prototyping process
    enables users to create lightweight, affordable, and materially versatile robots
    with short turnaround time. Using Interactive Robogami, designers can compose
    new robot designs from a database of print-and-fold parts. The designs are tested
    for the users’ functional specifications via simulation and fabricated on user
    satisfaction. We present six robots designed and fabricated using a 3D printing
    based approach, as well as a larger robot cut from sheet metal. We have also conducted
    a user study that demonstrates that our tool is intuitive for novice designers
    and expressive enough to create a wide variety of ground robot designs.

  abstract: A fused filament fabrication printer has a fixed extrusion module having
    multiple printheads having print tips. The fixed arrangement of the printing heads
    allows the close spacing of multiple print tips in a printhead unit, and the simple
    routing of multiple plastic or metal filaments to the individual printing heads.
    The closely spaced print tips in the printhead unit share common components. An
    exemplary printhead unit has four printing heads which share a common heating
    block and heating block temperature sensor. The heating block incorporates a group
    of four print tips evenly spaced along a line. Each printing head has a separate
    filament which is controlled and driven by its own stepper motor through the heating
    block to one of the print tips. Printing of a part is by control of individual
    stepper motors which drive filaments through the heating block and through one
    of the printing tips.

  page: 3498-3503
  abstract: The uncertain and dynamic terrain within an urban search and rescue (USAR)
    scenario presents an enormous challenge to the mobility of any robotic platform.
    To maximise the chance of success the design must be performed with consideration
    of the likely target environment. Current knowledge on building collapse debris
    fields suggest that robots must be able to move through and underneath debris
    utilizing void spaces. Due to the likely chance of void spaces being partially
    blocked, an USAR robot should have manipulation capability, a very under-explored
    area of USAR robotics. The moving of debris can be likened to the digging action
    of some animals such as the European mole. The current work proposes a novel digging
    mechanism that is simulated using MSC visualNastran 4D and controlled using Matlab
    Simulink and shown to have distinct efficiency benefits

  abstract: This paper addresses the long-standing problem of the unavoidable gaps
    that arise when expressing the intersection of two NURBS surfaces using conventional
    trimmed-NURBS representation. The solution converts each trimmed NURBS into an
    untrimmed T-Spline, and then merges the untrimmed T-Splines into a single, watertight
    model. The solution enables watertight fillets of NURBS models, as well as arbitrary
    feature curves that do not have to follow iso-parameter curves. The resulting
    T-Spline representation can be exported without error as a collection of NURBS
    surfaces.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a generalization of non-uniform B-spline surfaces
    called T-splines. T-spline control grids permit T-junctions, so lines of control
    points need not traverse the entire control grid. T-splines support many valuable
    operations within a consistent framework, such as local refinement, and the merging
    of several B-spline surfaces that have different knot vectors into a single gap-free
    model. The paper focuses on T-splines of degree three, which are C2 (in the absence
    of multiple knots). T-NURCCs (Non-Uniform Rational Catmull-Clark Surfaces with
    T-junctions) are a superset of both T-splines and Catmull-Clark surfaces. Thus,
    a modeling program for T-NURCCs can handle any NURBS or Catmull-Clark model as
    special cases. T-NURCCs enable true local refinement of a Catmull-Clark-type control
    grid: individual control points can be inserted only where they are needed to
    provide additional control, or to create a smoother tessellation, and such insertions
    do not alter the limit surface. T-NURCCs use stationary refinement rules and are
    C2 except at extraordinary points and features.'

  abstract: This study investigated the differences between computer-based and paper-based
    low-fidelity prototypes. It researched whether subjects confronted with these
    two kinds of prototypes differ in their willingness to criticize a system and
    to give suggestions for its improvement. The chosen approach was an empirical
    study including test sessions using both kinds of prototypes. Quantitative and
    qualitative methods were applied to measure and to explain possible differences.

  abstract: This paper describes a profiled metallic sheet with discrete, self-locking
    modes of deformation, which can be curved, flattened or asymmetrical. This behaviour
    is achieved by depressing dimples on its surface, and is completely reversible.
    The governing mechanism depends on the interaction between residual stresses and
    non-linear deformation coupled to the orientation of each dimple, resulting in
    complex distortions; we predict these changes in shape using a straightforward
    computational model, which will expedite the design of novel morphing structures.

  abstract: 2014 IEEE. Legged locomotion is an open problem in robotics, particularly
    for non-level surfaces. With decreasing robot size, different issues for climbing
    mechanisms and their attachment and detachment appear due to the physics of scaling.
    This paper describes micro-scale phenomena for different adhesion methods that
    can be employed in microrobots. These adhesion methods are applied to a sub-2
    gram legged robot, the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot (HAMR), by leveraging recent
    advances in milli- and micrometer-scale manufacturing. The presented designs utilize
    different passively oriented adhesives on the legs of the robot to improve inclined
    locomotion performance. A 3DoF ankle joint is designed and implemented and the
    effects of a passive tail are studied. As a result, HAMR’s climbing capability
    is increased from 3° inclines to 22° inclines and 45° declines. Finally, an analytical
    model of leg and foot force generation is presented and compared with experimental
    force data from the attachment mechanism on a single-leg experimental setup.

  container-title: 2017 ieee international conference on robotics and automation (icra)
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 5962-5968
  abstract: 2017 IEEE. Legged robots can explore unstructured environments more effectively
    than wheeled robots, but high turning rate tracking is still a challenging problem,
    particularly on varying surfaces. Previous steering methods with small robots
    have shown high turn rates, but usually only on a limited set of surfaces. This
    paper proposes a new method for steering a miniaturized legged robot by cooperation
    between two robots connected by a compliant joint, creating a 73 gram, 12 legged
    robot. Detailed design issues and an empirical verification are presented for
    several cooperation strategies, including changing velocities of the 4 sets of
    leg triples. The robots use their combined traction forces to turn at better than
    50 degrees/sec at 1 m/sec on various surfaces. Closed-loop steering using a differential
    drive strategy is implemented on the connected robots to track a ’figure 8’ trajectory
    on a tile surface.

    Actuators'
  container-title: IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics
  page: 1485-1497
  volume: '18'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: This paper presents the complete development and analysis of a soft robotic
    platform that exhibits peristaltic locomotion. The design principle is based on
    the antagonistic arrangement of circular and longitudinal muscle groups of Oligochaetes.
    Sequential antagonistic motion is achieved in a flexible braided mesh-tube structure
    using a nickel titanium (NiTi) coil actuators wrapped in a spiral pattern around
    the circumference. An enhanced theoretical model of the NiTi coil spring describes
    the combination of martensite deformation and spring elasticity as a function
    of geometry. A numerical model of the mesh structures reveals how peristaltic
    actuation induces robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction
    of circumferential NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled,
    tested, and compared on the basis of speed. Utilizing additional NiTi coils placed
    longitudinally, steering capabilities are incorporated. Proprioceptive potentiometers
    sense segment contraction, which enables the development of closed-loop controllers.
    Several appropriate control algorithms are designed and experimentally compared
    based on locomotion speed and energy consumption. The entire mechanical structure
    is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand significant external impact
    during operation. This approach allows a completely soft robotic platform by employing
    a flexible control unit and energy sources.

  abstract: Fossil bird skeletons discovered in Lower Cretaceous lake deposits in
    China shed new light on the early evolution of avian flight and perching. The
    135 million-year-old sparrow-sized skeletons represent a new avian, Sinornis santensis,
    n. gen. n. sp., that preserves striking primitive features such as a flexible
    manus with unguals, a footed pubis, and stomach ribs (gastralia). In contrast
    to Archaeoperyx, however, Sinornis exhibits advanced features such as a broad
    sternum, wing-folding mechanism, pygostyle, and large fully reversed hallux. Modern
    avian flight function and perching capability, therefore, must have evolved in
    small-bodied birds in inland habitats not long after Archaeopteryx.

  page: 237-252
  volume: '24'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Several physico-mechanical designs evolved in fish are currently inspiring
    robotic devices for propulsion and maneuvering purposes in underwater vehicles.
    Considering the potential benefits involved, this paper presents an overview of
    the swimming mechanisms employed by fish. The motivation is to provide a relevant
    and useful introduction to the existing literature for engineers with an interest
    in the emerging area of aquatic biomechanisms. The fish swimming types are presented,
    following the well-established classification scheme and nomenclature originally
    proposed by Breder. Fish swim either by body and/or caudal fin (BCF) movements
    or using median and/or paired fin (MPF) propulsion. The latter is generally employed
    at slow speeds, offering greater maneuverability and better propulsive efficiency,
    while BCF movements can achieve greater thrust and accelerations. For both BCF
    and MPF locomotion, specific swimming modes are identified, based on the propulsor
    and the type of movements (oscillatory or undulatory) employed for thrust generation.
    Along with general descriptions and kinematic data, the analytical approaches
    developed to study each swimming mode are also introduced. Particular reference
    is made to lunate tail propulsion, undulating fins, and labriform (oscillatory
    pectoral fin) swimming mechanisms, identified as having the greatest potential
    for exploitation in artificial systems.

  issue: '3'
  abstract: This article presents the development of a multiple robotic fish cooperation
    platform, which is established by employing a group of radio-controlled, multi-link
    fish-like robots. This work is inspired by the observation from nature that the
    capability of one single fish is limited, as in order to survive the atrocious
    circumstances in the sea, fish often swim in schools. The analogical situations
    occur in the robotic fish case. In engineering applications, most missions are
    so complex that they must be accomplished by effective cooperation of multiple
    fish robots. The platform presented in this article, as a novel test bed for multiple
    robotic fish cooperation, can be applied to different types of complex tasks.
    More importantly, it provides a good platform to test and verify all kinds of
    algorithms and strategies for cooperation of multiple underwater mobile robots.
    We use two cooperative tasks as examples to heuristically demonstrate the performance
    of this platform. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\]; Copyright of International Journal of

  abstract: The direct-forcing fictitious domain method is extended to simulate the
    locomotion of a passively pitching foil. Our study focuses on the hysteresis phenomenon
    that the critical frequency for the reverse of the locomotion direction of the
    wing in case of decreasing frequency is smaller than that in case of increasing
    frequency. In our simulations, the hysteresis phenomenon is produced by imposing
    different initial conditions at a same frequency. Our results indicate that the
    ratio of the heaving amplitudes of two foil edges is crucial to the direction
    of the foil’s horizontal motion, and the amplitude of the leading edge is generally
    smaller. The critical frequencies for the reverse of the locomotion direction
    are increased, when the foil-fluid density ratio is decreased or the spring constant
    is increased. The critical frequencies in the bi-stability regime also depend
    on the initial velocity imposed, and the hysteresis loop generally becomes larger
    if the initial velocities are closer to the terminal locomotion velocities of
    the foil.

  abstract: This article explores a technique to leverage curved surfaces for producing
    preferential buckling that can be used to create forward thrust in flapping-wing
    devices. We present a novel concept for using anisotropically buckling beams in
    robot locomotion, facilitated via an analytical and finite-element-based analyses.
    We demonstrate that with symmetric flapping inputs from a motor, buckling beams
    can be used to generate forward thrust, power, and work while reducing the drag
    associated with the recovery phase of the flapping gait. Our analysis includes
    experimental data that measures the forces produced by wings flapping in air and
    water. The results show a clear difference in the work produced between buckling
    and nonbuckling curved beams and shows that the average force and work produced
    by buckling wings over a number of cycles with symmetric flapping is nonzero.
    This has been demonstrated on a new, two-fin swimming robot that, through the
    use of this phenomenon, is capable of reaching an average speed of 0.1 m/s. This
    article makes it possible for simple motor inputs to produce complex swimming
    gaits through careful consideration during the mechanical design phase for swimming
    robots.

  abstract: This paper evaluates how laminated techniques may be used to replicate
    the performance of more traditionally manufactured robotic manipulators. In this
    case study, we introduce a laminated 2-DOF spherical, parallel manipulator. Taking
    advantage of laminating techniques in the construction of the robot can result
    in considerable saving in construction costs and time, but, the challenges caused
    by this technique have to be addressed. By using stiffer materials in rigid links,
    the rigidity of the robot is increased to an acceptable level. We discuss one
    method for compensating position uncertainty via an experimental identification
    technique which uses a neural network to create a forward kinematic model. Final
    results show that the proposed mechanism is able to track desired rotation with
    acceptable precision using open-loop model-based control. This indicates that
    parallel manipulators fabricated using lamination techniques can provide similar
    performance with prototypes made in conventional methods.

  abstract: Many different robots have been designed and built to work under water.
    In many cases, researchers have chosen to use bio-inspired platforms. In most
    cases, the main goal of the fish inspired robots has been set to autonomously
    swim and maneuver in an environment spacious compared to the fish’s size. In this
    paper, the identification & control of a low-cost fish-inspired robot is studied
    with goal of building a mechanism to not only swim in water but able to interact
    with its narrow environment. The robotic fish under study uses tail propulsion
    as main loco-motion. Moreover, proper propulsion regimes are identified and used
    to model and control thrust generated by propulsion.

  abstract: In this study, soft hydrogel crawlers with remote magnetic-responsive
    motility in confined spaces have been developed. Inspired by the motion of maggots,
    the hydrogel crawlers can reversibly contract and elongate their body controlled
    by repeatedly switching on/off an alternating magnetic field. Based on the cyclic
    deformation, the hydrogel crawlers can move peristaltically in a confined space
    that is coated with asymmetric micro-patterns. The dependence of the hydrogel
    motility on the pattern structures and lubrication is characterized using experimental
    measurements. Such a hydrogel system pioneers the study of active motile systems
    in porous media and has the potential to impact the fields of targeted drug delivery
    and active actuators.

  abstract: Multibody software designed for mechanical engineering has been successfully
    employed in biomedical research for many years. For real time operation some biomedical
    researchers have also adapted game physics engines. However, these tools were
    built for other purposes and do not fully address the needs of biomedical researchers
    using them to analyze the dynamics of biological structures and make clinically
    meaningful recommendations. We are addressing this problem through the development
    of an open source, extensible, high performance toolkit including a multibody
    mechanics library aimed at the needs of biomedical researchers. The resulting
    code, Simbody, supports research in a variety of fields including neuromuscular,
    prosthetic, and biomolecular simulation, and related research such as biologically-inspired
    design and control of humanoid robots and avatars. Simbody is the dynamics engine
    behind OpenSim, a widely used biomechanics simulation application. This article
    reviews issues that arise uniquely in biomedical research, and reports on the
    architecture, theory, and computational methods Simbody uses to address them.
    By addressing these needs explicitly Simbody provides a better match to the needs
    of researchers than can be obtained by adaptation of mechanical engineering or
    gaming codes. Simbody is a community resource, free for any purpose. We encourage
    wide adoption and invite contributions to the code base at https://simtk.org/home/simbody.

  abstract: Novel near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/graphene
    oxide (PNIPAM-GO) nanocomposite hydrogels with ultrahigh tensibility are prepared
    by incorporating sparse chemical cross-linking of small molecules with physical
    cross-linking of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Combination of the GO nanosheets
    and thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) polymeric networks provides
    the hydrogels with an excellent NIR light-responsive property. The ultrahigh tensibility
    of PNIPAM-GO nanocomposite hydrogels is achieved by simply using a very low concentration
    of N,N’-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS) molecules as chemical cross-linkers to
    generate a relatively homogeneous structure with flexible long polymer chains
    and rare chemically cross-linked dense clusters. Moreover, the oxidized groups
    of GO nanosheets enable the formation of a hydrogen bond interaction with the
    amide groups of PNIPAM chains, which could physically cross-link the PNIPAM chains
    to increase the toughness of the hydrogel networks. The prepared PNIPAM-GO nanocomposite
    hydrogels with ultrahigh tensibility exhibit rapid, reversible, and repeatable
    NIR light-responsive properties, which are highly promising for fabricating remote
    light-controlled devices, smart actuators, artificial muscles, and so on.

  abstract: Recently, there has been strong interest in printed robots and paper electronics.
    Printing is an adequate manufacturing method for the mass production; robots manufactured
    by printing can be low cost, rapidly creatable and easy to design. Paper is one
    of smart materials with high water absorbency and strength; it is easily mass-produced
    at low cost. Many inexpensive and flexible devices were created in paper electronics.
    Therefore, we propose paper mechatronics that merges printed robots and paper
    electronics. We used a commercial ink jet printer with water-based ink for self-folding
    of paper; the paper was folded automatically along the printed line to make the
    robot body. The paper robot was equipped with a printed electrothermal actuator
    that consists of epoxy resin covered by conductive ink. The epoxy resin was heated
    by Joule heat of the conductive ink under a driving voltage of 8 V. The self-folding
    of experimental paper robot took 15 minutes to construct the body and the robot
    demonstrated a locomotion at 6.5 mm per step.

  abstract: 'Self-assembled structures and machines can be made using origami-inspired
    manufacturing methods. In particular, self-folding of two-dimensional materials
    using shape memory polymers and embedded electrical circuits has been utilized
    to build robots and structures in an inexpensive and rapid manner. In order to

    three types of self-folding sensors: a mechanical switch, a capacitive contact
    sensor, and a velocity sensor. We utilize specialized fold patterns to create
    cyclic mechanical linkages as well as additional composite layers such as magnetic
    sheets to build these sensors. We demonstrate the integration of two of these
    sensors, the switch and the contact sensor, into a lamp that can self-fold and
    immediately begin responding to its surroundings.'

  abstract: 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. To create life-like movements,
    living muscle actuator technologies have borrowed inspiration from biomimetic
    concepts in developing bioinspired robots. Here, the development of a bioinspired
    soft robotics system, with integrated self-actuating cardiac muscles on a hierarchically
    structured scaffold with flexible gold microelectrodes is reported. Inspired by
    the movement of living organisms, a batoid-fish-shaped substrate is designed and
    reported, which is composed of two micropatterned hydrogel layers. The first layer
    is a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel substrate, which provides a mechanically stable
    structure for the robot, followed by a layer of gelatin methacryloyl embedded
    with carbon nanotubes, which serves as a cell culture substrate, to create the
    actuation component for the soft body robot. In addition, flexible Au microelectrodes
    are embedded into the biomimetic scaffold, which not only enhance the mechanical
    integrity of the device, but also increase its electrical conductivity. After
    culturing and maturation of cardiomyocytes on the biomimetic scaffold, they show
    excellent myofiber organization and provide self-actuating motions aligned with
    the direction of the contractile force of the cells. The Au microelectrodes placed
    below the cell layer further provide localized electrical stimulation and control
    of the beating behavior of the bioinspired soft robot.

  page: 192-215
  volume: '30'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: 'A motion planning algorithm is described for bounding over rough terrain
    with the LittleDog robot. Unlike walking gaits, bounding is highly dynamic and
    cannot be planned with quasi-steady approximations. LittleDog is modeled as a
    planar five-link system, with a 16-dimensional state space; computing a plan over
    rough terrain in this high-dimensional state space that respects the kinodynamic
    constraints due to underactuation and motor limits is extremely challenging. Rapidly
    Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are known for fast kinematic path planning in high-dimensional
    configuration spaces in the presence of obstacles, but search efficiency degrades
    rapidly with the addition of challenging dynamics. A computationally tractable
    planner for bounding was developed by modifying the RRT algorithm by using: (1)
    motion primitives to reduce the dimensionality of the problem; (2) Reachability
    Guidance, which dynamically changes the sampling distribution and distance metric
    to address differential constraints and discontinuous motion primitive dynamics;
    and (3) sampling with a Voronoi bias in a lower-dimensional “task space” for bounding.
    Short trajectories were demonstrated to work on the robot, however open-loop bounding
    is inherently unstable. A feedback controller based on transverse linearization
    was implemented, and shown in simulation to stabilize perturbations in the presence
    of noise and time delays.'

  container-title: Science (New York, N.Y.)
  page: 647-50
  volume: '345'
  issue: '6197'
  abstract: Although broadly admired for its aesthetic qualities, the art of origami
    is now being recognized also as a framework for mechanical metamaterial design.
    Working with the Miura-ori tessellation, we find that each unit cell of this crease
    pattern is mechanically bistable, and by switching between states, the compressive
    modulus of the overall structure can be rationally and reversibly tuned. By virtue
    of their interactions, these mechanically stable lattice defects also lead to
    emergent crystallographic structures such as vacancies, dislocations, and grain
    boundaries. Each of these structures comes from an arrangement of reversible folds,
    highlighting a connection between mechanical metamaterials and programmable matter.
    Given origami’s scale-free geometric character, this framework for metamaterial
    design can be directly transferred to milli-, micro-, and nanometer-size systems.

  abstract: The use of statistical techniques to build approximations of expensive
    computer analysis codes pervades much of today’s engineering design. These statistical
    approximations, or metamodels, are used to replace the actual expensive computer
    analyses, facilitating multidisciplinary, multiobjective optimization and concept
    exploration. In this paper, we review several of these techniques, including design
    of experiments, response surface methodology, Taguchi methods, neural networks,
    inductive learning and kriging. We survey their existing application in engineering
    design, and then address the dangers of applying traditional statistical techniques
    to approximate deterministic computer analysis codes. We conclude with recommendations
    for the appropriate use of statistical approximation techniques in given situations,
    and how common pitfalls can be avoided.

  volume: Doctor of
  genre: PhD thesis
  abstract: 'This thesis describes an approach to synthesizing plans for robotic excavators.
    Excava- tion tasks range from loading a pile of soil to cutting a geometrically
    described volume of earth— for a trench or foundation footing. The excavation
    task can be stated in terms famil- iar to researchers in robotics and artificial
    intelligence: Transform the world from its current state to another state. Two
    important characteristics, however, distinguish the excavation domain. First,
    soil is deformable, and, hence, a complete state-space description of terrain
    to be excavated requires a high-dimensional representation. But, for the state-based
    represen- tations that traditional planners use, very large spaces are simply
    infeasible. Second, the response of soil varies immensely, and in general, it
    is not possible to analytically describe the mechanics of soil motion and its
    interaction with tools. A soil’s shear strength depends not only on its physical
    and chemical makeup, but also on factors such as the compaction experienced in
    the past. Thus a robotic excavator is forced to deal with approximate and incomplete
    models of its actions and their results. This research has developed and demonstrated
    a unified approach to deal with each of these issues. Instead of posing the planning
    problem in state space, this thesis employs a dual representation called “action
    space.” An action space is spanned by parameters that abstract the actions that
    a robot excavator might perform. This formulation allows posing an excavation
    task as a problem of constrained optimization over the space of prototypical,
    one- step excavating plans. To reason about resistive forces encountered while
    digging, this work has developed a method that learns to predict resistive forces
    encountered during excava- tion. The action space representation allows incorporating
    goal configuration and geometric and force constraints within a single framework.
    Planning is thus reduced to finding a sub- set of plans that meet the constraints
    and optimize an appropriate performance measure. Over 400 experiments were conducted
    on a specially-developed testbed to validate the action-space/force-prediction
    approach. The testbed robot has a hydraulically manipulated shovel and sensors
    that measure both contact forces and terrain contour. Given a geometric specification,
    the current implementation can excavate a trench to predictable tolerances. Testbed
    results reinforce the notion that a force-based model is essential to successful
    robotic excavation. These findings also point to the necessity of a lower-level
    control mode that can modify excavation plans based on the nature of the terrain
    encountered.'

  abstract: Recent research in computer vision has increasingly focused on building

    providing advanced interfaces for interacting with humans, and creating sensible
    models of humans for various purposes. This paper presents a new algorithm for
    detecting moving objects from a static background scene based on frame difference.
    Firstly, the first frame is captured through the static camera and after that
    sequence of frames is captured at regular intervals. Secondly, the absolute difference
    is calculated between the consecutive frames and the difference image is stored
    in the system. Thirdly, the difference image is converted into gray image and
    then translated into binary image. Finally, morphological filtering is done to
    remove noise.

  abstract: This paper presents the design of a novel robot capable of climbing on
    vertical and rough surfaces, such as stucco walls. Termed CLIBO (claw inspired
    robot), the robot can remain in position for a long period of time. Such a capability
    offers important civilian and military advantages such as surveillance, observation,
    search and rescue and even for entertainment and games. The robot’s kinematics
    and motion, is a combination between mimicking a technique commonly used in rock
    climbing using four limbs to climb and a method used by cats to climb on trees
    with their claws. It uses four legs, each with four-degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF)
    and specially designed claws attached to each leg that enable it to maneuver itself
    up the wall and to move in any direction. At the tip of each leg is a gripping
    device made of 12 fishing hooks and aligned in such a way that each hook can move
    independently on the wall’s surface. This design has the advantage of not requiring
    a tail-like structure that would press against the surface to balance its weight.
    A locomotion algorithm was developed to provide the robot with an autonomous capability
    for climbing along the pre-designed route. The algorithm takes into account the
    kinematics of the robot and the contact forces applied on the foot pads. In addition,
    the design provides the robot with the ability to review its gripping strength
    in order to achieve and maintain a high degree of reliability in its attachment
    to the wall. An experimental robot was built to validate the model and its motion
    algorithm. Experiments demonstrate the high reliability of the special gripping
    device and the efficiency of the motion planning algorithm. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract: A four-bar mechanism with two flexible links is proposed to be used in
    a micromechanical flying insect robot wing thorax design for stroke amplification.
    PZT-5H and PZN-PT based unimorph actuators are utilized at the input link of the
    four-bar. The kinematics and dynamics of the proposed wing structure with two
    parallel four-bar mechanisms are analyzed, and DC forces generated at the wing
    are computed for checking the feasibility of the design. Using laser micromachining
    and folding techniques, prototype four-bars are constructed, and it is shown that
    the single four-bar structure can have 90-100&deg; stroke motion at 29 Hz with
    a rigid polyester wing on it.

    the mechanics of movement and of posture.</span>
  container-title: The Quarterly journal of microscopical science
  publisher: The Company of Biologists Ltd
  page: 1-14
  volume: '88'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: '1\. An account is given of the muscular anatomy of the foot and ampulla
    of Asterias rubens. An intrinsic musculature of the sucker figured by Cuénot (1891)
    and Chadwick (1923) is shown not to be present; on the other hand, postural muscles
    responsible for orientating the podium, levator fibres which ‘cup’ the sucker,
    and radial fibres which flatten it are described and figured for the first time.
    2. The role of the different muscle systems, the collagen connective tissue, and
    the fluid of the hydrocoel in protracting and retracting the foot, and in effecting
    the attachment and detachment of the sucker, is discussed. 3. Evidence is presented,
    to show that postural pointing of the foot is brought about by the contraction
    of a ring of muscles encircling the base of the podium. The orienting muscles
    are functionally, but not anatomically, distinct from the longitudinal fibres
    of the retractor sheath. 4. The ambulatory step is shown to comprise a series
    of linked phases of static posture and of movement. Each phase is characterized
    by the contraction of one member of each of the two opposing pairs of muscles
    engaged in the development of the step. The two pairs of muscles are (1) the anterior
    and posterior orienting fibres, and (2) the protractors and retractors of the
    foot. In its ideal form the step comprises four phases of static posture alternating
    with four movements. Each movement is ushered in by a reversal of the contraction-relaxation
    relationships of one of the two pairs of opposing muscle systems. Four such changes
    are possible and they occur in a sequence that ensures the orderly succession
    of the four movements of protraction, swing back, retraction, and swing forward,
    of which movements the idealized stepping cycle is composed. 5. The actual locomotory
    step departs from the ideal form in two respects: (1) it is liable to become disrupted
    by a delay in the initiation of the protraction or of the backswing movement,
    and (2) withdrawal of the podium occurs simultaneously with its re-orientation
    in the forward direction. It is pointed out that these variations are explicable
    on the assumption that, in the two series of opposing muscle pairs, the retractor
    fibres are more readily excited to contract than are their antagonists, and the
    anterior postural muscles than the posterior postural fibres.'

  abstract: Skin-like sensitivity, or the capability to recognize tactile information,
    will be an essential feature of future generations of robots, enabling them to
    operate in unstructured environments. Recently developed large-area pressure sensors
    made with organic transistors have been proposed for electronic artificial skin
    (E-skin) applications. These sensors are bendable down to a 2-mm radius, a size
    that is sufficiently small for the fabrication of human-sized robot fingers. Natural
    human skin, however, is far more complex than the transistor-based imitations
    demonstrated so far. It performs other functions, including thermal sensing. Furthermore,
    without conformability, the application of E-skin on three-dimensional surfaces
    is impossible. In this work, we have successfully developed conformable, flexible,
    large-area networks of thermal and pressure sensors based on an organic semiconductor.
    A plastic film with organic transistor-based electronic circuits is processed
    to form a net-shaped structure, which allows the E-skin films to be extended by

  abstract: It is now widely accepted that skin sensitivity will be very important
    for future robots used by humans in daily life for housekeeping and entertainment
    purposes. Despite this fact, relatively little progress has been made in the field
    of pressure recognition compared to the areas of sight and voice recognition,
    mainly because good artificial "electronic skin" with a large area and mechanical
    flexibility is not yet available. The fabrication of a sensitive skin consisting
    of thousands of pressure sensors would require a flexible switching matrix that
    cannot be realized with present silicon-based electronics. Organic field-effect
    transistors can substitute for such conventional electronics because organic circuits
    are inherently flexible and potentially ultralow in cost even for a large area.
    Thus, integration of organic transistors and rubber pressure sensors, both of
    which can be produced by low-cost processing technology such as large-area printing
    technology, will provide an ideal solution to realize a practical artificial skin,
    whose feasibility has been demonstrated in this paper. Pressure images have been
    taken by flexible active matrix drivers with organic transistors whose mobility
    reaches as high as 1.4 cm(2)/V.s. The device is electrically functional even when
    it is wrapped around a cylindrical bar with a 2-mm radius.

  volume: '3'
  abstract: This paper presents initial results in integrating touch with vision for
    delicate manipulation tasks. A generalizable framework of behavioral primitives
    for tactile and visual feedback control is proposed. Since vision provides position
    and shape information at a distance, while tactile provides small-scale geometric
    and force information, we focus on the complimentary roles of vision and touch.
    We demonstrate that visual feedback can perform the rough positioning needed for
    tactile sensor feedback, and that grasp force and object orientation can be sensed
    and controlled with tactile sensing. A force sensor based approach provides a
    comparison measure, and we observe that the use of tactile sensing results in
    a more gentle grasp.

  abstract: The ability to visualize in three dimensions is a cognitive skill that
    has been shown to be important for success in engineering and other technological
    fields. For engineering, the ability to mentally rotate 3-D objects is especially
    important. Unfortunately, of all the cognitive skills, 3-D rotation abilities
    exhibit robust gender differences, favoring males. The assessment of 3-D spatial
    skill and associated gender differences has been a topic of educational research
    for nearly a century; however, a great deal of the previous work has been aimed
    at merely identifying differences. The author has been conducting applied research
    in the area of spatial skills development for more than a decade aimed at identifying
    proctical methods for improving 3-D spatial skills, especially for women engineering
    students. This paper details the significant findings obtained over the past several

  abstract: Terrestrial arthropods negotiate demanding terrain more effectively than
    any search-and-rescue robot. Slow, precise stepping using distributed neural feedback
    is one strategy for dealing with challenging terrain. Alternatively, arthropods
    could simplify control on demanding surfaces by rapid running that uses kinetic
    energy to bridge gaps between footholds. We demonstrate that this is achieved
    using distributed mechanical feedback, resulting from passive contacts along legs
    positioned by pre-programmed trajectories favorable to their attachment mechanisms.
    We used wire-mesh experimental surfaces to determine how a decrease in foothold
    probability affects speed and stability. Spiders and insects attained high running
    speeds on simulated terrain with 90

  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 1907-1920
  volume: '213'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: In nature, cockroaches run rapidly over complex terrain such as leaf litter.
    These substrates are rarely rigid, and are frequently very compliant. Whether
    and how compliant surfaces change the dynamics of rapid insect locomotion has
    not been investigated to date largely due to experimental limitations. We tested
    the hypothesis that a running insect can maintain average forward speed over an
    extremely soft elastic surface (10 N m(-1)) equal to 2/3 of its virtual leg stiffness
    (15 N m(-1)). Cockroaches Blaberus discoidalis were able to maintain forward speed
    (mean +/- s.e.m., 37.2+/-0.6 cm s(-1) rigid surface versus 38.0+/-0.7 cm s(-1)
    elastic surface; repeated-measures ANOVA, P=0.45). Step frequency was unchanged
    (24.5+/-0.6 steps s(-1) rigid surface versus 24.7+/-0.4 steps s(-1) elastic surface;
    P=0.54). To uncover the mechanism, we measured the animal’s centre of mass (COM)
    dynamics using a novel accelerometer backpack, attached very near the COM. Vertical
    acceleration of the COM on the elastic surface had a smaller peak-to-peak amplitude
    (11.50+/-0.33 m s(-2), rigid versus 7.7+/-0.14 m s(-2), elastic; P=0.04). The
    observed change in COM acceleration over an elastic surface required no change
    in effective stiffness when duty factor and ground stiffness were taken into account.
    Lowering of the COM towards the elastic surface caused the swing legs to land
    earlier, increasing the period of double support. A feedforward control model
    was consistent with the experimental results and provided one plausible, simple
    explanation of the mechanism.

  volume: '25'
  issue: 4-5
  abstract: This paper presents an integrated, systems-level view of several novel
    design and control features associated with the biologically inspired, hexapedal,
    RiSE (Robots in Scansorial Environments) robot. RiSE is the first legged machine
    capable of locomotion on both the ground and a variety of vertical building surfaces
    including brick, stucco, and crushed stone at speeds up to 4 cm/s, quietly and
    without the use of suction, magnets, or adhesives. It achieves these capabilities
    through a combination of bioinspired and traditional design methods. This paper
    describes the design process and specifically addresses body morphology, hierarchical
    compliance in the legs and feet, and sensing and control systems that enable robust
    and reliable climbing on difficult surfaces. Experimental results illustrate the
    effects of various behaviors on climbing performance and demonstrate the robot’s
    ability to climb reliably for long distances. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Robotics
  page: 65-74
  volume: '24'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Stickybot is a bioinspired robot that climbs smooth vertical surfaces
    such as glass, plastic, and ceramic tile at 4 cm/s. The robot employs several
    design principles adapted from the gecko including a hierarchy of compliant structures,
    directional adhesion, and control of tangential contact forces to achieve control
    of adhesion. We describe the design and fabrication methods used to create underactuated,
    multimaterial structures that conform to surfaces over a range of length scales
    from centimeters to micrometers. At the finest scale, the undersides of Stickybot’s
    toes are covered with arrays of small, angled polymer stalks. Like the directional
    adhesive structures used by geckos, they readily adhere when pulled tangentially
    from the tips of the toes toward the ankles; when pulled in the opposite direction,
    they release. Working in combination with the compliant structures and directional
    adhesion is a force control strategy that balances forces among the feet and promotes
    smooth attachment and detachment of the toes.

  publisher: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  page: 1-195
  genre: PhD thesis
  abstract: We describe a program called SketchIT capable of producing multiple families
    of designs from a single sketch. The program is given a rough sketch (drawn using
    line segments for part faces and icons for springs and kinematic joints) and a
    description of the desired behavior. The sketch is "rough" in the sense that taken
    literally, it mat not work. From this single, perhaps flawed sketch and the behavior
    description, the program produces an entire family of working designs. The program
    also produces design variants, each of which is itself a family of designs. SketchIT
    represents each family of designs with a "behavior ensuring parametric model"
    (BEP-Model), a parametric model augmented with a set of constraints that ensure
    the geometry provides the desired behavior. The construction of the BEP-Model
    from the sketch and behavior description is the primary task and source of difficulty
    in this undertaking. SketchIT begins by abstracting the sketch to produce a qualitative
    configuration space (qc-space) which it then uses as its primary representation
    of behavior. SketchIT modifies this initial qc-space until qualitative simulation
    verifies that it produces the desired behavior. SketchIT’s task is then to find
    geometries that implement this qc-space. It does this using a library of qc-space
    fragments. Each fragment is a piece of parametric geometry with a set of constraints
    that ensure the geometry implements a specific kind of boundary (qcs-curve) in
    qc-space. SketchIT assembles the fragments to produce the BEP-Model. SketchIT
    produces design variants by mapping the qc-space to multiple implementations,
    and by trasforming rotating parts to translating parts and vice versa.

  abstract: Contrary to previously held notions, recent psychological experiments
    suggest that the human tactile system is both a fast and accurate recognition
    device for real objects. It seems reasonable, then, to build a robotic tactile
    perception system for the purpose of object identification. Toward this end, we
    present a set of low level tactile primitives and the exploratory and analytic
    procedures used to identify and extract them. We then discuss how these primitives
    may be combined into tactile features and, finally, how these features might be
    utilized by the robot perceptual system as a whole.

  abstract: 'The use of 3D printing has rapidly expanded in the past couple of years.
    It is now possible to produce 3D-printed objects with exceptionally high fidelity
    and precision. However, although the quality of 3D printing has improved, both
    the time to print and the material costs have remained high. Moreover, there is
    no guarantee that a printed model is structurally sound. The printed product often
    does not survive cleaning, transportation, or handling, or it may even collapse
    under its own weight. We present a system that addresses this issue by providing
    automatic detection and correction of the problematic cases. The structural problems
    are detected by combining a lightweight structural analysis solver with 3D medial
    axis approximations. After areas with high structural stress are found, the model
    is corrected by combining three approaches: hollowing, thickening, and strut insertion.
    Both detection and correction steps are repeated until the problems have been

  abstract: Algorithms for dextrous robot grasping always have to cope with the challenge
    of achieving high object specialisation for a wide range of grasping contexts.
    In this paper, we present a tactile-driven approach that dynamically uses the
    robot’s grasping experience to address this issue. During the grasp movement,
    the current contact information is used to dynamically adapt the grasping control
    by targeting the best matching posture from the experience base. Thus, the robot
    recalls and actuates a grasp it already successfully performed in a similar tactile
    context. To efficiently represent the experience, we introduce the grasp manifold
    assuming that grasp postures form a smooth manifold in hand posture space. We
    present a simple way of providing approximations of grasp manifolds using self-organising
    maps (SOMs). The algorithm is evaluated on three different geometry primitives
    - box, cylinder and sphere - in a physics-based computer simulation.

    functions with a finite number of discontinuities</span>
  page: 1-27
  abstract: A simple and very accurate method to approximate a function with a finite
    number of discontinuities is presented. This method relies on hyperbolic tangent
    functions of rational arguments as connecting functions at the discontinuities,
    each argument being the reciprocal of Newton binomials that depend on the abscissae
    that define the domain of the discontinuous function and upon the abscissae of
    discontinuities. Our approximants take the form of linear combinations of such
    hyperbolic tangent functions with coefficients that are obtained by solving a
    linear system of inhomogeneous equations whose righthand sides are the partition
    functions that define the given discontinuous function. These approximants are
    analytic, and being free from the Gibbs phenomenon certainly converge at the discontinuity
    points much better than other known approximants to discontinuous functions, typical
    relative errors being of the order of 10-14 even when as close as 10-12 to the
    discontinuity points. Moreover, they can be readily scaled to larger intervals.
    Our method is here illustrated with a representative set of discontinuous mathematical
    physics functions, and by studying the dynamics of an oscillator subjected to
    a discontinuous force, but it can be applied to important cases of discontinuous
    functions in physics, mathematics, engineering and physical chemistry.

    in mines, quarries, and construction sites. The automation of these machines offers
    promise for increasing productivity and improving safety. To date, most research
    in this area has focused on selected parts of the problem. In this paper we present
    a system that completely automates the truck loading task. The excavator uses
    two scanning laser rangefinders to recognize and localize the truck, measure the
    soil face, and detect obstacles. The excavator’s software decides where to dig
    in the soil, where to dump in the truck, and how to quickly move between these
    points while detecting and stopping for obstacles. The system was fully implemented
    and was demonstrated to load trucks as fast as human operators

  abstract: This paper presents a model-based method, called Dynamic Balance Force
    Control (DBFC), for determining full body joint torques based on desired COM motion
    and contact forces for compliant humanoid robots. The center of mass (COM) dynamics
    are affected directly through contact force control to achieve stable balance.
    This idea is used to formulate DBFC considering the full rigid-body dynamics of
    the robot to produce desired contact forces. To achieve generic force control
    tasks, a virtual model controller, DBFC-VMC, is presented. Results presented from
    experiments on a force-controlled humanoid robot and simulation demonstrate the
    general purpose use of this control.

  abstract: 'Functionally graded materials (FGMs) gradually change composition throughout
    their volume, allowing for areas of a part to be optimized for specific performance
    requirements. While additive manufacturing (AM) process types such as material
    jetting and directed energy deposition are capable of creating FGMs, design guidelines
    for varying the material composition in an FGM do not exist. This article presents
    a novel design solution for FGMs: creating the material gradient by varying the
    mesostructural size and thickness of bicontinuous, multi-material geometries.
    By using a bicontinuous structure, such as Schoen’s gyroid surface or Schwarz’s
    P and D surfaces, each component material exists as a continuous discrete structure,
    which allows FGMs to be fabricated by a wider range of AM processes. The gradient
    is created by varying the volume fraction occupied by the surface structure inside
    the part volume. This article explores the use of this technique to create FGMs
    with material extrusion AM. Properties of these bicontinuous structures are experimentally
    characterized and shown to outperform typical material extrusion FGMs.'

  container-title: Bioinspiration and Biomimetics
  publisher: IOP Publishing
  page: 1-16
  volume: '10'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: We present a new mechanism for passive wing morphing of flapping wings
    inspired by bat and bird wing morphology. The mechanism consists of an unactuated
    hand wing connected to the arm wing with a wrist joint. Flapping motion generates
    centrifugal accelerations in the hand wing, forcing it to unfold passively. Using
    a robotic model in hover, we made kinematic measurements of unfolding kinematics
    as functions of the non-dimensional wingspan fold ratio (2–2.5) and flapping frequency
    (5–17 Hz) using stereo high-speed cameras. We find that the wings unfold passively
    within one to two flaps and remain unfolded with only small amplitude oscillations.
    To better understand the passive dynamics, we constructed a computer model of
    the unfolding process based on rigid body dynamics, contact models, and aerodynamic
    correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about
    one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced
    by flapping. The simulations also predict that relative unfolding time only weakly
    depends on flapping frequency and can be reduced to less than half a wingbeat
    by increasing flapping amplitude. Subsequent dimensional analysis shows that the
    time required to unfold passively is of the same order of magnitude as the flapping
    period. This suggests that centrifugal acceleration can drive passive unfolding
    within approximately one wingbeat in small and large wings. Finally, we show experimentally
    that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch, by first folding
    and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze
    through clutter without sophisticated control. Passive unfolding also provides
    a new avenue in morphing wing design that makes future flapping morphing wings
    possibly more energy efficient and light-weight. Simultaneously these results
    point to possible inertia driven, and therefore metabolically efficient, control
    strategies in bats and birds to morph or recover within a beat.

  page: 150-166
  volume: '36'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Underactuated, compliant, tendon-driven robotic hands are suited for deep-sea
    exploration. The robust Ocean One hand design utilizes elastic finger joints and
    a spring transmission to achieve a variety of pinch and wrap grasps. Compliance
    in the fingers and transmission determines the degree of load-sharing among contacts
    and the hands’ ability to secure irregularly shaped objects. However, it can also
    decrease external grasp stiffness and acquisition reliability. SimGrasp, a flexible
    dynamic hand simulator, enables parametric studies of the hand for acquisition
    and pull-out tests with varying transmission spring rates. In the present application,
    we take advantage of achieving different stiffnesses by reversing the direction
    of tendon windup using a torsional spring-loaded winch. With this provision, the
    hand can be relatively soft for handling delicate objects and stiff for tasks
    requiring strength. Two hands were field-tested as part of the Ocean One humanoid
    platform, which acquired a vase from the La Lune shipwreck site at a 91 m depth
    in the Mediterranean Sea.

  abstract: 'This paper gives an overview of the development of the field of Knowledge
    Engineering over the last 15 years. We discuss the paradigm shift from a transfer
    view to a modeling view and describe two approaches which considerably shaped
    research in Knowledge Engineering: Role-limiting Methods and Generic Tasks. To
    illustrate various concepts and methods which evolved in recent years we describe
    three modeling frameworks: CommonKADS, MIKE and PROTÉGÉ-II. This description is
    supplemented by discussing some important methodological developments in more
    detail: specification languages for knowledge-based systems, problem-solving methods
    and ontologies. We conclude by outlining the relationship of Knowledge Engineering
    to Software Engineering, Information Integration and Knowledge Management.'

    Upper Extremity Repetitive Therapy</span>'
  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering
  page: 336-346
  volume: '15'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: 'The structural design, control system, and integrated biofeedback for
    a wearable exoskeletal robot for upper extremity stroke rehabilitation are presented.
    Assisted with clinical evaluation, designers, engineers, and scientists have built
    a device for robotic assisted upper extremity repetitive therapy (RUPERT). Intense,
    repetitive physical rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial overcoming
    upper extremity deficits, but the therapy is labor intensive and expensive and
    difficult to evaluate quantitatively and objectively. The RUPERT is developed
    to provide a low cost, safe and easy-to-use, robotic-device to assist the patient
    and therapist to achieve more systematic therapy at home or in the clinic. The
    RUPERT has four actuated degrees-of-freedom driven by compliant and safe pneumatic
    muscles (PMs) on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. They are programmed to actuate
    the device to extend the arm and move the arm in 3-D space. It is very important
    to note that gravity is not compensated and the daily tasks are practiced in a
    natural setting. Because the device is wearable and lightweight to increase portability,
    it can be worn standing or sitting providing therapy tasks that better mimic activities
    of daily living. The sensors feed back position and force information for quantitative
    evaluation of task performance. The device can also provide real-time, objective
    assessment of functional improvement. We have tested the device on stroke survivors
    performing two critical activities of daily living (ADL): reaching out and self
    feeding. The future improvement of the device involves increased degrees-of-freedom
    and interactive control to adapt to a user’s physical conditions.'

    Point-to-Point Arm Movements</span>
  container-title: Current Biology
  page: 767-772
  volume: '16'
  issue: '8'
  abstract: One of the key problems in motor control is mastering or reducing the
    number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) through coordination \[1\]. This problem is
    especially prominent with hyper-redundant limbs such as the extremely flexible
    arm of the octopus \[2\]. Several strategies for simplifying these control problems
    have been suggested for human point-to-point arm movements \[3-6\]. Despite the
    evolutionary gap and morphological differences, humans and octopuses evolved similar
    strategies when fetching food to the mouth. To achieve this precise point-to-point-task,
    octopus arms generate a quasi-articulated structure based on three dynamic joints.
    A rotational movement around these joints brings the object to the mouth \[7\].
    Here, we describe a peripheral neural mechanism-two waves of muscle activation
    propagate toward each other, and their collision point sets the medial-joint location.
    This is a remarkably simple mechanism for adjusting the length of the segments
    according to where the object is grasped. Furthermore, similar to certain human
    arm movements, kinematic invariants were observed at the joint level rather than
    at the end-effector level, suggesting intrinsic control coordination. The evolutionary
    convergence to similar geometrical and kinematic features suggests that a kinematically
    constrained articulated limb controlled at the level of joint space is the optimal
    solution for precise point-to-point movements. 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  publisher: Institute of Electrical; Electronics Engineers Inc.
  page: 33-38
  volume: '0'
  abstract: Compliant actuator is widely accepted for physical human-robot interaction
    due to its safety aspect, dynamic performance improvements and energy saving abilities.
    In this paper, based on the variable ratio lever mechanism, a new kind of Serial
    Variable Stiffness Actuator (SVSA) is proposed by using an Archimedean Spiral
    Relocation Mechanism (ASRM) to change the position of the pivot, implementing
    large range of adjustable stiffness. The ASRM introduced here makes the SVSA design
    has continuous stiffness adjustment ability and simply mechanical structure. Within
    the Variable Stiffness Mechanism (VSM), two linear springs are assembled antagonistically
    on a spring shaft. Their displacements are perpendicular to the output link to
    transmit the spring force more efficiently. Stiffness modeling and analysis of
    the SVSA are carried out to cover large deflection angle. The physical implementation
    of the SVSA shows that the output stiffness of the VSM is changed from 1.72 to
    150.56 Nm/rad using a linear spring with stiffness 1882 N/m, working range covered
    from 0 to 360 °. Control experiments also proved the wide range of stiffness adjustment
    ability of the SVSA.

  container-title: Conference of the ieee industrial electronics society
  page: 245-250
  abstract: This paper proposes a simple tactile sensing and control method for robot
    to realize an active object surface recognition. The tactile sensor implemented
    on the robot hand consists of three force sensitive resistors with the peripheral
    circuits. The robot arm equipped with the sensor can perform active object recognition.
    Our research goal is to realize an effective robot controller for the 3D object
    handling. An additional final aim is to produce "artifacts" that is a kind of
    artificial creature, which enables to cooperate works between human and machine
    (robot) in a natural and intuitive manner. Throughout these works, we aim to realize
    a harmonized human-machine environment. The two examples of applications of the
    proposed tactile sensor are also introduced. First is a hand pose control to keep
    the moving direction normal to the object, which is often required in pushing
    an object for positioning. This application can be used for human-machine interaction
    tasks. Next is a hand pose and motion control for 3D-object edge tracing, which
    is required for industrial use such as welding machines and welding inspection.
    In these applications, we need no information about object shape or orientation
    in advance. We also show three experimental results using the proposed sensor
    unit. The system and results of experiments are presented.

  abstract: This paper shows a new design and prototyping method for a bending pneumatic

    design is based on optimal design using non-linear finite element method, in which
    geometrical and material non-linearity are considered and fabrication process
    is based on a rapid and efficient prototyping system using a CAD/CAM based rubber
    molding process. In this paper, the characteristics of several possible actuators
    are analyzed and evaluated to lead to an optimal actuator design. The actuator
    works very well with smooth and soft motion. The manta swimming robot in which
    the developed actuators are embedded is also designed based on non-linear finite
    element method. The developed manta swimming robot is made only of rubber and
    it swims in water smoothly as if it was a living fish. The experimental results
    of the manta robot motion show that good agreement with those of analytical results.

  abstract: This paper sums up lessons learned from a sequence of cooperative design
    workshops where end users were enabled to design mobile systems through scenario
    building, role playing, and low-fidelity prototyping. We present a resulting fixed
    workshop structure with well- chosen constraints that allows for end users to
    explore and design new technology and work practices. In these workshops, the
    systems developers get input to design from observing how users stage and act
    out current and future use scenarios and improvise new technology to fit their
    needs. A theoretical framework is presented to explain the creative processes
    involved and the workshop as a user- centered design method. Our findings encourage
    us to recommend the presented workshop structure for design projects involving
    mobility and computer-mediated communication, in particular project where the
    future use of the resulting products and services also needs to be designed.

    a new cyber– physical implementation that enables robotic fish to use real- time
    feedback to control their motion in response to live fish and other environmental
    features. Each robotic fish is magne- tically connected to, and thus moved by,
    a wheeled robot underneath the tank. Real-time image processing of a video stream
    from an overhead camera provides measurements of both the robotic fish and the
    live fish moving together in the tank. Feedback responses computed fromthesemeasurements
    are communicated to the robotic fish using Bluetooth.We show results of demonstrations
    and discuss possibilities that our im- plementation affords for new kinds of behavioral
    experiments with fish schools.

  abstract: 2014 IEEE. The proposed research effort explores the development of active
    cells - simple contractile electromechanical units that can be used as the material
    basis for larger articulable structures. Each cell, which might be considered
    a ’muscle unit’, consists of a contractile Nitinol SMA core with conductive terminals.
    Large numbers of these cells might be combined and externally powered to change
    phase, contracting to either articulate with a large strain or increase the stiffness
    of the ensemble, depending on the cell design. Unlike traditional work in modular
    robotics, the approach presented here focuses on cells that have a simplistic
    design and function, are inexpensive to fabricate, and are eventually scalable
    to sub-millimeter sizes, working towards our vision of robot structures that can
    be custom-fabricated from large numbers of general cell units, similar to biological
    structures.

  issue: '2'
  abstract: This paper presents the first practical method for "origamizing" or obtaining
    the folding pattern that folds a single sheet of material into a given polyhedral
    surface without any cut. The basic idea is to tuck fold a planar paper to form
    a three-dimensional shape. The main contribution is to solve the inverse problem;
    the input is an arbitrary polyhedral surface and the output is the folding pattern.
    Our approach is to convert this problem into a problem of laying out the polygons
    of the surface on a planar paper by introducing the concept of tucking molecules.
    We investigate the equality and inequality conditions required for constructing
    a valid crease pattern. We propose an algorithm based on two-step mapping and
    edge splitting to solve these conditions. The two-step mapping precalculates linear
    equalities and separates them from other conditions. This allows an interactive
    manipulation of the crease pattern in the system implementation. We present the
    first system for designing three-dimensional origami, enabling a user can interactively
    design complex spatial origami models that have not been realizable thus far.

  abstract: In this study, we show a family of multilayered rigid-foldable and flat-foldable
    vault structures. A vault can be designed by constructing a rigid-foldable curved
    folded tubular arch and assembling the arches to construct a multilayered surface.
    The resulting vault is also rigidly flat-foldable. We first show the process involved
    in the geometric construction of the tubular structure from a given space curve
    defined by curvature and torsion functions. Next, we show a single-DOF rigid-folding
    motion that is enabled by the curved folded tube. Finally, we show the parametric
    design of a vault structure and discuss its design parameters and the resulting
    form.

    Structures (IASS) Symposium 2009
  page: 2287-2294
  issue: October
  abstract: In general, a quadrilateral-mesh surface does not enable a continuous
    rigid motion because an overconstrained system, in which the number of constraints
    around degree-4 vertices (three for each vertex) exceeds the number of variables
    (the number of hinges), is constructed. However, it is known that the developable
    double corrugation surface, known as Miura-ori, produces a rigid deployment mechanism.
    The rigid-foldability of Miura-ori is due to the singularity in its pattern, where
    a single vertex is repeated. We generalize the geometric condition for enabling
    rigid motion in general quadrilateral-mesh origami without simple repeating symmetry.
    To ensure the existence of a finite motion, we derive the identity of functions
    from the formula for degree-4 single-vertex origami. This yields a variety of
    unexplored generalized shapes of quadrilateral-mesh origami that preserve one-DOF’finite
    rigid-foldability in addition to developability and flat-foldability.

  abstract: We propose a modeling method based on rationalizing curved folding in
    order to find the form variations of 1DOF origami mechanism. We interact with
    a physical paper model of curved folding and then discretize a curved folding
    by identifying and fixing the rulings. The discretized form is a rigid origami
    structure with at most one degree of freedom. The form adjustment follows the
    discretization so that it is sure to realize a mechanism. The workshop performed
    by the authors based on the proposed design method is reported. The objective
    of the workshop was to utilize the 1DOF characteristic of discretized curved folds
    as a constraint in the design of dynamic architectural components. The results
    showed the feasibility of the method and suggested a novel methodology for designing.

  abstract: 'The present paper describes an implementation of fast running motions
    involving a humanoid robot. Two important technologies are described: a motion
    generation and a balance control. The motion generation is a unified way to design
    both walking and running and can generate the trajectory with the vertical conditions
    of the Center Of Mass (COM) in short calculation time. The balance control enables
    a robot to maintain balance by changing the positions of the contact foot dynamically
    when the robot is disturbed. This control consists of 1) compliance control without
    force sensors, in which the joints are made compliant by feed-forward torques
    and adjustment of gains of position control, and 2) feedback control, which uses
    the measured orientation of the robot’s torso used in the motion generation as
    an initial condition to decide the foot positions. Finally, a human-sized humanoid
    robot that can run forward at 7.0 \[km/h\] is presented.'

  abstract: It is expected that variation of leg compliance, that is determined not
    only by joint compliance but by joint angle, contributes to provide multi-modal
    locomotion such as walking, jumping and running by single robot. This paper describes
    a design of bipedal robot and feed forward controller that realize multi-modal
    locomotion by tuning appropriate leg compliance on individual locomotion. In order
    to tune physical leg compliance, we adopt rotational joints driven by antagonistic
    McKibben pneumatic muscles. Experimental results show that proper leg compliance
    provided by joint compliance and leg posture achieves a walking from standing
    and a sequential jumping. These results suggest that tunable leg compliance is
    powerful mechanism for bipedal robot to provide human-like multi-modal locomotion.

  volume: '15'

  abstract: The origin of avian flight is one of the most controversial debates in
    Paleontology. This paper investigates the wing performance of Caudipteryx, the
    most basal non-volant dinosaur with pennaceous feathered forelimbs by using modal
    effective mass theory. From a mechanical standpoint, the forced vibrations excited
    by hindlimb locomotion stimulate the movement of wings, creating a flapping-like
    motion in response. This shows that the origin of the avian flight stroke should
    lie in a completely natural process of active locomotion on the ground. In this
    regard, flapping in the history of evolution of avian flight should have already
    occurred when the dinosaurs were equipped with pennaceous remiges and rectrices.
    The forced vibrations provided the initial training for flapping the feathered
    wings of theropods similar to Caudipteryx.

  abstract: This paper presents a novel method for estimating soil properties on-line
    during excavation tasks such as ground levelling, digging and sheet pilling. The
    proposed method computes key soil parameters by measuring the forces acting on
    the excavator bucket whilst being in contact with the soil and minimizing the
    error between measured forces and estimated forces produced by a real-time capable
    soil model. Two soil models, the Mohr-Coulomb soil model and the Chen and Liu
    upper bound soil model, are implemented and researched in the context of this
    estimation scheme. Parameter optimization is carried out employing the Newton
    Raphson method. The method is evaluated using experimental data and through comparison
    with an approach that makes use of graphical intersection for model optimization
    \[1\]. The results demonstrate that the proposed Newton Raphson-based method is
    as accurate as the graphical intersection-based approach, but up to 2000 times
    faster, and, thus, most suitable for on-line soil parameter estimation in an automated
    system which provides optimized digging trajectories for a given excavation task.

    robotic hands have the advantages of selfadaptive grasp and easy real-time control.
    In this paper, the development of a novel underactuated robotic hand is presented.
    This hand has five fingers and through using underactuation, the selfadaptability
    of each finger is achieved. This underactuated humanoid robotic hand can accomplish
    complicated selfadaptive grasp without high demand for real-time control system.
    In the first place, the design of a two degree-of-freedom underactuated finger
    is given. Then the parameters affecting the rotary angle and grasp force of the
    underactuated finger are analyzed and optimized. Finally, taking one finger as
    a module, the entire humanoid robotic hand is designed. This robotic hand is similar
    to human hand on appearance and size. It has many good merits such as good selfadaptability,
    compactness, easy real-time control, small volume and light weight.

  abstract: With advances in actuation and sensing materials and devices, there is
    a growing interest in developing underwater robots that propel and maneuver themselves
    as real fish do. Such robots, often known as robotic fish, could provide an engineering
    tool for understanding fish swimming. Equipped with communication capabilities
    and sensors, they could also serve as economical, dynamic samplers of aquatic
    environments. In this paper we discuss some of the major challenges in realizing
    adaptive, cost-effective, mobile sensor networks that are enabled by resource-constrained
    robotic fish. Such challenges include maneuvering in the presence of ambient disturbances,
    localization with adequate precision, sustained operation with minimal human interference,
    and cooperative control and sensing under communication constraints. We also present
    potential solutions and promising research directions for addressing these challenges,
    some of which are inspired by how fish solve similar problems.

  abstract: In this paper an innovative approach to robotics education is reported,
    where hands-on learning is integrated with cutting-edge research in the development
    of an autonomous, biomimetic robotic fish. The project aims to develop an energy-efficient,
    noiseless, untethered swimming robot for mobile sensing purposes. The robot is
    propelled by an ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuator and equipped with
    a GPS receiver, a ZigBee wireless communication module, a microcontroller, and
    a temperature sensor for autonomous navigation, control, and sensing. The two
    phases of the development are described, emphasizing both the technical approaches
    and the learning paradigms. The developed robotic fish will be further used as
    an educational kit for K-12 students and as a research tool for investigating
    multi-robot collaborative sensing. 2006 IEEE.

    I. Metabolic energy consumption as a function of speed and body size in birds
    and mammals.</span>
  container-title: The Journal of experimental biology
  page: 1-21
  volume: '97'
  issue: '1970'
  abstract: 'This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics
    and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used
    throughout the study: speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running
    animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable. This first paper
    considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating
    rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and
    domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores; four species of primates;
    and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to
    formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed
    (VO2/Mb) during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on
    data from 62 avian and mammalian species): VO2/Mb = 0.533 Mb-0.316.vg + 0.300
    Mb-0.303 where VO2/Mb has the units ml O2 s-1 kg-1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in
    m s-1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy
    consumption (Emetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20.1 J because
    the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible: Emetab/Mb = 10.7 Mb-0.316.vg
    + 6.03 Mb-0.303 where Emetab/Mb has the units watts/kg. This new relationship
    applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric
    equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen & Raab (1970). Ninety
    per cent of the values calculated from this genera equation for the diverse assortment
    of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25'

  page: 4656-4661 Vol.5
  abstract: The passive dynamic walker described in this paper is a robot with a minimal
    number of degrees of freedom which is still capable of stable 3D dynamic walking.
    First, we present the reduced-order dynamic models used to tune the characteristics
    of the robot’s passive gait. Our sagittal plane model is closely related to the
    compass gait model, but the steady state trajectory passively converges from a
    much larger range of initial conditions. We then experimentally quantify the stability
    of the mechanical device. Finally, we present an actuated version of the robot
    and some preliminary active control strategies. The control problem for the actuated
    version of the robot is interesting because although it is theoretically challenging
    (4 degrees of under-actuation), the mechanical design of the robot made it relatively
    easy to create controllers which allowed the robot to walk stably on flat terrain
    and even up a small slope.

    the robot in a simulation. Thanks in part to the mechanical design of the robot,
    the system is able to reliably acquire a robust policy for dynamic bipedal walking
    from a blank slate in less than 20 minutes. Once the robot begins walking, it

  abstract: 2015 IEEE. Here we present a closed-form solution to the continuous time-varying
    linear-quadratic regulator problem for zero-moment point (ZMP) tracking. This
    generalizes previous analytical solutions for gait generation by allowing "soft"
    tracking (with a quadratic cost) of the desired ZMP, and by providing the feedback
    gains for the resulting time-varying optimal controller. This enables very fast
    O(n) computation, with n the number of piecewise polynomial segments in the desired
    ZMP trajectory. Results are presented using the Atlas humanoid robot where dynamic
    walking is achieved by recomputing the optimal controller online.

  page: 521-531
  abstract: Prompted by the development of algorithms for analysing geometric tolerancing,
    this article describes a method to determine the Minkowski sum for 3-dimension
    polytopes. This purposed method is based exclusively on intersection operations
    on normal cones, using the properties of the normal fan of a Minkowski sum obtained
    by common refinement of the normal fans of the operands. It can be used to determine
    from which vertices of the operands the vertices of the Minkowski sum derive.
    It is also possible to determine to which facets of the operands each facet of
    the Minkowski sum is oriented. First, the main properties of the duality of normal
    cones and primal cones associated with the vertices of a polytope are described.
    Next, the properties of normal fans are applied to define the vertices and facets
    of the Minkowski sum of two polytopes. An algorithm is proposed which generalises
    the method. An example shows the application of the method on an assembly made
    up of two parts. Lastly, there is a discussion of the features of this algorithm,
    developed using the OpenCascade environment.

  abstract: The Harvard RoboBee is the first insect-scale flapping-wing robot weighing
    less than 100 mg that is able to lift its own weight. However, when flown without
    guide wires, this vehicle quickly tumbles after takeoff because of instability
    in its dynamics. Here, we show that by adding aerodynamic dampers, we can can
    alter the vehicle’s dynamics to stabilize its upright orientation. We provide
    an analysis using wind tunnel experiments and a dynamic model. We demonstrate
    stable vertical takeoff, and using a marker-based external camera tracking system,
    hovering altitude control in an active feedback loop. These results provide a
    stable platform for both system dynamics characterization and unconstrained active
    maneuvers of the vehicle and represent the first known hovering demonstration
    of an insect-scale flapping-wing robot.

  abstract: Natural organisms have a unique property not yet available in robotics,
    i.e., a self-healing (SH) ability. This powerful biological healing function has
    inspired chemists to impart similar properties to synthetic materials to create
    “SH materials.” Recent developments in SH polymers led us to investigate the potential
    of using these materials in robotics. This paper presents an innovative approach
    of using SH polymers, based on the reversible Diels–Alder (DA) reaction, in a
    compliant actuator. Using DA polymers, a sacrificial SH mechanical fuse (SH-MF)
    is designed, developed, and validated by placing it in a cable-driven robotic
    system. The fuse is designed as weakest element and will sacrificially fail if
    a damaging overload occurs, protecting the compliant element and other components
    of the system. The experimental results showed that this SH-MF could be healed
    at a relatively low temperature, recovering the initial mechanical properties.
    This first working prototype indicates the feasibility to use SH materials in
    robotics. “SH robotics” will lead to more sustainable and lighter systems, and
    eventually to more efficient designs. \[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\]

  abstract: The study describes the design and development of a single degree-of-freedom
    haptic robot, Haptic Theradrive, for post-stroke arm rehabilitation for in-home
    and clinical use. The robot overcomes many of the weaknesses of its predecessor,
    the TheraDrive system, that used a Logitech steering wheel as the haptic interface
    for rehabilitation. Although the original TheraDrive system showed success in
    a pilot study, its wheel was not able to withstand the rigors of use. A new haptic
    robot was developed that functions as a drop-in replacement for the Logitech wheel.
    The new robot can apply larger forces in interacting with the patient, thereby
    extending the functionality of the system to accommodate low-functioning patients.

    amplitude scaling of a temporal synergy</span>'

  page: 433-448
  volume: '169'

  abstract: To reduce the complexity of controlling hand-shaping, recent evidence
    suggests that the central nervous system uses synergies. In this study, two Rhesus
    monkeys reached-to-grasp 15 objects, varying in geometric properties, at five
    grasp force levels. Hand kinematics were recorded using a video-based tracking
    system. Individual finger movements were described as vectors varying in length
    and angle. Inflection points (i.e., stereotypic minima/maxima in the temporal
    profile of each finger vector) exhibited a temporal synchrony for individual fingers
    and in the coupling across fingers. Inflection point amplitudes varied significantly
    across objects grasped, scaling linearly with the object grasp dimension. Thus,
    differences in the vectors as a function of the objects were in the relative scaling
    of the vector parameters over time rather than a change in the temporal structure.
    Mahalanobis distance analysis of the inflection points confirmed that changes
    in inflection point amplitude as a function of objects were greater than changes
    in timing. Inflection points were independent of the grasp force, consistent with
    the observation that reach-to-grasp kinematics and grasp force are controlled
    independently. In summary, the shaping of the hand during reach-to-grasp involves
    scaling the amplitude of highly stereotypic temporal movements of the fingers.

  abstract: Attachment of dissimilar materials in engineering and surgical practice
    is a perennial challenge. Bimaterial attachment sites are common locations for
    injury, repeated injury, and mechanical failure. Nature presents several highly
    effective solutions to the challenge of bimaterial attachment that differ from
    those found in engineering practice. Structural Interfaces and Attachments in
    Biology describes the attachment of dissimilar materials from multiple perspectives.
    The text will simultaneously elucidate natural bimaterial attachments and outline
    engineering principles underlying successful attachments to the communities of
    tissue engineers and surgeons. Included an in-depth analysis of the biology of
    attachments in the body and mechanisms by which robust attachments are formed,
    a review of current concepts of attaching dissimilar materials in surgical practice
    and a discussion of bioengineering approaches that are currently being developed.

  container-title: Journal of Musculoskeletal Neuronal Interactions
  page: 35-45
  volume: '10'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The attachment of dissimilar materials is a major challenge because of
    the high levels of stress that develop at such interfaces. An effective solution
    to this problem develops at the attachment of tendon (a compliant "soft tissue")
    to bone (a stiff "hard tissue"). This tissue, the "enthesis", transitions from
    tendon to bone through gradations in structure, composition, and mechanical properties.
    These gradations are not regenerated during tendon-to-bone healing, leading to
    a high incidence of failure after surgical repair. Understanding the development
    of the enthesis may allow scientists to develop treatments that regenerate the
    natural tendon-to-bone insertion. Recent work has demonstrated that both biologic
    and mechanical factors drive the development and morphogenesis of the enthesis.
    A cascade of biologic signals similar to those seen in the growth plate promotes
    mineralization of cartilage on the bony end of the enthesis and the formation
    of fibrocartilage on the tendon end of the enthesis. Mechanical loading is also
    necessary for the development of the enthesis. Removal of muscle load impairs
    the formation of bone, fibrocartilage, and tendon at the developing enthesis.
    This paper reviews recent work on the development of the enthesis, with an emphasis
    on the roles of biologic and mechanical factors.

  page: 85-102
  volume: '246'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Anatomical differences among squirrels are usually most evident in the
    comparison of flying squirrels and nongliding squirrels. This is true of wrist
    anatomy, probably reflecting the specializations of flying squirrels for the extension
    of the wing tip and control of it during gliding. In the proximal row of carpals
    of most squirrels, the pisiform articulates only with the triquetrum, but in flying
    squirrels there is also a prominent articulation between the pisiform and the
    scapholunate, providing a more stable base for the styliform cartilage, which
    supports the wing tip. In the proximal wrist joint, between these carpals and
    the radius and ulna, differences in curvature of articular surfaces and in the
    location of ligaments also correlate with differences in degree and kind of movement
    occurring at this joint, principally reflecting the extreme dorsal flexion and
    radial deviation of the wrist in flying squirrels when gliding. The distal wrist
    joint, between the proximal and distal rows of carpals, also shows most variation
    among flying squirrels, principally in the articulations of the centrale with
    the other carpal bones, probably causing the distal row of carpal bones to function
    more like a single unit in some animals. There is little variation in wrist musculature,
    suggesting only minor evolutionary modification since the tribal radiation of
    squirrels, probably in the early Oligocene. Variation in the carpal bones, particularly
    the articulation of the pisiform with the triquetrum and the scapholunate, suggests
    a different suprageneric grouping of flying squirrels than previously proposed

  abstract: In this paper we present a novel system for sketching the motion of a
    character. The process begins by sketching a character to be animated. An animated
    motion is then created for the character by drawing a continuous sequence of lines,
    arcs, and loops. These are parsed and mapped to a parameterized set of output
    motions that further reflect the location and timing of the input sketch. The
    current system supports a repertoire of 18 different types of motions in 2D and
    a subset of these in 3D. The system is unique in its use of a cursive motion specification,
    its ability to allow for fast experimentation, and its ease of use for non-experts.

  container-title: Biology letters
  page: 253-6
  volume: '3'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Within the forest canopy, the shortest gaps between tree crowns lie between
    slender terminal branches. While the compliance of these supports has previously
    been shown to increase the energetic cost of gap crossing in arboreal animals
    (e.g. Alexander 1991 Z. Morphol. Anthropol. 78, 315-320; Demes et al. 1995 Am.
    J. Phys. Anthropol. 96, 419-429), field observations suggest that some primates
    may be able to use support compliance to increase the energetic efficiency of
    locomotion. Here, we calculate the energetic cost of alternative methods of gap
    crossing in orangutans (Pongo abelii). Tree sway (in which orangutans oscillate
    a compliant tree trunk with increasing magnitude to bridge a gap) was found to
    be less than half as costly as jumping, and an order of magnitude less costly
    than descending the tree, walking to the vine and climbing it. Observations of
    wild orangutans suggest that they actually use support compliance in many aspects
    of their locomotor behaviour. This study seems to be the first to show that elastic
    compliance in arboreal supports can be used to reduce the energetic cost of gap
    crossing.

    3D objects from freehand sketches</span>'
  container-title: CAD Computer Aided Design
  page: 147-158
  volume: '41'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: 'When designing a 3D object, designers, engineers and teachers often begin
    investigating potential design tradeoffs by creating informal sketches. Ideally,
    these sketches-in combination with a variety of engineering analysis tools-would
    allow prediction of the object’s physical properties, especially those that affect
    the critical early design process. We introduce a pen-based system that reconstructs
    3D spatial geometry from a single 2D freehand-sketch consisting of straight and
    curved lines in interactive time. Several optimization-based approaches to this
    problem have been proposed, but these generally have difficulty converging to
    an acceptable solution because the dimensionality of the search space is large.
    The primary contribution of this paper is a new reconstruction algorithm for orthographic
    projections of 3D wireframes. The algorithm reconstructs the depths of each vertex
    by exploiting geometric regularities among the graph lines in a reduced solution
    space, then optimizes a cost function over this space to recover the vertex depths.
    A second optimization algorithm is used to infer the 3D geometry of curved strokes
    once the vertex depths have been recovered. The proposed approach can recover
    the geometry of several objects with approximately 50 curved strokes in near interactive
    time. We also present an iterative, Tablet-PC-based design system that uses the
    proposed reconstruction algorithm to recover 3D objects from 2D orthographic sketches.
    The system allows the reconstructed objects to be subjected to two types of physical
    analysis, the results of which are superimposed directly on the sketch: a fast,
    kinematic simulation, and a complete finite-element-based static analysis. The
    object can quickly be modified in place using the pen-based interface according
    to the results of the analysis to allow for iterative design work. We demonstrate
    the system in action on a variety of early-stage design analyses. ?? 2009 Elsevier

  abstract: Seven form-finding methods for tensegrity structures are reviewed and
    clas- sified. The three kinematical methods include an analytical approach, a
    non-linear optimisation, and a pseudo-dynamic iteration. The four statical methods
    include an analytical method, the formulation of linear equations of equilibrium
    in terms of force densities, an energy minimisation, and a search for the equilibrium
    configurations of the struts of the structure con- nected by cables whose lengths
    are to be determined, using a reduced set of equilibrium equations. It is concluded
    that the kinematical methods are best suited to obtaining only configuration details
    of structures that are already essentially known, the force density method is
    best suited to searching for new configurations, but affords no control over the
    lengths of the elements of the structure. The reduced coordinates method offers
    a greater control on elements lengths, but requires more extensive symbolic manipulations.

  abstract: Stability is fundamental to the performance of terrestrial locomotion.
    Running cockroaches met the criteria for static stability over a wide range of
    speeds, yet several locomotor variables changed in a way that revealed an increase
    in the importance of dynamic stability as speed increased. Duty factors (the fraction
    of time that a leg spends on the ground relative to the stride period) decreased
    to 0.5 and below with an increase in speed. The duration of double support (i.e.
    when both tripods, or all six legs, were on the ground) decreased significantly
    with an increase in speed. All legs had similar touch-down phases in the tripod,
    but the shortest leg, the front one, lifted off before the middle and the rear
    leg, so that only two legs of the tripod were in contact with the ground at the
    highest speeds. Per cent stability margin (the shortest distance from the center
    of gravity to the boundaries of support, normalized to the maximum possible stability
    margin) decreased with increasing speed from 60

  volume: '1'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The natural selection and the evolutionary optimization of complex shapes
    in nature are closely related to their functions. Mechanostabilization of shape
    of biological structure via morphogenesis has several beautiful ex- amples. With
    the help of simple mechanics-based modeling and experiments, we show an important
    causality between natural shape selection as evolutionary outcome and the mechanostabilization
    of seashells. The effect of biological growth on the mechanostabilization process
    is identified with examples of two natural shapes of seashells, one having a diametrically
    converging localization of stresses and the other having a helicoidally con- centric
    localization of stresses. We demonstrate how the evolved shape enables predictable
    protection of soft body parts of the species. The effect of bioavailability of
    natural material is found to be a secondary factor com- pared to shape selectivity,
    where material microstructure only acts as a constraint to evolutionary optimization.
    This is confirmed by comparing the mechanostabilization behavior of three-dimensionally
    printed synthetic poly- mer structural shapes with that of natural seashells consisting
    of ceramic and protein. This study also highlights interesting possibilities in
    achieving a new design of structures made of ordinary materials which have bio-
    inspired optimization objectives.

    ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo).
    These species vary in body mass from 0.2 to 5.3 kg, and they use flight almost
    solely to escape predators. During take-off, all the species used a similar wingbeat
    style that appeared to be a vortex-ring gait with a tip reversal during the upstroke.
    The tip reversal is unusual for birds with rounded wings; it may offer an aerodynamic
    advantage during rapid acceleration. Flight anatomy generally scaled geometrically,
    except for average wing chord and wing area, which increased more than expected
    as body mass (m) increased. Pectoralis strain varied from 19.1 to 35.2'

  abstract: This paper presents numerical methods for computing regions of finite-time
    invariance (funnels) around solutions of polynomial differential equations. The
    methods are compared on stabilized trajectories of a six-state model of a satellite.
    First, we present a method which exactly certifies sufficient conditions for invariance
    despite relying on approximate trajectories from numerical integration. Our second
    method relaxes the constraints of the first by sampling in time. On the model
    system, this recovered almost identical funnels but was much faster to compute.
    In both cases, funnels are verified using Sum-of-Squares programming to search
    over time-varying quadratic Lyapunov functions. We examine both time-varying rescalings
    of quadratic forms computed from linearizations and searching directly over time-varying
    quadratic Lyapunov functions. On the model system the latter provided larger funnels
    at the cost of increased computation time. 2011 IFAC.

  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: 18616-18620
  volume: '106'
  issue: '44'
  abstract: Nest building in social insects is among the collective processes that
    show highly conservative features such as basic modules (chambers and galleries)
    or homeostatic properties. Although ant nests share common characteristics, they
    exhibit a high structural variability, of which morphogenesis and underlying mechanisms
    remain largely unknown. We conducted two-dimensional nest-digging experiments
    under homogeneous laboratory conditions to investigate the shape diversity that
    emerges only from digging dynamics and without the influence of any environmental
    heterogeneity. These experiments revealed that, during the excavation, a morphological
    transition occurs because the primary circular cavity evolves into a ramified
    structure through a branching process. Such a transition is observed, whatever
    the number of ants involved, but occurs more frequently for a larger number of
    workers. A stochastic model highlights the central role of density effects in
    shape transition. These results indicate that nest digging shares similar properties
    with various physical, chemical, and biological systems. Moreover, our model of
    morphogenesis provides an explanatory framework for shape transitions in decentralized
    growing structures in group-living animals.

  abstract: and micro valves are crucial components for achieving these advanced platforms.
    \[ 3 \] Thin-fi lm piezoelectric actuators promise reliable operation and high
    throughput, however com-plex motions and fl exible deformations, observed in natural
    systems, are hard to achieve. For example, aortic valves, one of the most frequently
    diseased tissues, are repaired by trans-planting a synthetic mechanical device
    or an allograft tissue alternative. These artifi cial ones are far from the original
    organs whose specialized motions are achieved by fl exible hier-archically structured
    tissues with complex architectures. \[ 4 \] On the other hand, hydrogel-based
    soft actuators are promising \[ 5 \] due to the large extent to which they can
    be deformed in aqueous media, thereby conforming to an architecture that mimics
    natural systems. Large complex 3D architectures can be fabricated with ease, if
    spontaneous chemical reactions are involved in their fabrication method. Moreover,
    3D ink-jet printing is reportedly applicable to the production of these polymer-based
    actuation systems. \[ 1 \] We here demonstrate adaptive microarchitectures that
    exhibit a special peristaltic motion by employing hydrogel actuation on bilayered
    materials. The surface architectures were designed by mimicking wrinkles in nature.
    The organ, skin, is a good example of wrinkles with an adaptive response, where
    wrin-kles appear and disappear depending on the movement of the muscles underneath.
    Here, greatly simplifying, these surface wrinkles form on a bilayered material
    of a crust top layer (skin) and an elastic bottom layer (muscles). As the bottom
    layer con-tracts (or the top layer swells), stress-driven instabilities are gen-erated
    at the interface of the layers. The accumulated stress is then released through
    the formation of wrinkles on the crust layer. Such stimuli-responsive wrinkles
    were reported on arti-fi cial bilayered materials prepared from elastomers or
    resins. \[ 6 \] Nevertheless, artifi cial wrinkles, which exhibit large deforma-tions
    and undergo reversible adaptive response in liquids, are still challenging and
    are highly required to exploit applications in biological systems. In the present
    study, we designed and fab-ricated a bilayered structure made of PNIPAM and hybrid
    silica (Figure 1 a). 3-(Methacryloxy)propyl triethoxysilane was used as a silica
    source to allow copolymerization with NIPAM and a cross-linker (N,N′ -methylenebis(acrylamide),
    MBA) at the interface of the heterogeneous two layers. The thickness of the hybrid
    silica layer was tuned from 680 nm to 1.5 µm by using Pluronic F127 as a viscosity
    improver. This approach allows the strong adhesion at the interface and, most
    importantly, the complex actuation in liquid phase. PNIPAM undergoes shape change
    at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), \[ 7 \] and thereby wrinkles
    of submillimeter dimensions appear and disappear as a function of the changing
    environmental temperature. Signifi cantly large deformations (\>40

  container-title: IEEE international conference on robotics and automation
  page: 83-89
  volume: '4'
  abstract: This paper presents an approach to synthesizing the control required by
    a dextrous multifingered robot hand to reach and safely grasp an arbitrary target
    object. The synthesis is based on analysis of the grasping task as performed by
    human beings. We divide the task into (1) a target approach phase (including target
    identification, hand structure and grasp mode selection, selection of approach
    trajectory, hand preshaping and orientation) and (2) a grasp execution phase (including
    shape and force adaptation). Each aspect of the required control is discussed.
    Particular attention is paid to the role of geometric modeling in target identification,
    to preshaping during the approach trajectory and to the requirements for autonomy
    in completion of the grasping task. The underlying philosophy is that of reflex
    control; each aspect of the grasping task is initiated and terminated using sensory
    data and rules of behavior derived from human expertise in such tasks. The contents
    and organization of the knowledge base which codifies this expertise are discussed.
    The fundamental assumptions upon which this control philosophy is based are identified
    throughout the paper. Preliminary results of a graphical simulation of hand preshaping
    are given.

  abstract: Plant roots represent an amazing source of inspiration for designing and
    developing dexterous, branching robots capable of efficient soil exploration in
    various scenarios, from environmental monitoring to space exploration. The natural
    roots, in fact, have optimally evolved to efficiently penetrate and move into
    the soil. In this work, starting from the study of the plant roots penetration
    capabilities, we defined the optimal tip shape and the penetration rate of a robotic
    root apex, by evaluating the penetration resistance to different types of granular
    substrates. The results showed that the conical and parabolic tips with a pointed
    shape, similar to the apex tip of the living roots, are more efficient in terms
    of penetration resistance. The penetration resistance of the robotic root apex
    results similar to that observed in natural roots. Moreover, we identified the
    optimal penetration rate of the root-like robotic system as 40 mm/min.

  abstract: This paper is concerned with the design and control of actuators for machines
    and robots physically interacting with humans, implementing criteria established
    in our previous work \[1\] on optimal mechanical-control co-design for intrinsically
    safe, yet performant machines. In our Variable Impedance Actuation (VIA) approach,
    actuators control in real-time both the reference position and the mechanical
    impedance of the moving parts in the machine in such a way to optimize performance
    while intrinsically guaranteeing safety. In this paper we describe an implementation
    of such concepts, consisting of a novel electromechanical Variable Stiffness Actuation
    (VSA) motor. The design and the functioning principle of the VSA are reported,
    along with the analysis of its dynamic behavior. A novel scheme for feedback control
    of this device is presented, along with experimental results showing performance
    and safety of a one-link arm actuated by the VSA motor. 2005 IEEE.

  abstract: Muscular hydrostats (such as mollusks), and fluid-filled animals (such
    as annelids), can exploit their constant-volume tissues to transfer forces and
    displacements in predictable ways, much as articulated animals use hinges and
    levers. Although larval insects contain pressurized fluids, they also have internal
    air tubes that are compressible and, as a result, they have more uncontrolled
    degrees of freedom. Therefore, the mechanisms by which larval insects control
    their movements are expected to reveal useful strategies for designing soft biomimetic
    robots. Using caterpillars as a tractable model system, it is now possible to
    identify the biomechanical and neural strategies for controlling movements in
    such highly deformable animals. For example, the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta,
    can stiffen its body by increasing muscular tension (and therefore body pressure)
    but the internal cavity (hemocoel) is not iso-barometric, nor is pressure used
    to directly control the movements of its limbs. Instead, fluid and tissues flow
    within the hemocoel and the body is soft and flexible to conform to the substrate.
    Even the gut contributes to the biomechanics of locomotion; it is decoupled from
    the movements of the body wall and slides forward within the body cavity at the
    start of each step. During crawling the body is kept in tension for part of the
    stride and compressive forces are exerted on the substrate along the axis of the
    caterpillar, thereby using the environment as a skeleton. The timing of muscular
    activity suggests that crawling is coordinated by proleg-retractor motoneurons
    and that the large segmental muscles produce anterograde waves of lifting that
    do not require precise timing. This strategy produces a robust form of locomotion
    in which the kinematics changes little with orientation. In different species
    of caterpillar, the presence of prolegs on particular body segments is related
    to alternative kinematics such as "inching." This suggests a mechanism for the
    evolution of different gaits through changes in the usage of prolegs, rather than,
    through extensive alterations in the motor program controlling the body wall.
    Some of these findings are being used to design and test novel control-strategies
    for highly deformable robots. These "softworm" devices are providing new insights
    into the challenges faced by any soft animal navigating in a terrestrial environment.

  abstract: Traditional robots have rigid underlying structures that limit their ability
    to interact with their environment. For example, conventional robot manipulators
    have rigid links and can manipulate objects using only their specialised end effectors.
    These robots often encounter difficulties operating in unstructured and highly
    congested environments. A variety of animals and plants exhibit complex movement
    with soft structures devoid of rigid components. Muscular hydrostats (e.g. octopus
    arms and elephant trunks) are almost entirely composed of muscle and connective
    tissue and plant cells can change shape when pressurised by osmosis. Researchers
    have been inspired by biology to design and build soft robots. With a soft structure
    and redundant degrees of freedom, these robots can be used for delicate tasks
    in cluttered and/or unstructured environments. This paper discusses the novel
    capabilities of soft robots, describes examples from nature that provide biological
    inspiration, surveys the state of the art and outlines existing challenges in

  abstract: Two- and three-dimensional low-aspect-ratio (AR = 4) hovering airfoil/wing
    aerodynamics at a low Reynolds number (Re = 100) are numerically investigated.
    Regarding fluid physics, in addition to the well-known leading-edge vortex and
    wake-capture mechanisms, a persistent jet, induced by the shed vortices in the
    wake during previous strokes, and tip vortices can significantly influence the
    lift and power performance. While in classical stationary wing theory the tip
    vortices are seen as wasted energy, here, they can interact with the leading-edge
    vortex to contribute to the lift generated without increasing the power requirements.
    Using surrogate modeling techniques, the two- and three-dimensional time-averaged
    aerodynamic forces were predicted well over a large range of kinematic motions
    when compared with the Navier-Stokes solutions. The combined effects of tip vortices,
    leading-edge vortex, and jet can be manipulated by the choice of kinematics to
    make a three-dimensional wing aerodynamically better or worse than an infinitely
    long wing. The environmental sensitivity during hovering for select kinematics
    is also examined. Different freestream strengths and orientations are imposed,
    with the impact on vortex generation and wake interaction investigated. Copyright

  page: 378-383
  abstract: This paper describes the design and modelling of a new variable stiffness
    actuator (CompAct-VSA). The principle of operation of CompAct-VSA is based on
    a lever arm mechanism with a continuously regulated pivot point. The proposed
    concept allows for the development of an actuation unit with a wide range of stiffness
    and a fast stiffness regulation response. The implementation of the actuator makes
    use of a cam shaped lever arm with a variable pivot axis actuated by a rack and
    pinion transmission system. This realization results in a highly integrated and
    modular assembly. Size and weight are indeed an open issue in the VSAs design,
    which ultimately limit their implementation in multi-dof robotic systems. The
    paper introduces the mechanics, the principle of operation and the model of the
    actuator. Preliminary results are presented to demonstrate the fast stiffness
    regulation response and the wide range of stiffness achieved by the proposed CompAct-VSA
    design.

  abstract: 'This paper describes a novel controller that is capable of simultaneously
    controlling torque and variable stiffness in real-time, for actuators with antagonistically
    driven pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). To this end, two contributions are
    presented: i) A stable force feedback controller that can cope with inherent PAM
    nonlinearities is synthesized using the dissipativity theory, for each PAM unit.
    ii) On top of this force feedback controller, a mathematical formulation is developed
    to compute reference force inputs that correspond to desired joint torque and
    joint stiffness inputs, concerning both agonist and antagonist PAMs. This strategy
    enables us to introduce real-time sensory feedback; torque and stiffness control
    is addressed by means of PAM force feedback control with guaranteed stability.
    To validate the proposed control scheme, a series of experiments were conducted
    on an experimental setup. As the result, the controller exhibited favorable torque
    and stiffness tracking in real-time, demonstrating that it could meet the performance
    criteria to power exoskeleton systems.'

  abstract: Robots that can easily interact with humans and move through natural environments
    are becomingessential as assistive devices in the home, office and hospital. These
    machines need to be, effective, and easy to control. One strategy towards accomplishing
    these goals is to build theusing soft and flexible materials to make them much
    more approachable and less likely totheir environment. A major challenge is that
    comparatively little is known about how best to, fabricate and control deformable
    machines. Here we describe the design, fabrication andof a novel soft robotic
    platform (Softworms) as a modular device for research, education andoutreach.
    These robots are inspired by recent neuromechanical studies of crawling andby
    larval moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera, caterpillars). Unlike most soft robots
    currentlydevelopment, the Softworms do not rely on pneumatic or fluidic actuators
    but are electricallyand actuated using either shape-memory alloy microcoils or
    motor tendons, and they can beto accept other muscle-like actuators such as electroactive
    polymers. The technology isversatile, and different designs can be quickly and
    cheaply fabricated by casting elastomericor by direct 3D printing. Softworms can
    crawl, inch or roll, and they are steerable and evensteep inclines. Softworms
    can be made in any shape but here we describe modular anddesigns requiring little
    assembly. These modules can be combined to make multi-limbed.Wealso describe two
    approaches for controlling such highly deformable structures usingmodel-free state
    transition-reward matrices or distributed, mechanically coupled oscillators. Into
    their value as a research platform, these robots can be developed for use in environmental,and
    space applications where cheap, lightweight and shape-changing deformable robots
    willnew performance capabilities.

  container-title: 2014 ieee international conference on robotics and automation (icra)

  page: 2874-2879
  abstract: Both postural maintenance and rhythm generation are keys to generating
    adaptive behavior in all animals. This is particularly evident in soft animals
    such as caterpillars, worm and flatworms that are capable of moving freely in
    all directions and adopting intricate postures. They can also exploit three-dimensional
    deformations and nonlinear structural properties to move in complex environments
    and to respond to external forces. These capabilities have inspired a new interest
    in using soft materials in robotic applications but highly deformable materials
    create significant design and control problems. In previous work the authors have
    developed a 3D-printed soft (3D-PS) robot, inspired by caterpillars, as a platform
    to investigate methods for controlling soft robots. The previous version of the
    robot is able to reproduce the different gait patterns (inching and crawling motion)
    of caterpillars by changing temporal difference in the rhythmic deformations of
    different body parts. In this paper, we have added posture control to the 3D-PS
    robot together with a steering capability. Experimental results show that although
    posture and steering are usually related, elastic and continuum properties of
    the soft body can produce more complex and versatile behaviors.

  abstract: Three dimensional printing (3DP) is a method for direct digital manufacturing
    that provides capabilities for creating a wide range of part geometries (including
    internal channels) in a broad variety of materials, including just about anything
    that is available as a spreadable powder. Taking advantage of the full variety
    of materials requires development of specific implementations of 3DP. This paper
    organizes the process of 3DP implementation into five steps (powder formulation,
    binder method selection, binder formulation and testing, printing process specification,
    and post-processing specification) and presents a review of the literature relevant
    to each step in 3DP implementation. ?? 2009 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

  abstract: We explore the relation between spatial thinking and performance and attainment
    in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) domains. Spatial skills
    strongly predict who will go into STEM fields. But why is this true? We argue
    that spatial skills serve as a gateway or barrier for entry into STEM fields.
    We review literature that indicates that psychometrically-assessed spatial abilities
    predict performance early in STEM learning, but become less predicative as students
    advance toward expertise. Experts often have mental representations that allow
    them to solve problems without having to use spatial thinking. For example, an
    expert chemist who knows a great deal about the structure and behavior of a particular
    molecule may not need to mentally rotate a representation of this molecule in
    order to make a decision about it. Novices who have low levels of spatial skills
    may not be able to advance to the point at which spatial skills become less important.
    Thus, a program of spatial training might help to increase the number of people
    who go into STEM fields. We review and give examples of work on spatial training,
    which show that spatial abilities are quite malleable. Our chapter helps to constrain
    and specify when and how spatial abilities do (or do not) matter in STEM thinking
    and learning.

  abstract: 'Recordings from single peripheral nerve fibres made it possible to analyse
    the functional properties of tactile afferent units supplying the glabrous skin
    of the human hand and to assess directly the relation between impulse discharge
    and perceptive experiences. The 17,000 tactile units in this skin area of the
    human hand are of four different types: two fast adapting types, FA I and FA II
    (formerly RA and PC), and two slowly adapting types, SA I and SA II. The receptive
    field characteristics and the densities in the skin of the type I units (FA I
    and SA I) indicate that these account for the detailed spatial resolution that
    is of paramount importance for the motor skill and the explorative role of the
    hand. The relationship between the stimulus amplitude and perceived intensity
    during sustained skin indentations did not match the corresponding stimulus response
    functions of SA units suggesting non-linear transformations within the central
    nervous system. These transformations, in turn, appear to vary between subjects.
    A single impulse in a single FA I unit may be felt when originating from the most
    important tactile regions of the hand, indicating that the psychophysical detection
    may be set by the threshold of the sense organs. Moreover, no significant noise
    seems to be superimposed in the respective central sensory pathways.'

  volume: '215'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: Landing behavior is one of the most critical, yet least studied, aspects
    of insect flight. In order to land safely, an insect must recognize a visual feature,
    navigate towards it, decelerate, and extend its legs in preparation for touchdown.
    Although previous studies have focused on the visual stimuli that trigger these
    different components, the complete sequence has not been systematically studied
    in a free-flying animal. Using a real-time 3D tracking system in conjunction with
    high speed digital imaging, we were able to capture the landing sequences of fruit
    flies (Drosophila melanogaster) from the moment they first steered toward a visual
    target, to the point of touchdown. This analysis was made possible by a custom-built
    feedback system that actively maintained the fly in the focus of the high speed
    camera. The results suggest that landing is composed of three distinct behavioral
    modules. First, a fly actively turns towards a stationary target via a directed
    body saccade. Next, it begins to decelerate at a point determined by both the
    size of the visual target and its rate of expansion on the retina. Finally, the
    fly extends its legs when the visual target reaches a threshold retinal size of
    approximately 60 deg. Our data also let us compare landing sequences with flight
    trajectories that, although initially directed toward a visual target, did not
    result in landing. In these ‘fly-by’ trajectories, flies steer toward the target
    but then exhibit a targeted aversive saccade when the target subtends a retinal
    size of approximately 33 deg. Collectively, the results provide insight into the
    organization of sensorimotor modules that underlie the landing and search behaviors
    of insects.

  abstract: Previous research has shown that passive (or ballistic) walking is an
    energetic efficient and mechanical cheap way of walking. Therefore ballistic walking
    would be suitable for applications in rehabilitation technology and autonomous
    robots. Successful application would require a smooth hip trajectory in order
    to protect respectively the patient or electronics against large velocity changes
    due to ground collisions. It is shown that an actively adjustable stance leg compliance
    in combination with a viscous damping can result in smaller hip velocity changes.

  abstract: 'Unlike horizontal crawling, vertical crawling involves two counteracting
    forces: torque rotating the body around its center of mass and gravity resisting
    forward movement. The influence of these forces on kinematics has been examined
    in the soft-bodied larval stage of Manduca sexta. We found that crawling and climbing
    are accomplished using the same movements, with both segment timing and proleg
    lift indistinguishable in horizontal and vertical locomotion. Minor differences
    were detected in stride length and in the delay between crawls, which led to a
    lower crawling speed in the vertical orientation. Although these differences were
    statistically significant, they were much smaller than the variation in kinematic
    parameters between animals. The ability of Manduca to crawl and climb using the
    same movements is best explained by Manduca’s relatively small size, slow speed
    and strong, controlled, passive grip made possible by its proleg/crochets.'

  page: 761-768
  volume: '55'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: In this paper a rotational actuator with a novel adaptable compliance
    (inverse of stiffness) is presented. First, a number of comparable designs are
    given with their possible drawbacks. The MACCEPA concept and design is then described
    in detail. The equation to calculate the generated torque is derived. Depending
    on the design parameters, it is shown that the torque is a quasi linear function
    with respect to the angle between the equilibrium position and the actual position.
    Also, the change of the pre-tension has a quasi linear effect on the torque. Another
    advantage is that the actuator can be built with standard components, e.g. electrical
    servo motors. Experiments show independent control of the equilibrium position
    and compliance. The use of the MACCEPA in the Controlled Passive Walking biped
    Veronica is described. Controlled Passive Walking is an approach that combines
    the advantages of actively controlled robots and passive walkers. By adapting
    the compliance of the joints, natural motions can be chosen in order to obtain
    a controllable and energy efficient walking motion. To test the concept, the biped
    Veronica is built, actuated by six MACCEPAs. 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Living nature and human technology apply different principles to create
    hard, strong and tough materials. In this review, we compare and discuss prominent
    aspects of these alternative strategies, and demonstrate for selected examples
    that nanoscale-precision biotemplating is able to produce uncommon mechanical
    properties as well as actuating behavior, resembling to some extent the properties
    of the original natural templates. We present and discuss mechanical testing data
    showing for the first time that nanometer-precision biotemplating can lead to
    porous ceramic materials with deformation characteristics commonly associated
    with either biological or highly advanced technical materials. We also review
    recent findings on the relation between hierarchical structuring and humidity-induced
    directional motion. Finally, we discuss to which extent the observed behavior
    is in agreement with previous results and theories on the mechanical properties
    of multiscale hierarchical materials, as well as studies of highly disperse technical

  abstract: Variable Impedance Actuators (VIA) have received increasing attention
    in recent years as many novel applications involving interactions with an unknown
    and dynamic environment including humans require actuators with dynamics that
    are not well-achieved by classical stiff actuators. This paper presents an overview
    of the different VIAs developed and proposes a classification based on the principles
    through which the variable stiffness and damping are achieved. The main classes
    are active impedance by control, inherent compliance and damping actuators, inertial
    actuators, and combinations of them, which are then further divided into subclasses.
    This classification allows for designers of new devices to orientate and take
    inspiration and users of VIA’s to be guided in the design and implementation process
    for their targeted application. 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Additive manufacturing technologies can now be used to manufacture metallic
    parts. This breakthrough in manufacturing technology makes possible the fabrication
    of new shapes and geometrical features. Although the manufacturing feasibility
    of sample parts with these processes has been the subject of several studies,
    the breakthrough in manufacturing is yet to be followed by a breakthrough in designing
    process. In this paper, after reviewing the principle of additive manufacturing
    of metallic parts, the manufacturing capabilities and constraints of these processes
    will be examined. A designing methodology will then be suggested and illustrated
    with the redesign of an example part. 2012 The Authors.

  title: Dexterous Robotic Hands
  publisher: Springer-Verlag
  publisher-place: New York
  page: '345'
  abstract: 'Manipulation using dextrous robot hands has been an exciting yet frustrating
    research topic for the last several years. While significant progress has occurred
    in the design, construction, and low level control of robotic hands, researchers
    are up against fundamental problems in developing algorithms for real-time computations
    in multi-sensory processing and motor control. The aim of this book is to explore
    parallels in sensorimotor integration in dextrous robot and human hands, addressing
    the basic question of how the next generation of dextrous hands should evolve.
    By bringing together experimental psychologists, kinesiologists, computer scientists,
    electrical engineers, and mechanical engineers, the book covers topics that range
    from human hand usage in prehension and exploration, to the design and use of
    robotic sensors and multi-fingered hands, and to control and computational architectures
    for dextrous hand usage. While the ultimate goal of capturing human hand versatility
    remains elusive, this book makes an important contribution to the design and control
    of future dextrous robot hands through a simple underlying message: a topic as
    complex as dextrous manipulation would best be addressed by collaborative, interdisciplinary
    research, combining high level and low level views, drawing parallels between
    human studies and analytic approaches, and integrating sensory data with motor
    commands. As seen in this text, success has been made through the establishment
    of such collaborative efforts. The future will hold up to expectations only as
    researchers become aware of advances in parallel fields and as a common vocabulary
    emerges from integrated perceptions about manipulation.'

    . Abstract Curved - line folding is the act of folding a flat sheet of material
    along a curved crease pattern in order to create a 3D shape , using the combination
    of folding (plastic deformation) and bending (elastic deformation) . Most applications
    of curved - line folding only make use of the end state of the folding process
    : a static solution obtained through folding along a curved crease pattern . However
    , the elastic deformations that occur when a flat sheet is forced into a curved
    shape can produce an interesting transformation process . When one surface area
    is bent , the forces and moments are transmitted through the curved creases to
    the adjacent surface areas , which results in a folding motion . As a result ,
    this kind of transformation process could be used for the development of a new
    type of deployable structure , finding its application in the context of kinetic
    shading systems . The aim of this paper is to give an overview of how this transformation
    process can be modelled and analysed in a digital environment . Existing methods
    as well as some new approaches are discussed and evaluated . A distinction is
    made between pure geometrical modelling methods and simulations with finite elements
    software . It can be concluded that the existing tools for geometrical modelling
    of the folding process of deployable structures based on curved - line folding
    are sufficient to quickly check the deployment of different curved - line folding
    patterns and can find their application in the early design stage . However ,
    for a more profound analysis , which takes into account material properties and
    forces , a calculation with finite elements is required .'

  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 5665-5672
  volume: '65'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: In this paper, a novel analytical-based kinematic and dynamic modeling
    and control approach is developed for reference speed tracking of a multijoint
    robotic fish. The kinematic model is improved by the introduction of input signal
    for controlling body undulation amplitude without distorting the model structure.
    Next, the dynamic model is developed in the discrete-time domain primarily because
    fish swimming pattern generates oscillating continuous thrust where the effect
    of thrust over one cycle of undulation can be calculated through averaging. Hence,
    the dynamics can be discretized according to the undulation rate. The novelty
    in developing the discrete-time dynamical model is three fold. First, the thrust
    gradient is derived with assistance of Lighthill’s large amplitude elongated body
    theory. More importantly, affine-in-control dynamical model form, essential for
    designing a real-time model-based control algorithm, is derived by inclusion of
    the updated kinematic model. Second, the thrust delay is studied via pulse input
    response of the motion system, and incorporated in the dynamical model. Third,
    drag force coefficient calculation is also proposed by comparing the thrust model
    and empirically recorded steady-state speeds of the robotic fish. Finally, discrete-time
    model-based sliding-mode control (SMC) is designed for speed tracking. Experimental
    results verify that SMC based on the proposed dynamical model, can significantly
    improve speed tracking performance of a multilink robotic fish. 1982-2012 IEEE.

  abstract: A mechanism exerts forces and moments on its supporting frame, which result
    in vibration. The aim of counterweight balancing is to reduce this vibration by
    adding counterweights on the moving mechanism links. This paper shows that, even
    for the complicated case of spatial mechanisms, finding the counterweight parameters
    that result in minimal forces and moments under constrained driving torque is
    an optimization problem that can be reformulated as a convex problem. This reformulation
    uses voxel-based discretizations, inspired by the typical discretizations used
    in the area of topology optimization, and results in counterweight shapes that
    can easily be implemented in practice. The advantages of the proposed methodology
    in terms of computation time, balancing result and practicality of the counterweights
    are demonstrated using a literature benchmark consisting of a RSSR - spatial fourbar
    mechanism. 2008 by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical

  abstract: 'Vertebrates swimming with undulations of the body and tail have inflection
    points where the curvature of the body changes from concave to convex or vice
    versa. These inflection points travel down the body at the speed of the running
    wave of bending. In movements with increasing amplitudes, the body rotates around
    the inflection points, inducing semicircular flows in the adjacent water on both
    sides of the body that together form proto-vortices. Like the inflection points,
    the proto-vortices travel towards the end of the tail. In the experiments described
    here, the phase relationship between the tailbeat cycle and the inflection point
    cycle can be used as a first approximation of the phase between the proto-vortex
    and the tailbeat cycle. Proto-vortices are shed at the tail as body vortices at
    roughly the same time as the inflection points reach the tail tip. Thus, the phase
    between proto-vortex shedding and tailbeat cycle determines the interaction between
    body and tail vortices, which are shed when the tail changes direction. The shape
    of the body wave is under the control of the fish and determines the position
    of vortex shedding relative to the mean path of motion. This, in turn, determines
    whether and how the body vortex interacts with the tail vortex. The shape of the
    wake and the contribution of the body to thrust depend on this interaction between
    body vortex and tail vortex. So far, we have been able to describe two types of
    wake. One has two vortices per tailbeat where each vortex consists of a tail vortex
    enhanced by a body vortex. A second, more variable, type of wake has four vortices
    per tailbeat: two tail vortices and two body vortices shed from the tail tip while
    it is moving from one extreme position to the next. The function of the second
    type is still enigmatic.'

  abstract: We demonstrate a new approach for designing functional mate- rial definitions
    for multi-material fabrication using our system called Foundry. Foundry provides
    an interactive and visual process for hierarchically designing spatially-varying
    material properties (e.g., appearance, mechanical, optical). The result- ing meta-materials
    exhibit structure at the micro and macro level and can surpass the qualities of
    traditional composites. The material definitions are created by composing a set
    of operators into an operator graph. Each operator performs a volume decomposition
    operation, remaps space, or constructs and assigns a material composition. The
    operators are imple- mented using a domain-specific language for multi-material
    fabrication; users can easily extend the library by writing their own operators.
    Foundry can be used to build operator graphs that describe complex, parameterized,
    resolution-independent, and reusable material definitions. We also describe how
    to stage the evaluation of the final material definition which in conjunction
    with progressive refinement, allows for interac- tive material evaluation even
    for complex designs. We show sophisticated and functional parts designed with
    our system.

    miniature robotics</span>
  container-title: Bioinspiration & Biomimetics
  page: '025006'
  volume: '10'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Recent work suggests that jumping locomotion in combination with a gliding
    phase can be used as an effective mobility principle in robotics. Compared to
    pure jumping without a gliding phase, the potential benefits of hybrid jump-gliding
    locomotion includes the ability to extend the distance travelled and reduce the
    potentially damaging impact forces upon landing. This publication evaluates the
    performance of jump-gliding locomotion and provides models for the analysis of
    the relevant dynamics of flight. It also defines a jump-gliding envelope that
    encompasses the range that can be achieved with jump-gliding robots and that can
    be used to evaluate the performance and improvement potential of jump-gliding
    robots. We present first a planar dynamic model and then a simplified closed form
    model, which allow for quantification of the distance travelled and the impact
    energy on landing. In order to validate the prediction of these models, we validate
    the model with experiments using a novel jump-gliding robot, named the ’EPFL jump-glider’.
    It has a mass of 16.5 g and is able to perform jumps from elevated positions,
    perform steered gliding flight, land safely and traverse on the ground by repetitive
    jumping. The experiments indicate that the developed jump-gliding model fits very
    well with the measured flight data using the EPFL jump-glider, confirming the
    benefits of jump-gliding locomotion to mobile robotics. The jump-glide envelope
    considerations indicate that the EPFL jump-glider, when traversing from a 2 m
    height, reaches 74.3

    now classic 1986 text has been written to educate the engineering reader in the
    various aspects of mechanics for using composite materials in the design and analysis
    of composite structures and products. Areas dealt with include manufacture, micromechanical
    properties, structural design, joints and bonding and a much needed introduction
    to composite design philosophy. Each chapter is concluded by numerous problems
    suitable for home assignments or examination. A solution guide is available on

  issue: February
  abstract: In two experiments, each using a different product (either a CD-ROM based
    eleclxonic book or an interactive voice response system), we compared the usability
    problems uncovered using low- and high-fidelity prototypes. One group of subjects
    performed a series of tasks using a paper- based low-fidelity prototype, while
    another performed the same tasks using either a high-fidelity prototype or the
    actual product. In both experiments, substantially the same sets of usability
    problems were found in the low- and high- fidelity conditions. Moreover, there
    was a significant correlation between the proportion of subjects detecting particular
    problems in the low- and high-fidelity groups. In other words, individual problems
    were detected by a similar proportion of subjects in both the low- and high-fidelity
    conditions. We conclude that the use of low-fidelity prototypes can be effective
    throughout the product development cycle, not just during the initial stages of
    design.

  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Robotics
  page: 865-875
  volume: '27'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Variable stiffness actuators are a particular class of actuators that
    is characterized by the property that the apparent output stiffness can be changed
    independent of the output position. To achieve this, variable stiffness actuators
    consist of a number of elastic elements and a number of actuated degrees of freedom,
    which determine how the elastic elements are perceived at the actuator output.
    Changing the apparent output stiffness is useful for a broad range of applications,
    which explains the increasing research interest in this class of actuators. In
    this paper, a generic, port-based model for variable stiffness actuators is presented,
    with which a wide variety of designs can be modeled and analyzed. From the analysis
    of the model, it is possible to derive kinematic properties that variable stiffness
    actuator designs should satisfy in order to be energy efficient. More specifically,
    the kinematics should be such that the apparent output stiffness can be varied
    without changing the potential energy that is stored in the internal elastic elements.
    A concept design of an energy-efficient variable stiffness actuator is presented
    and implemented. Simulations of the model and experiments on the realized prototype
    validate the design principle. 2011 IEEE.

  abstract: Underwater robot is a new research field which is emerging quickly in
    recent years. Previous researches in this field focus on Remotely Operated Vehicles
    (ROVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), underwater manipulators, etc. Fish
    robot, which is a new type of underwater biomimetic robot, has attracted great
    attention because of its silence in moving and energy efficiency compared to conventional
    propeller-oriented propulsive mechanism. However, most of researches on fish robots
    have been carried out via empirical or experimental approaches, not based on dynamic
    optimality. In this paper, we proposed an analytical optimization approach which
    can guarantee the maximum propulsive velocity of fish robot in the given parametric
    conditions. First, a dynamic model of 3-joint (4 links) carangiform fish robot
    is derived, using which the influences of parameters of input torque functions,
    such as amplitude, frequency and phase difference, on its velocity are investigated
    by simulation. Second, the maximum velocity of the fish robot is optimized by
    combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Hill Climbing Algorithm (HCA). GA is used
    to generate the initial optimal parameters of the input functions of the system.
    Then, the parameters are optimized again by HCA to ensure that the final set of
    parameters is the "near" global optimization. Finally, both simulations and primitive
    experiments are carried out to prove the feasibility of the proposed method. 2009

  container-title: European Physical Journal E
  volume: '35'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Many types of bacteria swim by rotating a bundle of helical filaments
    also called flagella. Each filament is driven by a rotary motor and a very flexible
    hook transmits the motor torque to the filament. We model it by discretizing Kirchhoff’s
    elastic-rod theory and develop a coarse-grained approach for driving the helical
    filament by a motor torque. A rotating flagellum generates a thrust force, which
    pushes the cell body forward and which increases with the motor torque. We fix
    the rotating flagellum in space and show that it buckles under the thrust force
    at a critical motor torque. Buckling becomes visible as a supercritical Hopf bifurcation
    in the thrust force. A second buckling transition occurs at an even higher motor
    torque. We attach the flagellum to a spherical cell body and also observe the
    first buckling transition during locomotion. By changing the size of the cell
    body, we vary the necessary thrust force and thereby obtain a characteristic relation
    between the critical thrust force and motor torque. We present a sophisticated
    analytical model for the buckling transition based on a helical rod which quantitatively
    reproduces the critical force-torque relation. Real values for motor torque, cell
    body size, and the geometry of the helical filament suggest that buckling should
    occur in single bacterial flagella. We also find that the orientation of pulling
    flagella along the driving torque is not stable and comment on the biological
    relevance for marine bacteria.

  abstract: This paper is devoted to the permanence of the concept of Zero-Moment
    Point, widely-known by the acronym ZMP. Thirty-five years have elapsed since its
    implicit presentation (actually before being named ZMP) to the scientific community
    and thirty-three years since it was explicitly introduced and clearly elaborated,
    initially in the leading journals published in English. Its first practical demonstration
    took place in Japan in 1984, at Waseda University, Laboratory of Ichiro Kato,
    in the first dynamically balanced robot WL-10RD of the robotic family WABOT. The
    paper gives an in-depth discussion of source results concerning ZMP, paying particular
    attention to some delicate issues that may lead to confusion if this method is
    applied in a mechanistic manner onto irregular cases of artificial gait, i.e.
    in the case of loss of dynamic balance of a humanoid robot. After a short survey
    of the history of the origin of ZMP a very detailed elaboration of ZMP notion

  volume: '45'

  abstract: We introduce the concept of many-to-one mapping of form to function and
    suggest that this emergent property of complex systems promotes the evolution
    of physiological diversity. Our work has focused on a 4-bar linkage found in labrid
    fish jaws that transmits muscular force and motion from the lower jaw to skeletal
    elements in the upper jaws. Many different 4-bar shapes produce the same amount
    of output rotation in the upper jaw per degree of lower jaw rotation, a mechanical
    property termed Maxillary KT. We illustrate three consequences of many-to-one
    mapping of 4-bar shape to Maxillary KT. First, many-to-one mapping can partially
    decouple morphological and mechanical diversity within clades. We found with simulations
    of 4-bars evolving on phylogenies of 500 taxa that morphological and mechanical
    diversity were only loosely correlated (R(2) = 0.25). Second, redundant mapping
    permits the simultaneous optimization of more than one mechanical property of
    the 4-bar. Labrid fishes have capitalized on this flexibility, as illustrated
    by several species that have Maxillary KT = 0.8 but have different values of a
    second property, Nasal KT. Finally, many-to-one mapping may increase the influence
    of historical factors in determining the evolution of morphology. Using a genetic
    model of 4-bar evolution we exerted convergent selection on three different starting
    4-bar shapes and found that mechanical convergence only created morphological
    convergence in simulations where the starting forms were similar. Many-to-one
    mapping is widespread in physiological systems and operates at levels ranging
    from the redundant mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, up to the morphological
    basis of whole-organism performance. This phenomenon may be involved in the uneven
    distribution of functional diversity seen among animal lineages.

  abstract: Why do some animals swim by rowing appendages back and forth while others
    fly by flapping them up and down? One hypothesis suggests the answer lies in the
    sharply divergent physical environments encountered by small, slow animals, and
    large, fast animals. Flapping appendages allow large animals to move through a
    fluid environment quickly and efficiently. As size and speed decrease, however,
    viscous drag increasingly dominates the force balance, with negative consequences
    for both rowing and flapping appendages. Nevertheless, comparative data suggest
    that flapping does not occur in animals at Reynolds numbers (Re) less than about
    15. I used a computer simulation experiment to address the question, “Below what
    Re is rowing more effective than flapping?” The simulation, which employed a simple
    quasi-steady, blade-element model of virtual oscillating appendages, has several
    important results. First, the mechanical efficiency of both rowing and flapping
    decrease dramatically with scale. Second, the performance of rowing can increase
    substantially by taking advantage of several dynamic shape modifications, including
    area and span reduction during the recovery stroke. Finally, the relative performance
    of rowing and flapping is dependent on the advance ratio, which is a function
    of the travel speed relative to the oscillation frequency. The model predicts
    that rowing is more efficient than flapping at Re \< 20 for animals moving throughout
    the range of typically observed advance ratios.

  abstract: Interface designs are currently tested in a mixture of fidelities and
    media. So far, there is insufficient research to indicate what level of fidelity
    and media will produce the best feedback from users. This experiment compared
    user testing with low- and high-fidelity prototypes in both computer and paper
    media. Task-based user tests of sketched (low-fidelity) and HTML (high-fidelity)
    website prototypes were conducted in each medium, separating the testing medium
    from other factors of prototype fidelity. We found that low- and high-fidelity
    prototypes are equally good at uncovering usability issues. Usability testing
    results were also found to be independent of medium, despite differences in interaction
    style. Designers should choose whichever medium and level of fidelity suit their
    practical needs and design goals, as discussed in this paper.

  container-title: Journal of The Royal Society Interface
  publisher: The Royal Society
  page: 735-747
  volume: '6'
  issue: '38'
  abstract: Here, we present a detailed analysis of the wing kinematics and wing deformations
    of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria, Forskål) flying tethered in a wind tunnel.
    We filmed them using four high-speed digital video cameras, and used photogrammetry
    to reconstruct the motion of more than 100 identified points. Whereas the hindwing
    motions were highly stereotyped, the forewing motions showed considerable variation,
    consistent with a role in flight control. Both wings were positively cambered
    on the downstroke. The hindwing was cambered through an ’umbrella effect’ whereby
    the trailing edge tension compressed the radial veins during the downstroke. Hindwing
    camber was reversed on the upstroke as the wing fan corrugated, reducing the projected
    area by 30 per cent, and releasing the tension in the trailing edge. Both the
    wings were strongly twisted from the root to the tip. The linear decrease in incidence
    along the hindwing on the downstroke precisely counteracts the linear increase
    in the angle of attack that would otherwise occur in root flapping for an untwisted
    wing. The consequent near-constant angle of attack is reminiscent of the optimum
    for a propeller of constant aerofoil section, wherein a linear twist distribution
    allows each section to operate at the unique angle of attack maximizing the lift
    to drag ratio. This implies tuning of the structural, morphological and kinematic
    parameters of the hindwing for efficient aerodynamic force production.

    that can be attached to an actuator. We evaluate the stiffening of the five different
    prototypes, achieving an up to 8-fold increase in stiffness. The strength of the
    most effective prototype based on layer jamming is also validated in the context
    of pushing buttons, resulting in an 2.23-fold increase in pushing force.

  abstract: This note discusses multi-sensor fusion. Through sensor fusion we may
    combine readings from different sensors, remove inconsistencies and combine the
    information into one coherent structure. This kind of processing is a fundamental
    feature of all animal and human navigation, where multiple information sources
    such as vision, hearing and balance are combined to determine position and plan
    a path to a goal. While the concept of data fusion is not new, the emergence of
    new sensors, advanced processing techniques, and improved processing hardware
    make real-time fusion of data increasingly possible. Despite advances in electronic
    components, however, developing data processing applications such as automatic
    guidance systems has proved difficult. Systems that are in direct contact and
    interact with the real world, require reliable and accurate information about
    their environment. This information is acquired using sensors, that is devices
    that collect data about the world around them. The ability of one isolated device
    to provide accurate reliable data of its environment is extremely limited as the
    environment is usually not very well defined in addition to sensors generally
    not being a very reliable interface. Sensor fusion seeks to overcome the drawbacks
    of current sensor technology by combining information from many independent sources
    of limited accuracy and reliability to give information of better accuracy and
    reliability. This makes the system less vulnerable to failures of a single component
    and generally provide more accurate information. In addition several readings
    from the same sensor are combined, making the system less sensitive to noise and
    anomalous observations

  title: Animal Locomotion Controllers From Scratch
  container-title: Computer Graphics Forum
  page: 153-162
  volume: '32'
  issue: 2pt2
  abstract: There exists a large body of research devoted to creating real time interactive
    locomotion controllers which are targeted at some specific class of character,
    most often humanoid bipeds. Relatively little work, however, has been done on
    approaches which are applicable to creatures with a wide range of different forms
    – partially due to the lack of easily obtainable motion-capture data for animals
    and fictional creatures. We show how a locomotion controller can be created despite
    this dearth of data by synthesizing it from scratch. Our method only requires
    as input a description of the shape of the animal, the gaits which it can perform,
    and a model of the task or tasks for which the controller will be used. From this
    a sequence of motion clips are automatically synthesized and assembled into a
    motion graph which defines a physically realistic controller capable of performing
    the specified tasks. The method attempts to minimize the computational time required
    to generate this controller and we show its effectiveness at creating interactive
    controllers for a range of tasks for bipeds, tripeds, and quadrupeds.

  page: '1706695'
  volume: '30'
  issue: '13'
  abstract: Soft robots outperform the conventional hard robots on significantly enhanced
    safety, adaptability, and complex motions. The development of fully soft robots,
    especially fully from smart soft materials to mimic soft animals, is still nascent.
    In addition, to date, existing soft robots cannot adapt themselves to the surrounding
    environment, i.e., sensing and adaptive motion or response, like animals. Here,
    compliant ultrathin sensing and actuating electronics innervated fully soft robots
    that can sense the environment and perform soft bodied crawling adaptively, mimicking
    an inchworm, are reported. The soft robots are constructed with actuators of open-mesh
    shaped ultrathin deformable heaters, sensors of single-crystal Si optoelectronic
    photodetectors, and thermally responsive artificial muscle of carbon-black-doped
    liquid-crystal elastomer (LCE-CB) nanocomposite. The results demonstrate that
    adaptive crawling locomotion can be realized through the conjugation of sensing
    and actuation, where the sensors sense the environment and actuators respond correspondingly
    to control the locomotion autonomously through regulating the deformation of LCE-CB
    bimorphs and the locomotion of the robots. The strategy of innervating soft sensing
    and actuating electronics with artificial muscles paves the way for the development
    of smart autonomous soft robots.

    primitive features from the segmentedpatches. Finally, the modeling operations,
    such as solid booleansurface trimming operations, are performed to “assemble”
    thefeatures into the final model. The concepts of “feature”,“constraint” and “modeling

  abstract: — Automatic folding has drawn increasing attention in robotics research
    in the past ten years. The focus has been on folding two-dimensional (2D) sheets
    into three-dimensional (3D) structures, but little work has been done on how structures
    may be formed by folding ribbons. Here we propose the concept of robotic ribbon
    folding including a general workflow from shape design to ribbon folding and shape
    retention. We also propose a method to realize robotic ribbon folding on the macroscopic
    scale. The method consists of minimally engineered ribbons with patterned flexures,
    a folding robot, and a folding scheme that relates the orientation of flexures,
    the type of folds and the type of structural elements. By using this method we
    demonstrate robotic ribbon folding into 2D static structures such as triangles
    and squares, 3D static structures, and planar kinematic linkages such as a simple
    non-crossing four-bar mechanism. Burn-in result shows a four-bar mechanism with
    all bars’ length of 5 cm could move repeatedly for at least half an hour.

  abstract: OpenRoACH is a 15-cm 200-gram self-contained hexapedal robot with an onboard
    single-board computer. To our knowledge, it is the smallest legged robot with
    the capability of running the Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard. The robot
    is fully open sourced, uses accessible materials and off-the-shelf electronic
    components, can be fabricated with benchtop fast-prototyping machines such as
    a laser cutter and a 3D printer, and can be assembled by one person within two
    hours. Its sensory capacity has been tested with gyroscopes, accelerometers, Beacon
    sensors, color vision sensors, linescan sensors and cameras. It is low-cost within
    \$150 including structure materials, motors, electronics, and a battery. The capabilities
    of OpenRoACH are demonstrated with multi-surface walking and running, 24-hour
    continuous walking burn-ins, carrying 200-gram dynamic payloads and 800-gram static
    payloads, and ROS control of steering based on camera feedback. Information and
    files related to mechanical design, fabrication, assembly, electronics, and control
    algorithms are all publicly available on https://wiki.eecs.berkeley.edu/biomimetics/Main/OpenRoACH.

  abstract: Advances in materials and rapid prototyping technology, makes developing
    rapid-prototype heterogeneous parts possible. This paper proposes a finite element-based
    approach for modeling heterogeneous parts to facilitate rapid prototyping. In
    this approach, traditional geometrical and topological data are blended with materials
    information in the CAD model. It builds on a CAD system to create parts’ geometry
    which is then subdivided into a set of tetrahedral finite elements. With this,
    the design problem of material distribution in the whole body can be handled at
    the finite element level. The material composition of each point inside a finite
    element is formulated in terms of four control nodes of the finite element and
    a blending function. Moreover, design rules for modeling heterogeneous parts are
    introduced in the paper, making the modeling solution more robust. 2009 Elsevier

  abstract: Rapid response and strong mechanical properties are desired for smart
    materials used in soft actuators. A bioinspired hybrid hydrogel actuator was designed
    and prepared by series combination of three trunks of tough polymer-clay hydrogels
    to accomplish the comprehensive actuation of "extension-grasp-retraction" like
    a fishing rod. The hydrogels with thermo-creep and thermo-shrinking features were
    successively irradiated by near-infrared (NIR) to execute extension and retraction,
    respectively. The GO in the hydrogels absorbed the NIR energy and transformed
    it into thermo-energy rapidly and effectively. The hydrogel with adhesion or magnetic
    force was adopted as the "hook" of the hybrid hydrogel actuator for grasping object.
    The hook of the hybrid hydrogel actuator was replaceable according to applications,
    even with functional materials other than hydrogels. This study provides an innovative
    concept to explore new soft actuators through combining response hydrogels and
    programming the same stimulus.

  container-title: Soft Robotics
  publisher: Mary Ann Liebert Inc.
  page: 379-389
  volume: '4'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Soft pneumatic actuators and motor-based mechanisms being concomitant
    with the cumbersome appendages have many challenges to making the independent
    robotic system with compact and lightweight configuration. Meanwhile, shape memory
    actuators have shown a promising alternative solution in many engineering applications
    ranging from artificial muscle to aerospace industry. However, one of the main
    limitations of such systems is their inherent softness resulting in a small actuation
    force, which prevents them from more effective applications. This issue can be
    solved by combining shape memory actuators and the mechanism of stiffness modulation.
    As a first, this study describes a shape memory alloy-based soft gripper composed
    of three identical fingers with variable stiffness for adaptive grasping in low
    stiffness state and effective holding in high stiffness state. Each finger with
    two hinges is fabricated through integrating soft composite actuator with stiffness
    changeable material where each hinge can approximately achieve a 55-fold changeable
    stiffness independently. Besides, each finger with two hinges can actively achieve
    multiple postures by both selectively changing the stiffness of hinges and actuating
    the relevant SMA wire. Based on these principles, the gripper is applicable for
    grasping objects with deformable shapes and varying shapes with a large range
    of weight where its maximum grasping force is increased to ∼10 times through integrating
    with the stiffness changeable mechanism. The final demonstration shows that the
    finger with desired shape-retained configurations enables the gripper to successfully
    pick up a frustum-shaped object.

  abstract: Though there are significant efforts to develop numerical platforms to
    simulate the dynamic behaviors of responsive gels, several challenges were not
    successfully resolved, including truly robust method to handle time-dependent
    and coupled mass diffusion and deformation fields particularly at very short-time
    and complicated instability. In this Letter, a facile, robust and versatile finite
    element method was developed to resolve these challenges by adopting ramping boundary
    conditions, viscous damping, and damped Newton–Raphson method. This method can
    be readily implemented in a commercial platform COMSOL Multiphysics. The finite
    element method was showcased to study several dynamic examples that possess very
    short-time surface wrinkles, wrinkle evolutions, and incorporation with other
    physics field. Given the fact that the implementation is through a commercial
    platform, this method can have significant contributions to the studies of gels.

  abstract: The motion of an object to be manipulated is determined by the forces
    applied to the object. During a collision, impulsive forces may dominate all other
    forces, and determine the ultimate success or failure of a task. More effective
    planning and control of manipulators should be possible if the impact process,
    including the effects of friction and elasticity, is better understood. This paper
    explores the planar impact of two objects, and develops simple graphical methods
    for predicting the mode of contact, the total impulse, and the resultant motions
    of the objects. In the special case of a perfectly plastic collision, the fundamental
    motion of the object-whether an angular acceleration will occur, and if so in
    what direction-is the same as predicted in earlier work on quasi-static pushing.

    flight: Two-dimensional computations vs robotic wing experiments</span>'
  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 449-460
  volume: '207'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: We compare computational, experimental and quasi-steady forces in a generic
    hovering wing undergoing sinusoidal motion along a horizontal stroke plane. In
    particular, we investigate unsteady effects and compare two-dimensional (2D) computations
    and three-dimensional (3D) experiments in several qualitatively different kinematic
    patterns. In all cases, the computed drag compares well with the experiments.
    The computed lift agrees in the cases in which the sinusoidal changes in angle
    of attack are symmetrical or advanced with respect to stroke positions, but lags
    behind the measured 3D lift in the delayed case. In the range of amplitudes studied
    here, 3-5 chords, the force coefficients have a weak dependence on stroke amplitude.
    As expected, the forces are sensitive to the phase between stroke angle and angle
    of attack, a result that can be explained by the orientation of the wing at reversal.
    This dependence on amplitude and phase suggests a simple maneuver strategy that
    could be used by a flapping wing device. In all cases the unsteady forces quickly
    reach an almost periodic state with continuous flapping. The fluid forces are
    dominated by the pressure contribution. The force component directly proportional
    to the linear acceleration is smaller by a factor proportional to the ratio of
    wing thickness and stroke amplitude; its net contribution is zero in hovering.
    The ratio of wing inertia and fluid force is proportional to the product of the
    ratio of wing and fluid density and the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude;
    it is negligible in the robotic wing experiment, but need not be in insect flight.
    To identify unsteady effects associated with wing acceleration, and coupling between
    rotation and translation, as well as wake capture, we examine the difference between
    the unsteady forces and the estimates based on translational velocities, and compare
    them against the estimate of the coupling between rotation and translation, which
    have simple analytic forms for sinusoidal motions. The agreement and disagreement
    between the computed forces and experiments offer further insight into when the
    3D effects are important. A main difference between a 3D revolving wing and a
    2D translating wing is the absence of vortex shedding by a revolving wing over
    a distance much longer than the typical stroke length of insects. No doubt such
    a difference in shedding dynamics is responsible in part for the differences in
    steady state force coefficients measured in 2D and 3D. On the other hand, it is
    unclear whether such differences would have a significant effect on transient
    force coefficients before the onset of shedding. While the 2D steady state force
    coefficients underpredict 3D forces, the transient 2D forces measured prior to
    shedding are much closer to the 3D forces. In the cases studied here, the chord
    is moving between 3 to 5 chords, typical of hovering insect stroke length, and
    the flow does not appear to separate during each stroke in the cases of advanced
    and symmetrical rotation. In these cases, the wing reverses before the leading
    edge vortex would have time to separate even in 2D. This suggests that the time
    scale for flow separation in these strokes is dictated by the flapping frequency,
    which is dimensionally independent. In such cases, the 2D unsteady forces turn
    out to be good approximations of 3D experiments.

  abstract: We introduce Embodied Evolution (EE) as a new methodology for evolutionary
    robotics (ER). EE uses a population of physical robots that autonomously reproduce
    with one another while situated in their task environment. This constitutes a
    fully distributed evolutionary algorithm embodied in physical robots. Several
    issues identified by researchers in the evolutionary robotics community as problematic
    for the development of ER are alleviated by the use of a large number of robots
    being evaluated in parallel. Particularly, EE avoids the pitfalls of the simulate-and-transfer
    method and allows the speed-up of evaluation time by utilizing parallelism. The
    more novel features of EE are that the evolutionary algorithm is entirely decentralized,
    which makes it inherently scalable to large numbers of robots, and that it uses
    many robots in a shared task environment, which makes it an interesting platform
    for future work in collective robotics and Artificial Life. We have built a population
    of eight robots and successfully implemented the first example of Embodied Evolution
    by designing a fully decentralized, asynchronous evolutionary algorithm. Controllers
    evolved by EE outperform a hand-designed controller in a simple application. We
    introduce our approach and its motivations, detail our implementation and initial
    results, and discuss the advantages and limitations of EE. 2002 Elsevier Science

  abstract: Fast slip flow was identified for water inside the interlayer gallery

    flow rate enhancement (over two orders) breaks down with the presence of chemical
    functionalization and relaxation of nanoconfinement in graphene oxides. Molecular
    dynamics simulation results show that hydrodynamics applies in this circumstance,
    even at length scales down to nanometers. However, corrections to the slip boundary
    condition and apparent viscosity of nanoconfined flow must be included to make
    quantitative predictions. These results were discussed with the structural characteristics
    of liquid water and hydrogen-bond networks.

  volume: '33'
  abstract: Highly flexible soft robotic arms are safe for human-machine interaction.
    Particle Jamming has been demonstrated to be very effective for soft robotic arms
    with stiffness modulation by pneumatic means. However, the structural uncertainty
    due to particle re-organization makes particle jamming based soft robotic arms
    unreliable in both position and stiffness control. Ball joint based robotic arms
    have good structural integrity and good positional control property. Yet their
    stiffness modulation is very difficult. Instead of modulating stiffness using
    wires, this research proposes stiffness modulation of ball joint based robotic
    spines using vacuum energy. To strengthen the spine arm stiffness, particles are
    integrated into the ball joint spine. Both analysis and experimental studies in
    this research have shown that the integrated robotic spine has much better performance
    in terms of stiffness compared to the ball joint based spine without particle
    jamming. In fact, experimental studies have shown stiffness enhancement of 13
    times. The proposed soft robotic spine can be used in applications where a large

  container-title: Journal of neurophysiology
  page: 523-35
  volume: '92'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Because humans have limited ability to independently control the many
    joints of the hand, a wide variety of hand shapes can be characterized as a weighted
    combination of just two or three main patterns of covariation in joint rotations,
    or "postural synergies." The present study sought to align muscle synergies with
    these main postural synergies and to describe the form of membership of motor
    units in these postural/muscle synergies. Seventeen joint angles and the electromyographic
    (EMG) activities of several hand muscles (both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles)
    were recorded while human subjects held the hand statically in 52 specific shapes
    (i.e., shaping the hand around 26 commonly grasped objects or forming the 26 letter
    shapes of a manual alphabet). Principal-components analysis revealed several patterns
    of muscle synergy, some of which represented either coactivation of all hand muscles,
    or reciprocal patterns of activity (above and below average levels) in the intrinsic
    index finger and thumb muscles or (to a lesser extent) in the extrinsic four-tendoned
    extensor and flexor muscles. Single- and multiunit activity was generally a multimodal
    function of whole hand shape. This implies that motor-unit activation does not
    align with a single synergy; instead, motor units participate in multiple muscle
    synergies. Thus it appears that the organization of the global pattern of hand
    muscle activation is highly distributed. This organization mirrors the highly
    fractured somatotopy of cortical hand representations and may provide an ideal
    substrate for motor learning and recovery from injury.

  abstract: — Series-Elastic Actuators (SEA) have been proposed as a technology to
    build robust hu-manoid robots. The aim of this work is to generate effi-cient
    and robust walking for such robots. We present a combined approach which exploits
    the system dynam-ics through optimization based trajectory generation and a robust
    control scheme. The compliant actua-tor dynamics are explicitly modeled in the
    optimal control problem. For local stabilization, a passivity based tracking controller
    distributes the required con-trol forces onto the available contacts. Additionally,
    a predictive control scheme for step adaptation is presented, which provides feasible
    contact points in the future. Using a reduced model, this combines efficient walking
    with robustness against model or environment uncertainties and external disturbances.

  container-title: Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures
  page: 597-607
  volume: '19'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Environmentally responsive (ER) hydrogels are hydrogels that can experience
    an abrupt volume change and hence hold or release a large amount of water under
    the change of certain environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, or an
    electric field. Because of their unique capability to achieve a large yet reversible
    volume change, hydrogels have been widely used in microfluidics and biomedical
    applications, such as hydrogel sensors and actuators for microfluidic channels,
    novel drug delivery systems, and scaffolding materials for tissue engineering.
    In most applications, ER hydrogels are used to create an isotropic volume change
    or one-dimensional motion by constraining the hydrogel in the other two directions.
    In this study, using finite element based simulations, actuator designs are demonstrated
    that can generate a variety of shape changes by carefully patterning ER hydrogels
    on a non-ER hydrogel matrix. In these designs, as the environment changes, the
    ER hydrogels undergo volume change under the constraints imposed by the non-ER
    matrix, causing an eigenstrain (mismatch strain) and hence the deformation of
    the non-ER matrix. By properly controlling the locations of the ER hydrogel sections
    with respect to the non-ER hydrogel matrix, one can achieve a desired deformation
    of the composite structure. As examples, designs of a single material actuator,
    one linear spring composite actuator, and two coil composite actuators are demonstrated.
    The feasibility to produce these actuators and the possible applications are discussed
    at the end of the article.

  abstract: Planar, underactuated, biped walkers form an important domain of applications
    for hybrid dynamical systems. This paper presents the design of exponentially
    stable walking controllers for general planar bipedal systems that have one degree-of-freedom
    greater than the number of available actuators. The within-step control action
    creates an attracting invariant set-a two-dimensional zero dynamics submanifold
    of the full hybrid model-whose restriction dynamics admits a scalar linear time-invariant
    return map. Exponentially stable periodic orbits of the zero dynamics correspond
    to exponentially stabilizable orbits of the full model. A convenient parameterization
    of the hybrid zero dynamics is imposed through the choice of a class of output
    functions. Parameter optimization is used to tune the hybrid zero dynamics in
    order to achieve closed-loop, exponentially stable walking with low energy consumption,

  container-title: Integrative and comparative biology
  page: 378-89
  volume: '44'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: 'The evolution of feeding mechanisms in the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii)
    is a compelling example of transformation in a musculoskeletal complex involving
    multiple skeletal elements and numerous muscles that power skull motion. Biomechanical
    models of jaw force and skull kinetics aid our understanding of these complex
    systems and enable broad comparison of feeding mechanics across taxa. Mechanical
    models characterize how muscles move skeletal elements by pulling bones around
    points of rotation in lever mechanisms, or by transmitting force through skeletal
    elements connected in a linkage. Previous work has focused on the feeding biomechanics
    of several lineages of fishes, but a broader survey of skull function in the context
    of quantitative models has not been attempted. This study begins such a survey
    by examining the diversity of mechanical design of the oral jaws in 35 species
    of ray-finned fishes with three main objectives: (1) analyze lower jaw lever models
    in a broad phylogenetic range of taxa, (2) identify the origin and evolutionary
    patterns of change in the linkage systems that power maxillary rotation and upper
    jaw protrusion, and (3) analyze patterns of change in feeding design in the context
    of actinopterygian phylogeny. The mandibular lever is present in virtually all
    actinopterygians, and the diversity in lower jaw closing force transmission capacity,
    with mechanical advantage ranging from 0.04 to 0.68, has important functional
    consequences. A four-bar linkage for maxillary rotation arose in the Amiiformes
    and persists in various forms in many teleost species. Novel mechanisms for upper
    jaw protrusion based on this linkage for maxillary rotation have evolved independently
    at least five times in teleosts. The widespread anterior jaws linkage for jaw
    protrusion in percomorph fishes arose initially in Zeiformes and subsequently
    radiated into a wide range of premaxillary protrusion capabilities.'

  abstract: In this paper we describe the fabrication and testing of elastomer-based
    sensors capable of measuring both uniaxial strain and curvature. These sensors
    were fabricated from Sylgard 184, which is a transparent silicone elastomer. We
    created microchannels directly in silicone elastomer substrates using a laser
    to ablate material. The sensing element was an alloy of gallium and indium, which
    is liquid at room temperature, contained within the laser-created microchannels.
    As the substrate deformed, the microchannel deformed within it, resulting in a
    measurable change in electrical resistance. By fabricating two matching resistive
    strain-sensing elements on opposite sides of the sensor, we were able to unambiguously
    measure uniaxial strain and curvature by observing the common mode and differential
    mode changes in resistance, respectively. There was very little coupling between
    modes, demonstrating the utility of the differential sensor design. We characterized
    the sensor in terms of its response to strain and curvature, its noise, and its
    stability over time. We believe that this type of sensor has application in soft
    sensory skins and can observe pose in soft robotic systems.

  abstract: This paper presents a method for scaling down the size and scaling up
    the number of modules of self- re configurable systems by focusing on the actuation
    mechanism. Rather than developing smaller actuators, the main actuator is removed
    entirely. Energy instead comes from the environment to provide motion in prescribed
    synchronous ways. Prescribed synchronous motions allow much faster assembly times
    than random Brownian motion which has been used before. An instantiation of this
    idea is presented using a motion platform to induce motions based on the inertial
    properties of the modules and the timed actuation of small latching mechanisms.

  abstract: We describe a miniaturized infrared camera mounted on a remotely operated
    platform (burrow probe system) that we developed to investigate spotted hyena
    (Crocuta crocuta) cubs while still in their natal dens. In conjunction with the
    burrow probe system, we used a hook system to retrieve carcasses from within burrows.
    To test the utility of these systems, we compared results obtained using the burrow
    probe and hook to results obtained from intensive above-ground monitoring alone.
    With the probe, we documented births and litter sizes at significantly younger
    ages than with above-ground monitoring. The probe was instrumental in detecting
    cubs that died prior to emergence from the natal den. Retrieval of carcasses allowed
    collection of genetic samples and data on sex and cause of death. Thus, the burrow
    probe and hook systems can provide scientists and managers with empirical data
    on productivity and neonatal mortality of carnivores in the wild; data essential
    to accurately monitor and model population trends.

  container-title: Journal of Experimental Biology
  page: 2413-2432
  volume: '202'
  issue: '18'
  abstract: Pectoral tins are one of the major features of locomotor design in ray-tinned
    fishes and exhibit a well-documented phylogenetic transition from basal to derived
    clades. In percomorph fishes, the pectoral fins are often used to generate propulsive
    force via oscillatory movements, and pectoral fin propulsion in this relatively
    derived clade has been analyzed extensively. However, in the plesiomorphic pectoral
    fin condition, exemplified by sturgeon, pectoral fins extend laterally from the
    body in a generally horizontal orientation, have been assumed to generate lift
    to balance lift forces and moments produced by the heterocercal tail, and are
    not oscillated to generate propulsive force. The proposal that pectoral fins in
    fishes such as sturgeon generate lift during horizontal locomotion has never been
    tested experimentally in freely swimming fishes. In this paper, we examine the
    function of pectoral fins in sturgeon swimming at speeds from 0.5-3.0 L s-1, where
    L is total body length. Sturgeon were studied during steady horizontal locomotion
    as well as while sinking and rising in the water column. Pectoral fin function
    was quantified using three-dimensional kinematics to measure the orientation of
    the fin surface, digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) was used to describe
    flow in the wake of the fin and to estimate force exerted on the water, and electromyography
    was used to assess pectoral fin muscle function. Sturgeon (size range 25-32 cm
    total length) swam horizontally using continuous undulations of the body with
    a positive body angle that decreased from a mean of 20°at 0.5 L s-1 to 0°at 3.0
    L s-1. Both the angle of the body and the pectoral tin surface angle changed significantly
    when sturgeon moved vertically in the water column. Three-dimensional kinematic
    analysis showed that during steady horizontal swimming the pectoral fins are oriented
    with a negative angle of attack predicted to generate no significant lift. This
    result was confirmed by DPIV analysis of the pectoral fin wake, which only revealed
    fin vortices, and hence force generation, during maneuvering. The orientation
    of the pectoral fins estimated by a two-dimensional analysis alone is greatly
    in error and may have contributed to previous suggestions that the pectoral fins
    are oriented to generate lift. Combined electromyographic and kinematic data showed
    that the posterior half of the pectoral fin is actively moved as a flap to reorient
    the head and body to initiate rising and sinking movements. A new force balance
    for swimming sturgeon is proposed for steady swimming and vertical maneuvering.
    During steady locomotion, the pectoral fins generate no lift and the positive
    body angle to the flow is used both to generate lift and to balance moments around
    the center of mass. To initiate rising or sinking, the posterior portion of the
    pectoral fins is actively moved ventrally or dorsally, respectively, initiating
    a starting vortex that, in turn, induces a pitching moment reorienting the body
    in the flow. Adjustments to body angle initiated by the pectoral fins serve as
    the primary means by which moments are balanced.

    mechanics and the forces needed for excavation and traction</span>'
  container-title: Journal of Terramechanics
  page: 133-152
  volume: '44'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: There are many notional systems for excavating lunar regolith in NASA’s
    Exploration Vision. Quantitative system performance comparisons are scarce in
    the literature. This paper focuses on the required forces for excavation and traction
    as quantitative predictors of system feasibility. The rich history of terrestrial
    soil mechanics is adapted to extant lunar regolith parameters to calculate the
    forces. The soil mechanics literature often acknowledges the approximate results
    from the numerous excavation force models in use. An intent of this paper is to
    examine their variations in the lunar context. Six excavation models and one traction
    model are presented. The effects of soil properties are explored for each excavation
    model, for example, soil cohesion and friction, tool-soil adhesion, and soil density.
    Excavation operational parameters like digging depth, rake angle, gravity, and
    surcharge are examined. For the traction model, soil, operational, and machine
    design parameters are varied to probe choices. Mathematical anomalies are noted
    for several models. One conclusion is that the excavation models yield such disparate
    results that lunar-field testing is prudent. All the equations and graphs presented
    have been programmed for design use. Parameter ranges and units are included.

  container-title: Journal of neurophysiology
  page: 2447-58
  volume: '101'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Compared with rigid objects, grasping and lifting compliant objects presents
    additional uncertainties. For any static grasp, forces at the fingertips depend
    on factors including the locations of the contact points and the contact forces
    must be coordinated to maintain equilibrium. For compliant objects, the locations
    and orientations of the contact surfaces change in a force-dependent manner, thus
    changing the force requirements. Furthermore, every force adjustment then results
    in additional changes in object shape. This study characterized force and muscle
    activation patterns in this situation. Fingertip forces were measured as subjects
    grasped and lifted a 200-g object using their thumb, index, and ring fingers.
    A spring was sometimes placed under the index and/or ring finger contact surface.
    Surface electromyographic activity was recorded from ten hand muscles and one
    proximal arm muscle. The patterns of grip (normal) force and muscle activity were
    similar across conditions during the load and lift phases, but their amplitude
    depended on whether the contact surface was compliant. Specifically, the grip
    force increased smoothly during the load phase of the task under all conditions.
    To the contrary, the tangential contact (load) force did not increase monotonically
    when one or more of the contact surfaces were compliant, resulting in a decoupling
    of the grip and load forces.

  container-title: Bioinspiration & Biomimetics
  page: '036009'
  volume: '9'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: 'Estimates based on the strength, size, and shape of the Atlantic razor
    clam (Ensis directus) indicate that the animal’s burrow depth should be physically
    limited to a few centimeters; yet razor clams can dig as deep as 70 cm. By measuring
    soil deformations around burrowing E. directus, we have found the animal reduces
    drag by contracting its valves to initially fail, and then fluidize, the surrounding
    substrate. The characteristic contraction time to achieve fluidization can be
    calculated directly from soil properties. The geometry of the fluidized zone is
    dictated by two commonly-measured geotechnical parameters: coefficient of lateral
    earth pressure and friction angle. Calculations using full ranges for both parameters
    indicate that the fluidized zone is a local effect, occurring between 1-5 body
    radii away from the animal. The energy associated with motion through fluidized
    substrate-characterized by a depth-independent density and viscosity-scales linearly
    with depth. In contrast, moving through static soil requires energy that scales
    with depth squared. For E. directus, this translates to a 10X reduction in the
    energy required to reach observed burrow depths. For engineers, localized fluidization
    offers a mechanically simple and purely kinematic method to dramatically reduce
    energy costs associated with digging. This concept is demonstrated with RoboClam,
    an E. directus-inspired robot. Using a genetic algorithm to find optimal digging
    kinematics, RoboClam has achieved localized fluidization burrowing performance
    comparable to that of the animal, with a linear energy-depth relationship, in
    both idealized granular glass beads and E. directus’ native cohesive mudflat habitat.'

  page: 2072-2080
  volume: '215'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: Muscle measurements of Ensis directus, the Atlantic razor clam, indicate
    that the organism only has sufficient strength to burrow a few centimeters into
    the soil, yet razor clams burrow to over 70cm. In this paper, we show that the
    animal uses the motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding soil
    and reduce burrowing drag. Substrate deformations were measured using particle
    image velocimetry (PIV) in a novel visualization system that enabled us to see
    through the soil and watch E. directus burrow in situ. PIV data, supported by
    soil and fluid mechanics theory, show that contraction of the valves of E. directus
    locally fluidizes the surrounding soil. Particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled
    as a Newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction.
    Using these models, we demonstrate that E. directus is strong enough to reach
    full burrow depth in fluidized soil, but not in static soil. Furthermore, we show
    that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required
    to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static
    soil, and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than
    with depth squared.

  title: <span class="nocase">Identification and Evaluation of the Atlantic Razor
    Clam (Ensis directus) for Biologically Inspired Subsea Burrowing Systems</span>
  container-title: Integrative and Comparative Biology
  page: 151-157
  volume: '51'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'In this article, we identify and analyze a subsea organism to serve as
    a model for biologically inspired burrowing technology to be used in applications
    such as anchoring, installation of cables, and recovery of oil. After inspecting
    myriad forms of life that live on or within ocean substrates, the Atlantic razor
    clam, Ensis directis, stood out as an attractive basis for new burrowing technology
    because of its low-energy requirements associated with digging (0.21 J/cm), its
    speed and depth of burrrowing (∼1 cm/s and 70 cm, respectively), and its size
    and simplicity relative to man-made machines. As anchoring is a prime application
    for the technology resulting from this work, the performance of an Ensis directus-based
    anchoring system was compared to existing technologies. In anchoring force per
    embedment energy, the E. directus-based anchor beats existing technology by at
    least an order of magnitude. In anchoring force per weight of device, the biologically
    inspired system weighs less than half that of current anchors. The article concludes
    with a review of E. directus’s digging strategy, which involves motions of its
    valves to locally fluidize the substrate to reduce burrowing drag and energy,
    and the successful adaptation of E. directus’s burrowing mechanisms into an engineering
    system: the RoboClam burrowing robot, which, like the animal, uses localized fluidization
    to achieve digging energy that scales linearly with depth, rather than depth squared,
    for moving through static soil.'

    devices and machines with a high level of complexity. Tough hydrogels strongly
    attach, within seconds, to plastics, elastomers, leather, bone, and metals, reaching
    unprecedented interfacial toughness exceeding 2000 J/m 2 . Healing of severed
    ionic hydrogel conduc-tors becomes feasible and restores function instantly. Soft,

  volume: '27'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Only after injury, or perhaps prolonged exposure to cold that is sufficient
    to numb the fingers, do we suddenly appreciate the complex neural mechanisms that
    underlie our effortless dexterity in manipulating objects. The nervous system
    is capable of adapting grip forces to a wide range of object shapes, weights and
    frictional properties, to provide optimal and secure handling in a variety of
    potentially perturbing environments. The dynamic interplay between sensory information
    and motor commands provides the basis for this flexibility, and recent studies
    supply somewhat unexpected evidence of the essential role played by cutaneous
    feedback in maintaining and acquiring predictive grip force control. These examples
    also offer new insights into the adaptive control of other voluntary movements.

  page: 2303-2327
  volume: '202'
  issue: '17'
  abstract: We consider the motions and associated flow patterns of a swimming giant
    danio (Danio malabaricus). Experimental flow-visualization techniques have been
    employed to obtain the unsteady two-dimensional velocity fields around the straight-line
    swimming motions and a 60 °turn of the fish in the centerline plane of the fish
    depth. A three-dimensional numerical method is also employed to predict the total
    velocity field through simulation. Comparison of the experimental and numerical
    velocity and vorticity fields shows good agreement. The fish morphology, with
    its narrow peduncle region, allows for smooth flow into the articulated tail,
    which is able to sustain a large load for thrust generation. Streamlines of the
    flow detail complex processes that enhance the efficiency of flow actuation by
    the tail. The fish benefits from smooth nearbody flow patterns and the generation
    of controlled body-bound vorticity, which is propagated towards the tail, shed
    prior to the peduncle region and then manipulated by the caudal fin to form large-scale
    vortical structures with minimum wasted energy. This manipulation of body-generated
    vorticity and its interaction with the vorticity generated by the oscillating
    caudal fin are fundamental to the propulsion and maneuvering capabilities of fish.

  abstract: 'As the characteristic size of a flying robot decreases, the challenges
    for successful flight revert to basic questions of fabrication, actuation, fluid
    mechanics, stabilization, and power, whereas such questions have in general been
    answered for larger aircraft. When developing a flying robot on the scale of a
    common housefly, all hardware must be developed from scratch as there is nothing
    off-the-shelf’ which can be used for mechanisms, sensors, or computation that
    would satisfy the extreme mass and power limitations. This technology void also
    applies to techniques available for fabrication and assembly of the aeromechanical
    components: the scale and complexity of the mechanical features requires new ways
    to design and prototype at scales between macro and microeletromechanical systems,
    but with rich topologies and material choices one would expect when designing
    human-scale vehicles. With these challenges in mind, we present progress in the
    essential technologies for insect-scale robots, or pico’ air vehicles.'

  abstract: The ‘umbrella effect’, a mechanism of camber generation in the hindwing
    fans of orthopteroid and dictyopteroid insects, is modelled geometrically and
    mechanically, treating the fan as a framework whose outer margin describes a truncated
    logarithmic spiral. Tension in the margin compresses the radial veins, causing
    them to undergo Euler buckling. The model describes the distribution of compression
    forces in the veins around the spiral, and predicts conditions which must be met,
    and departures from the model expected in real wings. Actual insects fit the model
    and predictions quite well. The functional implications, and those of departure
    from the model, are discussed.

  abstract: We present a novel method for the modeling and optimization of the material
    distribution inside 3D shapes, such that their 3D printed replicas satisfy prescribed
    constraints regarding mass properties. In particular, we introduce an extension
    of ray-representation to shape interior modeling, and prove this parametrization
    covers the optimal interior regarding static and rotational stability criteria.
    This compact formulation thoroughly reduces the number of design variables compared
    to the general volumetric element-wise formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness
    of our reduced formulation for optimizing shapes that stably float in liquids
    or spin around a prescribed axis.

  abstract: Compliance is an important property in machine, but mechanism to realize
    compliance is not adequate to the demand. In this paper, the variable stiffness
    linkage (VSL) was designed to achieve safety assurance, stability improvement
    and energy conservation in robots and mechanical applications. Stiffness change
    could be realized by changing the position of the slider on each leaf spring.
    In order to save the energy from holding the specific stiffness, a screw-slider-linkage-slider
    mechanism was applied. Design principle and mechanical realization of VSL were
    presented. And then an effective stiffness model was designed. Finally the simulation
    was performed, which proved the effectiveness of VSL.

  abstract: '? 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.In
    this paper, we further explore multimodal locomotion via an updated robotic fish
    model based on Esox lucius. Besides the improved actuation properties like higher
    torque servomotors and powerful electronics, the robotic fish has some innovative
    mechanical design to pursue diverse swimming modes and superior performance. Specifically,
    we introduced a ?50? yawing head joint that functions as the neck for enhancing
    turning ability. A pair of pectoral mechanisms with two DOFs per fin is constructed
    to achieve 3-D swimming and to enrich multiple pectoral motions. At the control
    level, an improved central pattern generator (CPG) model allowing for free adjustment
    of the phase relationship among outputs is employed to produce rhythmic signals
    of multimodal swimming. Extensive experiments were carried out to examine how
    characteristic parameters in CPGs including amplitude, frequency, and phase lag
    affect the swimming performance. As a result, the robotic fish successfully performed
    various locomotion actions such as forward swimming, backward swimming, turning,
    diving, surfacing, as well as three pectoral motions in the form of pitching,
    heaving, and heaving-pitching. We found that small phase lag between oscillating
    joints which means large propulsive body wave length and undulation width could
    lead to a faster swimming in body and/or caudal fin (BCF) locomotion.'

  container-title: Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom
  page: 999-1015
  volume: '95'
  issue: '05'
  abstract: 'Cephalopods (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) play an important role as keystone
    invertebrates in various marine ecosystems, as well as being a valuable fisheries
    resource. At the World Malacological Congress, held 21–28 July 2013 in Ponta Delgada,
    Azores, Portugal, a number of cephalopod experts convened to honour the contribution
    of the late Malcolm R. Clarke, FRS (1930–2013) to cephalopod research. Endorsed
    by the Cephalopod International Advisory Council (CIAC), the meeting discussed
    some of the major challenges that cephalopod research will face in the future.
    These challenges were identified as follows: (1) to find new ways to ascertain
    the trophic role and food web links of cephalopods using hard tissues, stable
    isotopes and novel concepts in theoretical ecology; (2) to explore new approaches
    to the study of cephalopod morphology; (3) to further develop cephalopod aquaculture
    research; (4) to find new ways to ascertain cephalopod adaptation and response
    to environmental change; (5) to strengthen cephalopod genetics research; and (6)
    to develop new approaches for cephalopod fisheries and conservation. The present
    paper presents brief reviews on these topics, followed by a discussion of the
    general challenges that cephalopod research is bound to face in the near future.
    By contributing to initiatives both within CIAC and independent of CIAC, the principle
    aim of the paper is to stimulate future cephalopod research.'

  abstract: STEP-NC or ISO 14649 is the next generation of data models between CAD/CAM
    and CNC systems. After a decade of investigation, the STEP-NC technology is still
    under developed. The lack of a complete CAD/CAM/CNC prototype system with full
    bidirectional data flow hinders the improvement of STEP-NC. This paper proposes
    a complete CAD/CAM/CNC solution for STEP-compliant manufacturing, so as to explore
    the functionalities and emphases of STEP-NC technologies. Frameworks of individual
    CAD/CAM and CNC systems are illustrated in detail. Architectures of STEP-compliant
    CAD/CAM and CNC systems are studied and several criteria are summarized. Finally,
    this paper proposes a complete prototype STEP-compliant solution, which consists
    of a secondary developed STEP-compliant CAD/CAM system on the CATIA platform and
    an open structured STEP-compliant CNC system. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  title: Feedback Control For Cassie With Deep Reinforcement Learning
  container-title: 2018 ieee/rsj international conference on intelligent robots and
    systems (iros)
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 1241-1246
  abstract: Bipedal locomotion skills are challenging to develop. Control strategies
    often use local linearization of the dynamics in conjunction with reduced-order
    abstractions to yield tractable solutions. In these model-based control strategies,
    the controller is often not fully aware of many details, including torque limits,
    joint limits, and other non-linearities that are necessarily excluded from the
    control computations for simplicity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers
    a promising model-free approach for controlling bipedal locomotion which can more
    fully exploit the dynamics. However, current results in the machine learning literature
    are often based on ad-hoc simulation models that are not based on corresponding
    hardware. Thus it remains unclear how well DRL will succeed on realizable bipedal
    robots. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL using a realistic
    model of Cassie, a bipedal robot. By formulating a feedback control problem as
    finding the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process, we are able to learn
    robust walking controllers that imitate a reference motion with DRL. Controllers
    for different walking speeds are learned by imitating simple time-scaled versions
    of the original reference motion. Controller robustness is demonstrated through
    several challenging tests, including sensory delay, walking blindly on irregular
    terrain and unexpected pushes at the pelvis. We also show we can interpolate between
    individual policies and that robustness can be improved with an interpolated policy.

  title: <span class="nocase">Making burr puzzles from 3D models</span>
  container-title: ACM Transactions on Graphics
  page: '1'
  volume: '30'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: A 3D burr puzzle is a 3D model that consists of interlocking pieces with
    a single-key property. That is, when the puzzle is assembled, all the pieces are
    notched except one single key component which remains mobile. The intriguing property
    of the assembled burr puzzle is that it is stable, perfectly interlocked, without
    glue or screws, etc. Moreover, a burr puzzle consisting of a small number of pieces
    is still rather difficult to solve since the assembly must follow certain orders
    while the combinatorial complexity of the puzzle’s piece arrangements is extremely
    high. In this paper, we generalize the 6-piece orthogonal burr puzzle (a knot)
    to design and model burr puzzles from 3D models. Given a 3D input model, we first
    interactively embed a network of knots into the 3D shape. Our method automatically
    optimizes and arranges the orientation of each knot, and modifies pieces of adjacent
    knots with an appropriate connection type. Then, following the geometry of the
    embedded pieces, the entire 3D model is partitioned by splitting the solid while
    respecting the assembly motion of embedded pieces. The main technical challenge
    is to enforce the single-key property and ensure the assembly/disassembly remains
    feasible, as the puzzle pieces in a network of knots are highly interlocked. Lastly,
    we also present an automated approach to generate the visualizations of the puzzle
    assembly process.

  abstract: Complex three-dimensional (3D) structures in biology (e.g., cytoskeletal
    webs, neural circuits, and vasculature networks) formnaturally to provide essential
    functions in even the most basic forms of life. Compelling opportunities exist
    for analogous 3D architectures in human-made devices, but design options are constrained
    by existing capabilities in materials growth and assembly.We report routes to
    previously inaccessible classes of 3D constructs in advanced materials, including
    device-grade silicon.The schemes involve geometric transformation of 2D micro/nanostructures
    into extended 3D layouts by compressive buckling. Demonstrations include experimental
    and theoretical studies of more than 40 representative geometries, from single
    and multiple helices, toroids, and conical spirals to structures that resemble
    spherical baskets, cuboid cages, starbursts, flowers, scaffolds, fences, and frameworks,
    each with single- and/or multiple-level configurations. ontrolled

    density aware shape modelling meth to control the mass properties of 3D printed
    objects. We generat continuous density distribution that satisfies the given mass
    prop ties and generate a 3D printable model that represents this dens distribution
    using a truss structure. The number of nodes and th positions are iteratively
    optimized so as to minimize error betwe the target density and the density of
    the truss structure. With o technique, 3D printed objects that have desired mass
    properties c be fabricated.

  page: 1-26
  volume: '22'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: This paper presents a method of determining the approximate swept volume
    of Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces or solids. The method consists
    of (1) slicing the NURBS surfaces or solids by finding the intersection of plane/surface;
    (2) forming the sliced curves; (3) setting up the local moving coordinate system;
    (4) determining the characteristic (also called singular) points or curves by
    obtaining local maxima points at discrete frames during motion and with respect
    to a local moving coordinate system; (5) fitting each NURBS singular surface;
    (6) trimming the singular surfaces to obtain the boundary of the final approximate
    swept volumes by the surface/surface intersection and perturbation method. The
    local moving coordinate system is set up in reference to the motion direction
    of the rigid body as determined from its composite velocity vector. This work
    aims to develop a rigorous method for identifying and visualizing the approximate
    swept volume generated as a result of sweeping a NURBS surface or solid. The method
    and numerical algorithm are illustrated through examples. 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

  abstract: The generation of ideas is an essential element in the process of design.
    One suggested approach to improving the quality of ideas is through increasing
    their quantity. In this study, concept generation is examined via brainstorming,
    morphology charts and sketching. Statistically significant correlations were found
    between the quantity of brainstormed ideas and design outcome. In some, but not
    all, experiments, correlations were found between the quantity of morphological
    alternatives and design outcome. This discrepancy between study results hints
    at the role of project length and difficulty in design. The volume of dimensioned
    drawings generated during the early-to-middle phases of design were found to correlate
    with design outcome, suggesting the importance of concrete sketching, timing and
    milestones in the design process.

  abstract: 'This paper presents the development of the planar bipedal robot ERNIE

    framework serves as the basis for control of ERNIE’s walking. In the investigation
    of the effects of compliance on the energetic efficiency of walking, four cases

  page: 31-48
  volume: '25'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Fish, reptiles, and mammals can possess flexible dermal armor for protection.
    Here we seek to find the means by which Nature derives its protection by examining
    the scales from several fish (Atractosteus spatula, Arapaima gigas, Polypterus
    senegalus, Morone saxatilis, Cyprinius carpio), and osteoderms from armadillos,
    alligators, and leatherback turtles. Dermal armor has clearly been developed by
    convergent evolution in these different species. In general, it has a hierarchical
    structure with collagen fibers joining more rigid units (scales or osteoderms),
    thereby increasing flexibility without significantly sacrificing strength, in
    contrast to rigid monolithic mineral composites. These dermal structures are also
    multifunctional, with hydrodynamic drag (in fish), coloration for camouflage or
    intraspecies recognition, temperature and fluid regulation being other important
    functions. The understanding of such flexible dermal armor is important as it
    may provide a basis for new synthetic, yet bioinspired, armor materials.

  title: Stress Analysis In A Two Materials Joint With A Functionally Graded Material
  publisher: Woodhead Publishing Limited
  page: 41-46
  abstract: In this paper the stresses in a joint with a functionally graded material
    (FGM) are ana- lyzed. In the middle of a joint with FGM the stresses have been
    calculated analytically by using the plate theory. The effect of the thickness
    of the FGM layer and the effect of the transition function form on the stresses
    in the joint is discussed. Near the free edges of the interface in a joint with
    FGM, the stresses are described analytically by using the Mellin transform method.
    Some examples are presented to show the good agreement of the stresses calculated
    from FEM and with the analytical description in a joint with graded material.

  volume: '30'
  issue: '18'
  abstract: Hybrid ionically–covalently crosslinked double‐network (DN) hydrogels
    are attracting increasing attention on account of their self‐recovery ability
    and fatigue resistance, but their relative low mechanical strength and tedious
    performance adjustment severely limit their applications. Herein, a new strategy
    to concurrently fabricate hybrid ionic–covalent DN hydrogels and modulate their
    structures and mechanics is reported, in which an in situ formed chitosan ionic
    network is incorporated by post‐crosslinking the chitosan‐based composite hydrogel
    using multivalent anions solutions. The obtained hybrid DN hydrogels exhibit predominant
    mechanical properties including superior elastic modulus, high tensile strength,
    and ultrahigh fracture energy because of the more efficient energy dissipation
    of rigid short‐chain chitosan network. Notably, the swollen hydrogels still remain
    mechanically strong and tough even after immersion in water for 24 h. More significantly,
    simply changing the post‐crosslinking time can vary the compactness and rigidity
    of the chitosan network in situ, achieving flexible and efficient modulation of
    the structures and mechanics of the hybrid DN hydrogels. This study opens up a
    new horizon in the preparation and regulation of DN hydrogels for promising applications
    in tissue scaffolds, actuators, and wearable devices. Hybrid double‐network hydrogels
    are fabricated by a simple strategy and their structures and mechanics are modulated
    by incorporating an in situ formed chitosan ionic network via post‐crosslinking
    chitosan‐based composite hydrogels using multivalent anions solutions. This study
    opens up a new horizon in the preparation and regulation of stiff and tough hydrogels
    in load‐bearing applications.

  volume: '25'

  abstract: Novel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-clay (PNIPAM-clay) nanocomposite (NC)
    hydrogels with both excellent responsive bending and elastic properties are developed
    as temperature-controlled manipulators. The PNIPAM-clay NC structure provides
    the hydrogel with excellent mechanical property, and the thermoresponsive bending
    property of the PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogel is achieved by designing an asymmetrical
    distribution of nanoclays across the hydrogel thickness. The hydrogel is simply
    fabricated by a two-step photo polymerization. The thermoresponsive bending property
    of the PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogel is resulted from the unequal forces generated by
    the thermoinduced asynchronous shrinkage of hydrogel layers with different clay
    contents. The thermoresponsive bending direction and degree of the PNIPAM-clay
    NC hydrogel can be adjusted by controlling the thickness ratio of the hydrogel
    layers with different clay contents. The prepared PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogels exhibit
    rapid, reversible, and repeatable thermoresponsive bending/unbending characteristics
    upon heating and cooling. The proposed PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogels with excellent
    responsive bending property are demonstrated as temperature-controlled manipulators
    for various applications including encapsulation, capture, and transportation
    of targeted objects. They are highly attractive material candidates for stimuli-responsive
    smart soft robots in myriad fields such as manipulators, grippers, and cantilever
    sensors.

  volume: 2015-June
  abstract: In this paper, we present the design of a soft wearable exoskeleton that
    comprises of a glove embedded with pneumatic actuators of variable stiffness for
    hand assistive and rehabilitation application. The device is lightweight and easily
    wearable due to the usage of soft pneumatic actuators. A key feature of the device
    is the variable stiffness of the actuators at different localities that not only
    conform to the finger profile during actuation, but also provides customizability
    for different hand dimensions. The actuators can achieve different bending profiles
    with variable stiffness implemented at different localities. Therefore, the device
    is able to perform different hand therapy exercises such as full fist, straight
    fist, hook fist and table top. The device was characterized in terms of its range
    of motion and maximum force output. Experiments were conducted to examine the
    differences between active and passive actuation. The results showed that the
    device could achieve hand grasping and pinching with acceptable range of motion
    and force.

  abstract: We propose a whole finger manipulation (WFM) to improve the robustness
    of manipulation by a multifingered robot hand. The WFM is characterized by enveloping
    an object by finger links of the multifingered robot hand, and utilizing the frictionless
    sliding contacts between the surfaces of finger links and the grasped object.
    Therefore, the WFM can achieve a large manipulation without regrasping the object
    and can be highly robust in nature because of form-closure due to multiple contact
    points on the grasped object. This paper discusses the property and control of
    the WFM. The WFM with frictionless contact is shown to be a manipulable and force
    closure grasp using kinematics and statics with frictionless sliding contact.
    We discuss that the force closure for the WFM with frictionless contact can be
    viewed as form closure. An internal force-based impedance control is proposed
    for the stable manipulation in consideration of sliding contacts between the object
    and the finger links. A prototype hand and sensing systems are presented. The
    validity of the proposed control law is verified through the experiments.

  issue: April
  abstract: This work develops a method for controlling a robotic fish, as it swims
    in a school, by following periodic stimuli generated by a neighboring robot. To
    track the motion of a periodically oscillating neighboring source, the hydrodynamic
    pressure around the body of the robotic fish is measured by a PVDF sensor attached
    to the robot. The pressure induced by the source is obtained by subtracting the
    predicted pressure generated by the robotic fish from the measured pressure. The
    controlled fish tail mechanism is represented as an oscillator, and a moving oscillating
    sphere is considered to be an external source. A dipole model based on the potential
    flow theory is used to predict the hydrodynamic pressure close to the fish tail.
    The relative phase between the tail and the oscillating source is estimated from
    the pressure measurements of the PVDF sensor. The difference in phase angle between
    the tail and the oscillating source is used to determine the torque used to drive
    the tail mechanism. The proposed method is demonstrated by the tank experiments
    that involve a captured model of a robotic fish that swims close to an oscillating
    source.

  container-title: IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering
  publisher: IEEE
  page: 369-380
  volume: '43'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: IEEE This paper presents a method to control a robotic fish to swim along
    a straight wall by measuring nearby hydrodynamic pressure variations. This robotic
    fish is built for exhibiting in a museum, and is expected to swim back and forth
    along the boundary of an aquarium. Transparent glass walls of the aquarium are
    not easy to detect for the robotic fish using the optical camera. In nature, fish
    can detect pressure variations around their bodies to extract near-field information.
    This concept is adopted for a fish-like swimming mechanism. In this study, the
    tail of the robot is modeled as an oscillating dipole in a 2-D potential flow,
    and the wall effect is described by an image dipole on the opposite side of the
    wall. Based on this model, the distance and angle of the robot with respect to
    the wall are derived from the magnitudes and ratios of pressure variations measured
    by pressure sensors distributed on the head and the body of the robot. The pressure
    information is then fed back to control the orientation of the robot. Experimental
    results show that the robotic fish is able to swim with a distance-to-wall & \#x002F;tail-span
    ratio of 1-1.33 beside a wall. The wall effect decreases as the ratio increases.
    The proposed technique can be used to navigate a robotic fish with a close distance
    along a wall.

    types of hinged microstructures and the magnetic actuation process has been experimentally
    characterized. Under a given external magnetic field, the angular displacement
    of a hinged structure is determined by the volume of the magnetic material or
    by the stiffness of an auxiliary flexural loading spring. We have demonstrated
    parallel actuation of large arrays of hinged microstructures under a global (wafer
    scale) external magnetic field. The design rules for achieving a prescribed asynchronous
    actuation sequence among a group of microstructures have been determined to enable
    efficient parallel assembly of three-dimensional (3-D) microstructures

  abstract: Modular reconfigurable robots-experimental systems made by interconnecting
    multiple, simple, similar units-can perform shape shifting. A robot made up of
    a chain of simple hinge joints could shape itself into a loop and move by rolling
    like a self-propelled tank tread; then break open the loop to form a serpentine
    configuration and slither under or over obstacles; and then rearrange its modules
    to "morph" into a multilegged spider, able to stride over rocks and bumpy terrain.
    This robot, dubbed PolyBot, is being built and experimented with at Xerox Palo
    Alto Research Center (PARC), in California. This paper describes the main features
    of PolyBot and how it works. Programming of PolyBot is also discussed

    Their promise of high versatility, high value, and high robustness may lead to
    a radical change in automation. Currently, a number of researchers have been addressing
    many of the challenges. While some progress has been made, it is clear that many
    challenges still exist. By illustrating several of the outstanding issues as grand
    challenges that have been collaboratively written by a large number of researchers

  abstract: The field of modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems addresses the
    design, fabrication, motion planning, and control of autonomous kinematic machines
    with variable morphology. Beyond conventional actuation, sensing, and control
    typically found in fixed-morphology robots, self-reconfigurable robots are also
    able to deliberately change their own shape by rearranging the connectivity of
    their parts in order to adapt to new circumstances, perform new tasks, or recover
    from damage. Over the last two decades, this field has advanced from proof-of-concept
    systems to elaborate physical implementations and simulations. The goal of this
    article is to outline some of this progress and identify key challenges and opportunities
    that lay ahead.

  title: Variable Stiffness Structures Utilizing Fluidic Flexible Matrix Composites

  publisher: 'SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England'
  page: 443-456
  volume: '20'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: In this research, the capability of utilizing fluidic flexible matrix
    composites (F2MC) for autonomous structural tailoring is investigated. By taking
    advantage of the high anisotropy of flexible matrix composite (FMC) tubes and
    the high bulk modulus of the pressurizing fluid, significant changes in the effective
    modulus of elasticity can be achieved by controlling the inlet valve to the fluid-filled
    F2MC structure. The variable modulus F2MC structure has the flexibility to easily
    deform when desired (open-valve), possesses the high modulus required during loading
    conditions when deformation is not desired (closed-valve ĝ€" locked state), and
    has the adaptability to vary the modulus between the flexible/stiff states through
    control of the valve. In the current study, a 3D analytical model is developed
    to characterize the axial stiffness behavior of a single F2MC tube. Experiments
    are conducted to validate the proposed model, and the test results show good agreement
    with the model predictions. A closed/open modulus ratio as high as 56 times is
    achieved experimentally. With the validated model, an F2MC design space study
    is performed. It is found that by tailoring the properties of the FMC tube and
    inner liner, a wide range of moduli and modulus ratios can be attained. By embedding
    multiple F 2MC tubes side by side in a soft matrix, a multi-cellular F 2MC sheet
    with a variable stiffness in one direction is constructed. The stiffness ratio
    of the multi-cellular F2MC sheet obtained experimentally shows good agreement
    with a model developed for this type of structure. A case study has been conducted
    to investigate the behavior of laminated \[+60/0/-60\]s multi-cellular F2MC sheets.
    It is shown that the laminate can achieve tunable, steerable, anisotropy by selective
    valve control. SAGE Publications 2009.

  abstract: To obtain a good approximation for data fitting with a spline, frequently
    we have to deal with knots as variables. The problem to be solved then becomes
    a continuous nonlinear and multivariate optimization problem with many local optima.
    Therefore, it is difficult to obtain the global optimum. In this paper, we propose
    a method for solving this problem by using a real-coded genetic algorithm. Our
    method can treat not only data with a smooth underlying function, but also data
    with an underlying function having discontinuous points and/or cusps. We search
    for the best model among candidate models by using the Bayes Information Criterion
    (BIC). With this, we can appropriately determine the number and locations of knots
    automatically and simultaneously. Five examples of data fitting are given to show
    the performance of our method. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Motion structures are assemblies of resistant bodies connected by movable
    joints. Unlike conventional structures, they are designed to contain internal
    mobilities that allow large shape transformations to satisfy practical requirements.
    Their applications range from satellite solar panels and space antennas to shelters,
    exhibition stands, and medical implants. We introduce the characteristics of motion
    structures, the principles used to create such structures, and their applications.
    This brief survey is based on the latest research in this thriving field. ?? 2007

  abstract: Insect wings are complex structures that deform dramatically in flight.
    We analyzed the aerodynamic consequences of wing deformation in locusts using
    a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation based on detailed
    wing kinematics. We validated the simulation against smoke visualizations and
    digital particle image velocimetry on real locusts. We then used the validated
    model to explore the effects of wing topography and deformation, first by removing
    camber while keeping the same time-varying twist distribution, and second by removing
    camber and spanwise twist. The full-fidelity model achieved greater power economy
    than the uncambered model, which performed better than the untwisted model, showing
    that the details of insect wing topography and deformation are important aerodynamically.
    Such details are likely to be important in engineering applications of flapping
    flight.

  container-title: Journal of Anatomy
  page: 165-174
  volume: '202'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: It has been proposed that the hominid lineage began when a group of chimpanzee-like
    apes began to throw rocks and swing clubs at adversaries, and that this behaviour
    yielded reproductive advantages for millions of years, driving natural selection
    for improved throwing and clubbing prowess. This assertion leads to the prediction
    that the human hand should be adapted for throwing and clubbing, a topic that
    is explored in the following report. It is shown that the two fundamental human
    handgrips, first identified by J. R. Napier, and named by him the ’precision grip’
    and ’power grip’, represent a throwing grip and a clubbing grip, thereby providing
    an evolutionary explanation for the two unique grips, and the extensive anatomical
    remodelling of the hand that made them possible. These results are supported by
    palaeoanthropological evidence.

  volume: '34'

  abstract: This paper is concerned with the design of a robotic fish and its motion
    control algorithms. A radio-controlled, four-link biomimetic robotic fish is developed
    using a flexible posterior body and an oscillating foil as a propeller. The swimming
    speed of the robotic fish is adjusted by modulating joint’s oscillating frequency,
    and its orientation is tuned by different joint’s deflections. Since the motion
    control of a robotic fish involves both hydrodynamics of the fluid environment
    and dynamics of the robot, it is very difficult to establish a precise mathematical
    model employing purely analytical methods. Therefore, the fish’s motion control
    task is decomposed into two control systems. The online speed control implements
    a hybrid control strategy and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control
    algorithm. The orientation control system is based on a fuzzy logic controller.
    In our experiments, a point-to-point (PTP) control algorithm is implemented and
    an overhead vision system is adopted to provide real-time visual feedback. The
    experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. 2004

    In centralized learning, every robot runs the same controller and the performance

  volume: '21'

  abstract: '1996-2012 IEEE. This paper deals with a novel fast swimming robotic fish
    capable of high maneuverability and yet with less joints. On the basis of prior
    work on a single-motor-actuated miniature robotic fish, we mainly stress three
    aspects: mechanical design, motion analysis, and posture control to strike a tradeoff
    between speediness and maneuverability. Specifically, an improved mechanical structure
    endows the robot with large thrust and increased range of movements. Motion analysis
    offers useful guidance to parameter settings of steady swimming. Besides, sine-based
    functions responsible for generating traveling waves in conjunction with an analysis
    of parameter variation of oscillation amplitude of the fish tail serve the purpose
    to determine the posture of the robotic fish. Underwater tests on straight swimming
    and different turns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and
    mechatronic designs. Remarkably, the robot attained a maximum swimming speed of
    1.14 m/s (corresponding to 3.07 body lengths per second) in forward swimming,
    a turning rate of approximately 90 °/s in normal turns, and a turning rate of
    approximately 63.8 °/s in hybrid turns.'

  volume: '29'
  abstract: Analytic elasticity solutions for laminated composite cylindrical shells
    under cylindrical bending are presented. The material of the shell is assumed
    to be general cylindrically anisotropic. Based on the theory of cylindrical anisotropic
    elasticity, coupled governing partial differential equations are developed. The
    general expressions for the stresses and displacements in the laminated composite
    cylinders are discussed. The closed form solutions based on Classical Shell Theory
    (CST) and Donnell’s (1933) theory are also derived for comparison purposes. Three
    examples illustrate the effect of radius-to-thickness ratio, coupling and stacking
    sequence. The results show that, in general, CST yields poor stress and displacement
    distributions for thick-section composite shells, but converges to the exact elasticity
    solution as the radius-to-thickness ratio increases. It is also shown that Donnell’s
    theory significantly underestimates the stress and displacement response.

  volume: '17'

  abstract: Skeletal muscles transform neural control signals into forces that act
    upon the body segments to effect a coordinated motor task. This transformation
    is complex, not only because the properties of muscles are complex, but because
    the tendon affects the transmission of muscle force to the skeleton. This review
    focuses on how to synthesize basic properties of muscle and tendon to construct
    models applicable to studies of coordination. After a review of the properties
    of muscle and tendon, their integrated ability to generate force statically and
    dynamically is studied by formulating a generic model of the "musculotendon actuator",
    which has only one parameter, the ratio of tendon length at rest to muscle fiber
    length at rest. To illustrate the utility of the model, it is analyzed to show
    how this one parameter specifies whether excitation-contraction or musculotendon
    contraction is the rate-limiting process of force generation, whether elastic
    energy is stored in tendon or muscle, and whether hip- and knee-extensor actuators
    function as springs or dashpots during walking.

  page: 316-325
  volume: '13'

  abstract: In this study, I utilize the expected functional relationships between
    claw and toe morphology and clinging performance as a basis for examining evolutionary
    trends across 85 lizard taxa from 13 families. After controlling for body size
    and phylogeny, multivariate comparisons indicate that several aspects of claw
    and toe morphology are correlated with clinging performance. Specifically, evolutionary
    increases in claw curvature, toe width and adhesive lamella number are correlated
    with increases in clinging performance on smooth substrates. Furthermore, evolutionary
    increases in claw height and decreases in toe length are correlated with increases
    in clinging performance on rough substrates. Sensitivity analyses revealed that
    changes in both branch lengths and procedural order of correction for body size
    and phylogeny do not generally have an effect on phylogenetic comparisons. These
    results demonstrate that the evolution of claw and toe morphology is correlated
    with the evolution of clinging performance across a wide range lizard taxa.

  abstract: In this work we analyze the cost of transport of in-plane hexapedal robots.
    The robots are modeled as a rigid body with six massless legs, each having two
    compliant degrees of freedom and the contact is modeled using Coulomb’s model.
    We start our analysis by formulating the cost of transport for rigid legged robots
    as a function of their geometry, friction coefficients, actuation velocities and
    slope angle and compare it to the results of a dynamic multibody numeric simulation.
    In the second part, we estimate the cost of transport in the more general case
    when the legs and surface are compliant. We evaluate the energy consumptions factors,
    sliding, work against gravity, elastic losses of the legs and the surface, and
    kinetic energy and compare them to the total energy input of the actuators. This
    analysis allows us to evaluate the work range of the robots and determine the
    optimum locomotion paths for improved battery performance.

  page: 3093-3098
  abstract: This paper proposes a novel dynamic gait of locomotion for hexapedal robots
    which enables them to crawl forward, backward, and rotate using a single actuator.
    The gait exploits the compliance difference between the two sides of the tripods,
    to generate clockwise or counter clockwise rotation by controlling the acceleration
    of the robot. The direction of turning depends on the configuration of the legs
    -tripod left of right- and the direction of the acceleration. Alternating acceleration
    in successive steps allows for continuous rotation in the desired direction. An
    analysis of the locomotion is presented as a function of the mechanical properties
    of the robot and the contact with the surface. A numerical simulation was performed
    for various conditions of locomotion. The results of the simulation and analysis

  abstract: 2015 SPIE. Minimally-actuated palm-size robots are capable of running
    at speeds greater than 2 meters per second (20 body lengths per second), with
    leg stride rates of greater than 20 Hz. In this dynamic regime, passive stabilization
    is needed for roll-and-pitch instability. However, we have found that certain
    roll-oscillation modes can be used for continuous high speed turning. Other continuous
    turning modes have also been identified, such as modulating foot contact location
    through foot compliance, and controlling differential leg velocity. For the small
    minimallyactuated robots examined, the dynamically enhanced roll-steer mode showed
    the best turning rate, of over 8 degrees per step, but only appears at certain
    running frequencies. Interstride phase and velocity control appears promising
    as a mode for in-plane maneuverability for under-actuated robots.

  page: 20-25
  abstract: This paper presents a six-legged, sprawl-tuned autonomous robot (STAR).
    This novel robot has a variable leg sprawl angle in the transverse plane to adapt
    its stiffness, height, and leg-to-surface contact angle. The sprawl angle can
    be varied from nearly positive 60 degrees to negative 90 degrees, enabling the
    robot to run in a planar configuration, upright, or inverted (see movie). STAR
    is fitted with spoke wheel-like legs which provide high electromechanical conversion
    efficiency and enable the robot to achieve legged performance over rough surfaces
    and obstacles, using a high sprawl angle, and nearly wheel-like performance over
    smooth surfaces for small sprawl angles. Our model and experiments show that the
    contact angle and normal contact forces are substantially reduced when the sprawl
    angle is low, and the velocity increases over smooth surfaces, with stable running
    at all velocities up to 5.2m/s and a Froude number of 9.8.

  abstract: Origami has been employed to build deployable mechanical metamaterials
    through folding and unfolding along the crease lines. Deployable metamaterials
    are usually flexible, particularly along their deploying and collapsing directions,
    which unfortunately in many cases leads to an unstable deployed state, i.e., small
    perturbations may collapse the structure along the same deployment path. Here
    we create an origami-inspired mechanical metamaterial with on-demand deployability
    and selective collapsibility through energy analysis. This metamaterial has autonomous
    deployability from the collapsed state and can be selectively collapsed along
    two different paths, embodying low stiffness for one path and substantially high
    stiffness for another path. The created mechanical metamaterial yields load-bearing
    capability in the deployed direction while possessing great deployability and
    collapsibility. The principle in this work can be utilized to design and create
    versatile origami-inspired mechanical metamaterials that can find many applications.

  abstract: Robotic origami allows rapid prototyping of intelligent robots and machines
    constructed from thin sheets of functional materials. Multimaterial-based design
    freedom of origami robots creates functional versatility; however, the design
    parameters pose challenges in their mechanical layout and fabrication. While the
    conventional robot design follows a coherent and well-established design process,
    the construction of origami robots requires close study of their three-dimensional
    (3-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) geometries, compliant mechanisms, functional material
    specific components, and 2-D fabrication methods. In this paper, we report a systematic
    design methodology for building origami-inspired machines and robots based on
    these four essential design features. We provide their comprehensive formulation,
    comparing them to conventional robots and highlighting design challenges as well
    as potentials. We demonstrate the applicability of our procedure to the majority
    of origami robots in the literature and also validate it by designing a centimeter-scale
    jumping and crawling origami robot, Tribot, as a showcase. The 6-g Tribot crawls
    with fixed steps in a closed loop, adjusts its vertical jumping height by power
    modulation, and overcomes obstacles of 45-mm height by side jumps. This paper
    advances the design and fabrication methodology of origami robots, with customizable
    functionality from the ground-up.

    Open-source 3-D printers have proven useful for fabricating scientific tools.
    Here the capabilities of an open-source 3-D printer are expanded to become a highly
    flexible scientific platform. An automated low-cost 3-D motion control platform
    is presented that has the capacity to perform scientific applications, including
    (1) 3-D printing of scientific hardware; (2) laboratory auto-stirring, measuring,
    and probing; (3) automated fluid handling; and (4) shaking and mixing. The open-source
    3-D platform not only facilities routine research while radically reducing the
    cost, but also inspires the creation of a diverse array of custom instruments
    that can be shared and replicated digitally throughout the world to drive down
    the cost of research and education further.

    We then address the critical issue of how to model the state of contact in terms
    that are both sufficient for defining general contacts and conducive to bridging
    the gap between a robot task description and the information observable by a tactile
    sensor. We subsequently examine techniques for deriving tactile sensor models
    that are required for computing the state of contact from the sensor output. Two
    basic methods for mapping a tactile sensor image to the contact state variables
    are introduced: one based on explicit inverse modeling, and the other on numerical
    tactile Jacobian. In both cases, moments of the tactile sensor image are used
    as the features that capture the necessary information about contact. The theoretical
    development is supported by extensive experiments, which include edge tracking,

  abstract: Soft robotics is an emerging field with strong potential to serve as an
    educational tool due to its advantages such as low costs and shallow learning
    curves. In this paper, we introduce a modular and reconfigurable mold for flexible
    design of pneumatic soft robotic grippers. By using simple assembly kits, students
    at all levels are able to design and construct soft robotic grippers that vary
    in function and performance. The process of constructing the modular mold enables
    students to understand how design choices impact system performance. Our unique
    modular mold allows students to select the number and length of fingers in a gripper,
    as well as to adjust the internal geometry of the pneumatic actuator cavity, which
    dictates how and where bending of a finger occurs. In addition, the mold may be
    deconstructed and reconfigured, which allows for fast iterative design and lowers
    material costs (since a new mold does not need to be made to implement a design
    change). We further demonstrate the feasibility of the modular mold by implementing
    it in a soft robot design activity in classrooms and showing a sufficiently high
    rate of student success in designing and constructing a functional soft robotic
    gripper.

  abstract: This paper presents the design of a jumping robot inspired by jumping
    locomotion of locusts. The mechanisms of jumping, self-righting, steering, and
    takeoff angle adjusting are modeled and simulated firstly. Then the 3D model of
    the robot is designed and a prototype of the robot is fabricated. An eccentric
    cam with quick return characteristics is used by the jumping mechanism to compress
    torsion springs for energy storing and to trigger the springs for a quick release
    of energy. The self-righting, steering, and takeoff angle adjusting capabilities
    of the robot are achieved by adding a rotatable pole leg. The pole leg can prop
    up the body of the robot when it falls down. The pole leg can also steer the robot
    to turn step by step. By adjusting its center of mass (COM) using the pole leg
    with an additional weight, the robot can jump at different takeoff angles. A 9cm×7cm×12cm,
    154g jumping robot prototype is implemented. The fundamental characteristics of
    the robot are tested. Experimental results show that the constructed robot can
    jump more than 88cm high at a takeoff angle of 80.33°. The robot rotates about
    277° in the air during jumping. The robot can self-right when it falls down to
    its left, right, and front sides in 9s, 9s, and 26s respectively. The robot can
    steer 360° in 42s with 14 steps, about 25.7° per step. Its takeoff angle ranges
    between 80.33° and 86.92°. The robot can continuously jump to overcome stairs
    and jump forward in outdoor environments with self-righting and steering. The
    experimental results are compared with the simulation results. The differences
    between them are explained.

  abstract: Flying insects and swimming fishes have high efficiency and high maneuverability
    in air and water, respectively. Their wings and fins have evolved for many ages
    to adapt to propelling in the complex environment. In this paper, an integrative
    biomimetic robotic fish is proposed and developed, which combines the advantages
    of insect wings and fish fins to achieve a high agility underwater. In the robotic
    fish, two caudal fins were equipped at the tail of the robotic fish in parallel
    as the main propulsion mechanism, the opposite flapping of the two caudal fins
    generates mutually opposing lateral forces during cruising, which leads to a stable
    and high-performance swimming. In addition, two pectoral fins that mimic the function
    of insect wings were equipped at two sides of the robotic fish, which enhances
    the robotic fish maneuverability in vertical plane. Moreover, a central pattern
    generator model was designed to achieve the versatile maneuvering motions, motion
    switching, and autonomous swimming with an obstacle avoiding ability. The experiments
    have demonstrated that the robotic fish can swim more stably and efficiently with
    versatile maneuver motions by taking advantage of the integrative propulsion mechanism.
    The developed robotic fish have many potential applications for its agility, stable
    swimming, and low-cost structure.

  abstract: In this paper, a wireless human motion monitoring system is presented
    for gait analysis and visual feedback in rehabilitation training. The system consists
    of several inertial sensors and a pair of smart shoes with pressure sensors. The
    inertial sensors can capture lower-extremity joint rotations in three dimensions
    and the smart shoes can measure the force distributions on the two feet during
    walking. Based on the raw measurement data, gait phases, step lengths, and center
    of pressure (CoP) are calculated to evaluate the abnormal walking behaviors. User
    interfaces are developed on both laptops and mobile devices to provide visual
    feedback to patients and physical therapists. The system has been tested on healthy
    subjects and then applied in a clinical study with 24 patients. It has been verified
    that the patients are able to understand the intuitive visual feedback from the
    system, and similar training performance has been achieved compared to the traditional
    gait training with physical therapists. The experimental results with one healthy
    subject, one stroke patient, and one Parkinson’s disease patient are compared
    to demonstrate the performance of the system.

  page: 997-1002
  abstract: This paper represents a bio-inspired trajectory generation (path planning)
    method for UAV perching. The method is based on the tau theory which was established
    from studying the natural motion behaviors when animals (including humans) approaching
    and catching a fixed or moving object. In our research, the tau theory is applied
    to the trajectory generation problem of a UAV perching on a target object. Two
    perching scenarios have been studied, one from a flight state (with non-zero initial
    velocity) and one from a hovering state (with zero initial velocity). Three strategies,
    namely, perching with a straight-line trajectory, perching with pitch angle coupling,
    and perching with pitch/yaw angular coupling, are demonstrated with each of the
    two scenarios. The simulation results show that the resulting flight trajectories
    meet all the desired requirements for a rotary UAV to perch on an object.

  page: 878-883
  abstract: Based on the underactuated mechanism and coupling principle, a five-fingered
    prosthetic hand is presented in this paper. The design of the finger is based
    on two types of four-bar linkage mechanisms. One is the underactuated linkage
    mechanism, which implements self-adapt grasp with wide variety of objects placed
    between base joint and middle joint. The other is the coupling linkage which employs
    between the middle and distal joints. The thumb, the index finger and other three
    fingers are actuated by a motor respectively. The multi-DOF hand is comprised
    of 13 joints and driven by three motors. Torque and position sensors are integrated
    into the fingers. The control system is based on two DSP processing boards. One
    implements the motion pattern classifier of the hand based on the EMG signals
    through two electrodes. The other implements the position and torque control of
    the fingers. All actuators, sensors and electronic boards are embedded into the
    hand, which presents a highly integrated mechatronics system. Grasping experiments
    demonstrate that this prosthetic hand has the high grasping capability and dexterity.

  abstract: A miniature robot with continuous jumping ability is presented in this
    paper. The robot has a dimension about 6cm×8cm×2cm and weighs 20 grams. To achieve
    continuous jumping, various mechanisms are needed including the jumping mechanism,
    energy store and release mechanism, self-righting mechanism, and jumping direction
    changing mechanism. The design and analysis for those mechanisms are elaborated
    in this paper. Moreover, implementation and experimental results are also presented.
    It is shown that the robot can jump higher than 55cm with a 75° takeoff angle.
    The robot can be used as mobile sensors and deployed in the areas of rugged terrain
    and natural obstacles which are not suitable for sensors with wheels. 2011 IEEE.

  title-short: MSU Jumper
  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Robotics
  page: 602-614
  volume: '29'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: The ability to jump is found widely among small animals such as frogs,
    grasshoppers, and fleas. They jump to overcome large obstacles relative to their
    small sizes. Inspired by the animals’ jumping capability, a miniature jumping
    robot-Michigan State University (MSU) Jumper-has been developed. In this paper,
    the mechanical design, fabrication, and experimentation of the MSU jumper are
    presented. The robot can achieve the following three performances simultaneously,
    which distinguish it from the other existing jumping robots. First, it can perform
    continuous steerable jumping that is based on the self-righting and the steering
    capabilities. Second, the robot only requires a single actuator to perform all
    the functions. Third, the robot has a light weight (23.5 g) to reduce the damage
    that results from the impact of landing. Experimental results show that, with
    a 75° take-off angle, the robot can jump up to 87 cm in vertical height and 90
    cm in horizontal distance. The robot has a wide range of applications such as
    sensor/communication networks, search and rescue, surveillance, and environmental
    monitoring.

  container-title: Journal of the Royal Society Interface
  page: 485-497
  volume: '7'
  issue: '44'
  abstract: Recent work on the aerodynamics of flapping flight reveals fundamental
    differences in the mechanisms of aerodynamic force generation between fixed and
    flapping wings. When fixed wings translate at high angles of attack, they periodically
    generate and shed leading and trailing edge vortices as reflected in their fluctuating
    aerodynamic force traces and associated flow visualization. In contrast, wings
    flapping at high angles of attack generate stable leading edge vorticity, which
    persists throughout the duration of the stroke and enhances mean aerodynamic forces.
    Here, we show that aerodynamic forces can be controlled by altering the trailing
    edge flexibility of a flapping wing. We used a dynamically scaled mechanical model
    of flapping flight (Re ≈ 2000) to measure the aerodynamic forces on flapping wings
    of variable flexural stiffness (EI). For low to medium angles of attack, as flexibility
    of the wing increases, its ability to generate aerodynamic forces decreases monotonically
    but its lift-todrag ratios remain approximately constant. The instantaneous force
    traces reveal no major differences in the underlying modes of force generation
    for flexible and rigid wings, but the magnitude of force, the angle of net force
    vector and centre of pressure all vary systematically with wing flexibility. Even
    a rudimentary framework of wing veins is sufficient to restore the ability of
    flexible wings to generate forces at near-rigid values. Thus, the magnitude of
    force generation can be controlled by modulating the trailing edge flexibility
    and thereby controlling the magnitude of the leading edge vorticity. To characterize
    this, we have generated a detailed database of aerodynamic forces as a function
    of several variables including material properties, kinematics, aerodynamic forces
    and centre of pressure, which can also be used to help validate computational
    models of aeroelastic flapping wings. These experiments will also be useful for
    wing design for small robotic insects and, to a limited extent, in understanding
    the aerodynamics of flapping insect wings. 2009 The Royal Society.

  container-title: Journal of Medical Devices, Transactions of the ASME
  publisher: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
  volume: '10'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Instruments used in endoscopic surgery (colonoscopy surgery or natural
    orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES)) are flexible to be advanced in
    human body. However, when the end of the instrument reaches the target, the instrument
    should be rigid enough to hold its shape against external forces for better surgical
    accuracy. In order to obtain these two properties, a variable stiffness over tube
    based on low-melting-pointalloy (LMPA) is proposed in this paper. The structure
    exploits the phase transformation property of the LMPA which enables the stiffness
    change of the over tube by heating and cooling. A prototype was fabricated using
    a special molding method, and experiments were carried out to evaluate its variable
    stiffness property and response characteristics. According to experimental results,
    it costs 17 s to make the over tube transform from rigid state to flexible state
    and 18 s to make the over tube transform from flexible state to rigid state. The
    experimental results also indicated that the over tube is very rigid in rigid
    state and flexible in compliant state. A heat insulation layer was assembled to
    prevent human tissue from thermal damage. The temperature of the outer wall of
    the over tube was 42.5 °C when hot water of 80 °C was pumped into the over tube
    continually with the help of the heat insulation layer.

  volume: '22'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: 1996-2012 IEEE. In the past two decades, a large number of robot fishes
    have been built, though their performances are still far inferior compared with
    that of the real fish. One of the key reasons is the design. This paper presents
    a novel robot fish. The key innovation is the combination of an active wire-driven
    body with a soft compliant tail to accomplish undulatory swimming (i.e., flapping
    in ’S’ motion). First, the design is presented. Second, the design and analysis
    model is given. In particular, it is shown that the compliant tail can be modeled
    through the proposed multipseudolink model. Then, a prototype and experimental
    results are presented. The experiment results demonstrate that the kinematics
    of the robot fish can be predicted by the presented model with reasonable errors.
    Moreover, it has several advantages; simple in structure, easy to control, capable
    of high-speed swimming (the maximum speed is 2.15 body lengths/s), and good maneuverability
    (the average turning speed is 63°/s). Most importantly, it is highly efficient;
    the swimming performance of the robot fish is close to that of a real fish.

  abstract: As a novel biologically inspired underwater vehicle, a robotic manta ray
    (RoMan-II) has been developed for potential marine applications. Manta ray can
    perform diversified locomotion patterns in water by manipulating two wide fins.
    These motion patterns have been implemented on the developed fish robot, including
    swimming by flapping fins, turning by modulating phase relations of fins, and
    online transition of different motion patterns. The movements are achieved by
    using a model of artificial central pattern generators (CPGs) constructed with
    coupled nonlinear oscillators. This paper focuses on the analytical formulation
    of coupling terms in the CPG model and the implementation issues of the CPG-based
    control on the fish robot. The control method demonstrated on the manta ray robot
    is expected to be a framework that can tackle locomotion control problems in other
    types of multifin-actuated fish robots or more general robots with rhythmic movement
    patterns. 2011 IEEE.

  abstract: 'An experiment-based approach is proposed to improve the performance of
    biomimetic undulatory locomotion through on-line optimization. The approach is
    implemented through two steps: (1) the generation of coordinated swimming gaits
    by artificial Central Pattern Generators (CPGs); (2) an on-line searching of optimal
    parameter sets for the CPG model using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The effectiveness
    of the approach is demonstrated in the optimization of swimming speed and energy
    efficiency for a biomimetic fin propulsor. To evaluate how well the input energy
    is converted into the kinetic energy of the propulsor, an energy-efficiency index
    is presented and utilized as a feedback to regulate the on-line searching with
    a closed-loop swimming control. Experiments were conducted on propulsor prototypes
    with different fin segments and the optimal swimming patterns were found separately.
    Comparisons of results show that the optimal curvature of undulatory propulsor,
    which might have different shapes depending on the actual prototype design and
    control scheme. It is also found that the propulsor with six fin segments, is
    preferable because of higher speed and lower energy efficiency. 2014 Jilin University.'

    predators or catching prey. This contrasts with most fish-like robotic systems
    that typically operate at low frequencies (\< 2 hertz). To explore the high-frequency
    fish swimming performance space, we designed and tested a new platform based on
    yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus). Body
    kinematics, speed, and power were measured at increasing tail beat frequencies
    to quantify swimming performance and to study flow fields generated by the tail.
    Experimental analyses of freely swimming tuna and mackerel allow comparison with
    the tuna-like robotic system. The Tunabot (255 millimeters long) can achieve a
    maximum tail beat frequency of 15 hertz, which corresponds to a swimming speed
    of 4.0 body lengths per second. Comparison of midline kinematics between scombrid
    fish and the Tunabot shows good agreement over a wide range of frequencies, with
    the biggest discrepancy occurring at the caudal fin, primarily due to the rigid
    propulsor used in the robotic model. As frequency increases, cost of transport
    (COT) follows a fish-like U-shaped response with a minimum at $\sim$1.6 body lengths
    per second. The Tunabot has a range of $\sim$9.1 kilometers if it swims at 0.4
    meter per second or $\sim$4.2 kilometers at 1.0 meter per second, assuming a 10watt-hour
    battery pack. These results highlight the capabilities of high-frequency biological
    swimming and lay the foundation to explore a fish-like performance space for bio-inspired
    underwater vehicles.

  volume: '27'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. This paper presents a 3-dimensional (3D) printed
    soft parallel contactless actuator for the first time. The actuator involves an
    electro-responsive parallel mechanism made of two segments namely active chain
    and passive chain both 3D printed. The active chain is attached to the ground
    from one end and constitutes two actuator links made of responsive hydrogel. The
    passive chain, on the other hand, is attached to the active chain from one end
    and consists of two rigid links made of polymer. The actuator links are printed
    using an extrusion-based 3D-Bioplotter with polyelectrolyte hydrogel as printer
    ink. The rigid links are also printed by a 3D fused deposition modelling (FDM)
    printer with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as print material. The kinematics
    model of the soft parallel actuator is derived via transformation matrices notations
    to simulate and determine the workspace of the actuator. The printed soft parallel
    actuator is then immersed into NaOH solution with specific voltage applied to
    it via two contactless electrodes. The experimental data is then collected and
    used to develop a parametric model to estimate the end-effector position and regulate
    kinematics model in response to specific input voltage over time. It is observed
    that the electroactive actuator demonstrates expected behaviour according to the
    simulation of its kinematics model. The use of 3D printing for the fabrication
    of parallel soft actuators opens a new chapter in manufacturing sophisticated
    soft actuators with high dexterity and mechanical robustness for biomedical applications
    such as cell manipulation and drug release.

  container-title: Journal of Zoology

  volume: '240'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The mole-rat (Spalax ehrenbergi) is a solitary, subterranean rodent that
    excavates and inhabits its own tunnel system. The present study employed continuous
    radio-telemetry in order to determine the structure and use of the mole-rat’s
    territory throughout the year. The use of radiotagged animals revealed that the
    spatial division of individuals in one area cannot be predicted simply on the
    basis of the above-ground distribution of mounds. It was shown that mole-rat territories
    undergo constant change in use and location throughout the year, with tunnel lengths
    averaging 18.7 +- 4.0 m in the dry season and 39.1 +- 7.1 m in the rainy season.
    The basic pattern of the mole-rat tunnel system consisted of a main tunnel, 20-40
    cm below the ground, with several short secondary tunnels branching off it. Most
    of the nests were connected to the tunnel system by two or more exits. During
    one 24-h period, a mole-rat travelled about 17 times the total length of its territory.
    Mole-rats are active for about 50

  abstract: Self-reproduction is central to biological life for long-term sustainability
    and evolutionary adaptation. Although these traits would also be desirable in
    many engineered systems, the principles of self-reproduction have not been exploited
    in machine design. Here we create simple machines that act as autonomous modular
    robots and are capable of physical self-reproduction using a set of cubes.

  abstract: Long-term physical survivability of most robotic systems today is achieved
    through durable hardware. In contrast, most biological systems are not made of
    robust materials; long-term sustainability and evolutionary adaptation in nature
    are provided through processes of self-repair and, ultimately, self-reproduction.
    Here we demonstrate a large space of possible robots capable of autonomous self-reproduction.
    These robots are composed of actuated modules equipped with electromagnets to
    selectively control the morphology of the robotic assembly. We show a variety
    of 2-D and 3-D machines from 3 to 2n modules, and two physical implementations
    that each achieves two generations of reproduction. We show both automatically
    generated and manually designed morphologies
