  <h1>Default Single Page: Syllabus for Foldable Robotics</h1>
  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><em><strong>Foldable Robotics</strong></em> is a course organized around new types of robots being developed in research labs and industry across the country.  These devices are designed and built using layered, flat sheets of a wide variety of materials, and folded up to create both form and motion.  This class studies these devices from initial prototype and design through implementation and optimization, with a focus on application-specific projects which seek to solve problems of cost, parallelism, complexity, and time with a relatively fast and easy prototyping method.</p>
<p>This class allows students to delve deeper into the analytical problems associated with these devices, in topics such as design, manufacturing, dynamics &amp; simulation, optimization, kinematics &amp; motion, and stiffness analysis.</p>

<h2 id="asu-sync">ASU Sync</h2>
<p>This course uses Sync. ASU Sync is a technology-enhanced approach, designed to meet the dynamic needs of the class. During Sync classes, students learn remotely through live class lectures, discussions, study groups and/or tutoring. You can find out more information about ASU Sync for students here, <a href="https://provost.asu.edu/sync/students">https://provost.asu.edu/sync/students</a> and <a href="https://www.asu.edu/about/fall-2020">https://www.asu.edu/about/fall-2020</a>.</p>
<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="textbook-materials-equipment-and-personal-laptops">Textbook, Materials, Equipment, and Personal Laptops</h2>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>There is no textbook.  Selected readings from will be provided on blackboard and/or linked to online.</p>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>Please see the software list posted on the course site for more information about required and recommended software.  The software listed is either open-source and freely available to download or available through ASU.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<p>Students will be responsible for obtaining consumable materials used in their project, such as cardboard, adhesive, plastic, etc.  We may be able to supply a limited number of motors, sensors, and controllers which can be used for development, but if students wish to keep their robots they will need to purchase their own components.</p>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>Special equipment for making laminate robots is available  for use on the Poly Campus at your discretion.  If you wish to use the tools and equipment you will need to pass all safety training required by the Innovation Hub and follow all campus public health protocols.  See <a href="https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/innovation-hub/">https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/innovation-hub/</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 class="standout" id="checkout">Checkout</h3>
<p>Checkout of equipment or reusable parts may be possible through Dr. Aukes, the Innovation Hub, or Peralta Labs.  Any checked-out tools or parts must be returned in order to receive a grade in the class.</p>
<h3 id="computers">Computers</h3>
<p>It is expected that you can bring a laptop to class to complete in-class programming tasks.  You will be expected to install and use the Anaconda distribution of Python.  This class is friendly to all operating systems, but I will be using a Windows machine, so that may be easiest.  Others have used Ubuntu or OS/X on their own in the past with no problems.</p>
<h3 id="asu-sync-1">ASU Sync</h3>
<p>If attending class in-person, you will need to bring and use earbuds in the classroom; this is essential to reduce interference and cross-talk during breakout sessions.</p>
<p>If attending remotely, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliable home internet for accessing Zoom, Canvas, and other course content.</li>
<li>A webcam or smartphone with camera for participating in class as well as for data collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not able to personally finance the equipment needed to attend class via ASU Sync, ASU has a laptop and WiFi hotspot checkout program available through <a href="https://lib.asu.edu/laptops-and-hotspots">ASU Library</a>.</p>
<h3 id="other-recommended-resources">Other recommended resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Creative Cloud, available to all ASU students for free: <a href="https://uto.asu.edu/adobe-creative-cloud">https://uto.asu.edu/adobe-creative-cloud</a>.</li>
<li>Microsoft Office (<a href="https://myapps.asu.edu/app/microsoft-office-2016-home-usage">Microsoft 365</a> is free for all currently-enrolled ASU students)</li>

<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>The final project will involve designing a foldable robot using the methods introduced in this class.   The project will span the entire semester.  Teams of ~4 students will propose a research question they would like to focus on in the realm of foldable robotics.  They will survey the state of research on this topic, and craft a project of appropriate scope (with the guidance of the professor) and depth that can be accomplished in the time frame.   They will then develop a design workflow, analysis, manufacturing plan, a robot, and validating data that supports the design decisions made.</p>

<h1 id="grading-policies">Grading Policies</h1>
<p>Assignments will be posted to Canvas throughout the semester.  It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to check canvas periodically for announcements and posted material.  Assignments will cover many of the topics presented in class.  The goal of assignments is to develop a fundamental understanding of the topics required to create foldable robots, using coding to design, manufacture, and analyze.</p>
<p>Assigned work may be individual in nature, team-based, or an in-class activity.  Individual assignments will be graded on an individual basis.  The grade for team-based assignments will be shared by all participating members.  In-class work generally serves as a starting point for assigned homework, though it may be graded occasionally.  Please see the <em>&ldquo;Rubric&rdquo;</em> section of each assignment for assignment-specific expectations.</p>
<h2 id="grading-scale">Grading Scale</h2>

<h2 id="late-penalities">Late Penalities</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of this class, failing to turn in an assignment on time affects you and your classmates, as each concept builds on the last.  It is your responsibility to get in touch with the instructor regarding any questions before assignments are due.  Late submissions will lose one letter grade(10%) for every day they are late^[meaning 10% of the total possible number of points].  <strong>Any sumbission more than four days late will receive a zero.</strong>  Additionally, due to the nature of the submission process, <strong>late CATME assignments will not be accepted.</strong></p>
<p>All assignments must be posted to Canvas by <em><strong>11:59 pm</strong></em> on the day it is due unless otherwise noted in Canvas</p>

<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="submitting-and-presenting-work">Submitting and Presenting work</h2>
<p>Assignment submissions must follow the &ldquo;Submission Best Practices&rdquo; document shared on Canvas.  It outlines the expectations for well written assignments, reports, and presentations.</p>
<p>Assigned homework will be submitted for grading several different ways.  This is always indicated in the <em>&ldquo;Submission&rdquo;</em> section of each assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>It may be submitted for grading via Canvas.</li>
<li>Other work involving external tools (Google Surveys, CATME, etc) will be graded based on submitting to that external tool.</li>
<li>Some work will be presented in front of the class, and the grade derived from the presentation.</li>
<li>Other work will be compiled into the design notebook (in the form of a website or report) and graded priodically.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to pay close attention to each assignment&rsquo;s submission instructions, as each assignment indicates the method by which the work must be submitted for grading.  Failure to submit work in the manner asked for in each assignment will result in a zero.</em></strong></p>

<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="attendance--participation">Attendance &amp; Participation</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attendance is <strong>required</strong>.  More than two absences result in -2% grade reduction per missed class.</li>
<li>Absences and Tardies are treated the same</li>
<li>Attend in-person or over Zoom, <em>however</em> attendance is taken over Zoom, so <strong>always sign on to Zoom</strong>, even if attending in person</li>
<li>Email me at once of technical difficulties, but try to reconnect ASAP using other technology (Hotspot, cell-phone, call-in, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>::: {.notes}</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>This class is structured so that it can only be successful with your attendance.  Classes will be interactive, and will require you to come with questions, answers, and ideas to discuss.  Students should notify me if they will miss class, although this does not excuse them from learning the concepts or turning in their assignments on time.</p>
<p>As this is a Sync-enabled course, however, in-person attendance is not required.  It is possible to complete all assigned work remotely.</p>
<p>Thus, attendance <em>in Zoom</em> will be required to count your participation.  Attendance will be taken each class by taking a snapshot of the Zoom participant list; this may occur more than once per class.  Students are expected to sign in to Zoom on time, as important issues are often introduced within the first few minutes of class.  Tardies are thus treated as absences.  If a student is found to be either absent or inactive on Zoom, they will be counted absent.</p>
<p>In the case of technical difficulty preventing your from attending via Zoom, please contact the instructor right away over email and explain the situation.  Please try another means of reconnecting to zoom, such as over your cell-phone (by calling in or by using the Zoom app).</p>
<p><em>Attending the class in person doesn&rsquo;t change any of the above requirements.  You will still be required to sign in to Zoom to participate and be counted present.</em></p>
<p>Minus the above exceptions, missing more than <strong>two</strong> classes will result in noticeable penalties to students' participation grade, in the form of -2% off the student&rsquo;s final grade per missed class over two.^[counted as 2% of total points.]</p>
<p>Please coordinate with your fellow students to make sure someone takes notes during class if you will be unavoidably gone.  The participation grade will reflect your contribution to class, office hour sessions, and planned group meetings.</p>

<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="reorganizing-a-team">Reorganizing a Team</h2>
<h3 id="summary-2">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please try to work out any team-based issues.</li>
<li>Please see me if the team is not working.  I may choose to split the team</li>
</ul>
<p>::: {.notes}</p>
<h3 id="details-2">Details</h3>
<p>Reorganizing teams is not a desired outcome of a group project but is sometimes necessary if dysfunction rises to a level that it cannot complete the project.  One or more teammates or the instructor may initiate the process to split or reorganize a team.  Splitting teams does not necessarily work in any members' best interests, as team-based Team Assignments, which each team member must contribute to, are afterwards spread across fewer people.</p>
<p>However, if the need arises, members must work with the professor to outline the issues which are creating the need to reorganize and the measures which remaining teammates may take to rectify the situation.  This can take the form of changes made to communication, workload reallocation, new meeting times, etc.  The professor will have the final say in establishing a set of expectations for the team, which must be met within a week.  If members fail to live up to these expectations, the team may be split and reorganized by the instructor.</p>
<p>When reorganiztion occurs, each new team will set up their own folders starting with the former team&rsquo;s work, but  new material will be created by the new team, and old material adapted based on the new direction of each new team.  Any changes to the project definition due to the split (such as project scope, performance specifications, timeline, etc) will need to be rectified for all future submissions or presentations.</p>

<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>::: {.notes}
This class is meant to teach you how to create and use your own design tools for creating folding robots using a variety of published resources, online resources, and classroom content.  I encourage you to plumb the depths of what&rsquo;s available; through this synthesis you might be able to create something unique.  However, I expect to be able to tell what is your work and what is someone else&rsquo;s.  For this reason, specific rules for this class are:
:::</p>
<h3 id="specific-rules">Specific Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do your own work for individual assignments and tests.</li>
<li>Include the your sources of inspiration within assignments and projects.  This will help grow the list of cool references, but more importantly, help distinguish inspiration from wholesale plagarism.</li>
<li>Keep code/text/information you use from outside sources separate from your own original content (through the use of separate folders, for example).  Make it explicit what is yours and what is not.</li>
<li>Include all the licenses or copyright statements as required by the things you reuse.  This will make your own code more reuseable for yourself and potentially others in the future.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy">https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy</a> for more info.</li>
</ul>
<p>::: {.notes}
Students in this class must adhere to ASU’s academic integrity policy, which can be found at <a href="https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy">https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy</a>). Students are responsible for reviewing this policy and understanding each of the areas in which academic dishonesty can occur. In addition, all engineering students are expected to adhere to both the ASU Academic Integrity Honor Code and the Fulton Schools of Engineering Honor Code. All academic integrity violations will be reported to the Fulton Schools of Engineering Academic Integrity Office (AIO).  The AIO maintains record of all violations and has access to academic integrity violations committed in all other ASU college/schools.

<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="disability-accommodations">Disability Accommodations</h2>
<p>\small</p>
<p>Suitable accommodations will be made for students having disabilities. Students needing accommodations must register with the ASU Disabilities Resource Center and provide documentation of that registration to the instructor. Students should communicate the need for an accommodation in sufficient time for it to be properly arranged. See <a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-08.html">ACD 304-08</a> Classroom and Testing Accommodations for Students with Disabilities.</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal antidiscrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. One element of this legislation requires that all qualified students with documented disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation please contact the Disability Resource Center at ASU Polytechnic located in Student Affairs Quad # 4 or call 480-727-1039 / TTY: 480-727-1009.

<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="harassment-and-sexual-discrimination">Harassment and Sexual Discrimination</h2>
<p>\small</p>
<p>Arizona State University is committed to providing an environment free of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation for the entire university community, including all students, faculty members, staff employees, and guests. ASU expressly prohibits discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by employees, students, contractors, or agents of the university based on any protected status: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and genetic information.</p>
<p>Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.  Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited.  An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university.  If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at <a href="https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs">https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs</a>.</p>
<p>Mandated sexual harassment reporter: As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence.  ASU Counseling Services, <a href="https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling">https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling</a>, is available if you wish discuss any concerns confidentially and privately.</p>
