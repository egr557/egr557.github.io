  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong><em>Foldable Robotics</em></strong> is a course organized around new types of robots being developed in research labs and industry across the country. These devices are designed and built using layered, flat sheets of a wide variety of materials, and folded up to create both form and motion. This class studies these devices from initial prototype and design through implementation and optimization, with a focus on application-specific projects which seek to solve problems of cost, parallelism, complexity, and time with a relatively fast and easy prototyping method.</p>
<p>This class allows students to delve deeper into the analytical problems associated with these devices, in topics such as design, manufacturing, dynamics &amp; simulation, optimization, kinematics &amp; motion, and stiffness analysis.</p>

<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>There is no textbook. Selected readings from will be provided on blackboard and/or linked to online.</p>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>Please see the software list posted on the course site for more information about required and recommended software. The software listed is either open-source and freely available to download or available through ASU.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<p>Students will be responsible for obtaining consumable materials used in their project, such as cardboard, adhesive, plastic, etc. We may be able to supply a limited number of motors, sensors, and controllers which can be used for development, but if students wish to keep their robots they will need to purchase their own components.</p>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>Special equipment for making laminate robots is available for use on the Poly Campus at your discretion. If you wish to use the tools and equipment you will need to pass all safety training required by the Innovation Hub and follow all campus public health protocols. See <a href="https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/innovation-hub/" class="uri">https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/innovation-hub/</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 class="standout" id="checkout">Checkout</h3>

<h3 id="computers">Computers</h3>
<p>It is expected that you can bring a laptop to class to complete in-class programming tasks. You will be expected to install and use the Anaconda distribution of Python. This class is friendly to all operating systems, but I will be using a Windows machine, so that may be easiest. Others have used Ubuntu or OS/X on their own in the past with no problems.</p>
<h3 id="asu-sync-1">ASU Sync</h3>
<p>If attending class in-person, you will need to bring and use earbuds in the classroom; this is essential to reduce interference and cross-talk during breakout sessions.</p>
<p>If attending remotely, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliable home internet for accessing Zoom, Canvas, and other course content.</li>
<li>A webcam or smartphone with camera for participating in class as well as for data collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not able to personally finance the equipment needed to attend class via ASU Sync, ASU has a laptop and WiFi hotspot checkout program available through <a href="https://lib.asu.edu/laptops-and-hotspots">ASU Library</a>.</p>
<h3 id="other-recommended-resources">Other recommended resources</h3>

</ul>
<!--There are 20 workstations arranged around the perimeter of Tech 162 with computers.  Anaconda is already installed, but it will be difficult to follow along when you're pointed the other direction from the front of the room.  We will use the workstations for your device development, but if you are able, please bring laptops to class.  You'll be able to follow along in the front a lot easier.  If you don't have a laptop that you can bring, we'll try to put you in the closer workstations.
-->
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>The final project will involve designing a foldable robot using the methods introduced in this class. The project will span the entire semester. Teams of ~4 students will propose a research question they would like to focus on in the realm of foldable robotics. They will survey the state of research on this topic, and craft a project of appropriate scope (with the guidance of the professor) and depth that can be accomplished in the time frame. They will then develop a design workflow, analysis, manufacturing plan, a robot, and validating data that supports the design decisions made.</p>
<!--
Each week, students will bring their assignments or projects to class and we will discuss their progress & roadblocks.

The goal for this project is to use all of the things you are learning in foldable robotics in order to create a small, lightweight foldable robot.
-->
<!--
A successful project will achieve the following objectives:

### Project Objectives
You should use the content introduced in this course.  All of these points must be addressed in presentations, and must be okayed by the professor.

* **bioinspiration:** Develop a robot inspired by the motion of something in the natural world. 
    * Demonstrate knowledge of your animal.  
    * Translate features and attributes from animal template to robot design.
    * Biomimicry is not required
* **kinematics:** the robot should have a clear, well-thought-out through transmission design facilitated by the concepts taught in this class (and confirmed through analysis).
    * Use a kinematic or dynamic work loop to perform locomotion (rather than rely on friction) or single-path motion.
    * Use a kinematic transmission design to transform rotary or linear actuation into a designed motion path.
    * Analyze the kinematics and dynamics of your system.
    * solve constraint equations and plot motion of transmission using a nonlinear solver
    * compute numerical jacobian of transmission to determine gear ratios
    * Use dynamics software to analyze forces and motion of system.
    * Selection of motors based on power needs determined via kinematics.
* **laminate manufacturing:** This robot should be made using the techniques taught in this class.  3d printing, soft robotics, off-the-shelf parts, and metal should take a back seat.
    * May feature 3d printed connectors for convenience, but must primarily create motion through laminate hinge devices.  
    * Must discuss kinematics with Instructor.
    * Demonstrate knowledge and mastery of layer-based design and manufacturing topics
    * Use a five-layer laminate design reflecting design practices outlined in class.
    * Automate the workflow from design parameters to cut files.  Hand-drawn dxf's by the end of this project will not be allowed
* **design:** you should incorporate traditional engineering design principles into your process, by factoring in models, design parameters / variables, and try to optimize or design for some goal via a combination of iterative simulation, prototyping, and/or (ideally) optimization.
* **prototyping:** you should iterate your robot often.  I shouldn't see the same robot 3 weeks in a row.
* **sensing:** you should know the state of your robot via one or more methods, and use that in your analysis.
    * Example sensors include joint angle sensors, encoders, IMU, voltage/current sensors, etc.
    * External sensing is okay provided you have discussed with the instructor.  Examples include force-plate data, load cell data, etc, for the purposes of verifying models and improving the design.
* **experimentation: ** you should confirm the models you use.  This should be discussed and planned with me early, and planned out with your sensor selection, your kinematic design, and your particular dynamics.  
    * Coordinate this activity with your sensor selection.
* **stiffness analysis:** you should analyze one or more of the structures on your device in order to tune its stiffness / compliance for the intended type of locomotion you need.
    * compute the deflection of a 2d laminate beam design using bernoulli-euler bending equations.
    * Designs should be integrated, analyzed, and tuned in your final device
* **dynamic:** the robot should feature some element(s) that require analysis of motion as a function of time, mass, inertia, stiffness, damping, etc.  Ideally, your robot bounces, hops, etc, incorporating those factors into its primary motion.

## Learn Linux
Depending on what software you need for your programming assignments and projects, you may want to consider using Linux, which has a variety of software not available for Windows machines.  We have also VirtualBox on the class computers, so that you can run Ubuntu Linux in order to access this software.  If you've ever wanted to try out Ubuntu, this is a good opportunity, as you should be able to complete all assignments and projects with the open-source software available in Ubuntu.  So if you want the challenge, consider installing virtualbox on your computer and downloading and installing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on it.  I have a recipe for installing Anaconda for Ubuntu as well.

### Entrepreneurial Mindset and the 3 C's

**Curiosity:** Laminate robotics permits students to iterate quickly and investigate new mechanisms using ultra-low-cost, origami-inspired prototyping techniques. Motion can be prototyped via folding, permitting students without the technical, programming, or mathematical background to participate in a development process which is usually reserved for experts in design, simulation, robotics, control, and/or computer science.  Through these manufacturing activities, students become motivated to become experts, leaving the class with a taste for the design process and an appreciation for the complexity of robotics.  This class will accelerate those prototyping abilities by providing high-performance hardware for class projects as needed.

**Creating Value:** This course will focus on several real-world application areas (such as mine-clearing, terrestrial locomotion, agriculture, etc) in order to solve problems which laminate robots are better suited to address than traditional robots.  These applications will be pitched by both instructor and student during the first few weeks.  Each application should share core challenges in design, analysis, modeling, and experimentation, requiring teams to simulate, prototype, and test early and often.  Applications should have a real-world connection in which traditional robot solutions have failed, or not yet been developed.  Laminate robots, fabricated at low cost and with fewer moving parts, are more resilient to dirt, dust, and damage while lowering the impact if something does indeed break.  Selected applications should also consider laminate robots’ ability to operate in parallel to improve the health, safety, and security of high-risk areas around the world.

**Connections:**  This class will connect students to opportunities in a way other classes don't.  Whether its attached to the human body, out in the desert, or in an office, we will test projects in their native environments to help identify core design challenges related to their selected application.  This will help  focus designs early and to motivate how to address the real challenges of making robots solve "real world" challenges.  In addition, this course will host guest lectures from several ASU faculty working on these concepts, as well as a special guest lecture from an industrial partner.

## Peer Grading

Some aspects of the course will utilize student feedback during the grading process, including but not limited to peer evaluations of individual contributions to the project, as well as design review presentations.  Student feedback may be used as a direct grade or considered within the instructor's grade at the instructors' discretion.
-->
<h2 id="late-penalities">Late Penalities</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of this class, failing to turn in an assignment on time affects you and your classmates, as each concept builds on the last. It is your responsibility to get in touch with the instructor regarding any questions before assignments are due. Late submissions will lose one letter grade(10%) for every day they are late<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. <strong>Any sumbission more than four days late will receive a zero.</strong> Additionally, due to the nature of the submission process, <strong>late CATME assignments will not be accepted.</strong></p>
<p>All assignments must be posted to Canvas by <strong><em>11:59 pm</em></strong> on the day it is due unless otherwise noted in Canvas</p>
<!--
557 Projects must participate in the Innovation Showcase on Friday, April 27.  Individual attendance is not required, but team attendance is.  Students should coordinate with their team and instructor to ensure that their project can be operated or displayed for the entirety of Innovation Showcase.

<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="submitting-and-presenting-work">Submitting and Presenting work</h2>
<p>Assignment submissions must follow the “Submission Best Practices” document shared on Canvas. It outlines the expectations for well written assignments, reports, and presentations.</p>
<p>Assigned homework will be submitted for grading several different ways. This is always indicated in the <em>“Submission”</em> section of each assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>It may be submitted for grading via Canvas.<br />
</li>
<li>Other work involving external tools (Google Surveys, CATME, etc) will be graded based on submitting to that external tool.<br />
</li>
<li>Some work will be presented in front of the class, and the grade derived from the presentation.<br />
</li>
<li>Other work will be compiled into the design notebook (in the form of a website or report) and graded priodically.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>It is the student’s responsibility to pay close attention to each assignment’s submission instructions, as each assignment indicates the method by which the work must be submitted for grading. Failure to submit work in the manner asked for in each assignment will result in a zero.</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attendance is <strong>required</strong>. More than two absences result in -2% grade reduction per missed class.</li>
<li>Absences and Tardies are treated the same</li>
<li>Attend in-person or over Zoom, <em>however</em> attendance is taken over Zoom, so <strong>always sign on to Zoom</strong>, even if attending in person</li>
<li>Email me at once of technical difficulties, but try to reconnect ASAP using other technology (Hotspot, cell-phone, call-in, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<section id="details" class="notes">
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>This class is structured so that it can only be successful with your attendance. Classes will be interactive, and will require you to come with questions, answers, and ideas to discuss. Students should notify me if they will miss class, although this does not excuse them from learning the concepts or turning in their assignments on time.</p>
<p>As this is a Sync-enabled course, however, in-person attendance is not required. It is possible to complete all assigned work remotely.</p>
<p>Thus, attendance <em>in Zoom</em> will be required to count your participation. Attendance will be taken each class by taking a snapshot of the Zoom participant list; this may occur more than once per class. Students are expected to sign in to Zoom on time, as important issues are often introduced within the first few minutes of class. Tardies are thus treated as absences. If a student is found to be either absent or inactive on Zoom, they will be counted absent.</p>
<p>In the case of technical difficulty preventing your from attending via Zoom, please contact the instructor right away over email and explain the situation. Please try another means of reconnecting to zoom, such as over your cell-phone (by calling in or by using the Zoom app).</p>
<p><em>Attending the class in person doesn’t change any of the above requirements. You will still be required to sign in to Zoom to participate and be counted present.</em></p>
<p>Minus the above exceptions, missing more than <strong>two</strong> classes will result in noticeable penalties to students’ participation grade, in the form of -2% off the student’s final grade per missed class over two.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Please coordinate with your fellow students to make sure someone takes notes during class if you will be unavoidably gone. The participation grade will reflect your contribution to class, office hour sessions, and planned group meetings.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Reorganizing teams is not a desired outcome of a group project but is sometimes necessary if dysfunction rises to a level that it cannot complete the project. One or more teammates or the instructor may initiate the process to split or reorganize a team. Splitting teams does not necessarily work in any members’ best interests, as team-based Team Assignments, which each team member must contribute to, are afterwards spread across fewer people.</p>
<p>However, if the need arises, members must work with the professor to outline the issues which are creating the need to reorganize and the measures which remaining teammates may take to rectify the situation. This can take the form of changes made to communication, workload reallocation, new meeting times, etc. The professor will have the final say in establishing a set of expectations for the team, which must be met within a week. If members fail to live up to these expectations, the team may be split and reorganized by the instructor.</p>
<p>When reorganiztion occurs, each new team will set up their own folders starting with the former team’s work, but new material will be created by the new team, and old material adapted based on the new direction of each new team. Any changes to the project definition due to the split (such as project scope, performance specifications, timeline, etc) will need to be rectified for all future submissions or presentations.</p>

<!--# Background
This class is emerging from a class called *Informal Robotics*, taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2015 and 2016.  This class was developed by Chuch Hoberman, Daniel Aukes, and Jonathan Grinham, and introduced this and similar manufacturing methods to a group of mostly graduate students in design along with students from Harvard College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and MIT Engineering Students.  Classes paired lessons on the essentials of design, deployable structures, kinematics, manufacturing, and mechatronics, while presentations by guest researchers provided the context by which students understood the impact these new prototyping methods are having in research labs.  This class was the first joint collaboration between the Wyss Institute and the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and resulted in a symposium titled "Informal Robotics" in October 2016 which brought several high-impact researchers to the GSD to speak about their work in the field.   
-->
<!--# Course Activities

The following activities will occupy the majority of your time in this class:

* Reading and research.
* Design & fabrication of laminate robots using rapid prototpying techniques.
* Completing assignments and projects by programming in Python
-->
<!--
## Proposed Focus
Laminate Robotics will focus more deeply on the engineering topics required to be able to develop not only this class of devices, but to enable students to craft their own design tools from scratch as new manufacturing methods emerge from the research lab.  This class will focus on topics essential to robot designers, from kinematic and dynamic analysis and simulation, to strength of materials and FEA.

### Kinematics
The kinematics of laminate devices is inherently complex, because the network of folds created in 2D are spherical, nonlinear, and begin moving from a kinematic singularity.  All of these factors makes it non-intuitive to visualize and design motion from a network of rotational hinges.  We will introduce the concept of reference frames, degrees of freedom, and transformations, and demonstrate how these tools can be applied to serial and parallel systems consisting of rotational and translational elements.
- Suggested reading: McCarthy

### Dynamics
Extending on the kinematics section, we will discuss the concepts of stiffness and damping as a function of the material properties of these multi-material systems, and analyze and discuss the impact rotational stiffness can have on an ideal kinematic system.  While the materials are typically lightweight, weight and inertia can also play a role in systems dominated by soft passive elements.  We will introduce tools for creating equations of motion and simulating multi-rigid-body systems.
- Suggested Reading: Kane

### Simulation
Students will be introduced to the basics of dynamic simulation and be given the opportunity to create a simulation for a particular dynamic system.  Performance of their device will be evaluated across several scenarios and parameter sets, with students being asked to find and optimize designs.

### Manufacturing
The analysis of flat laminate systems requires pairing an understanding of the mathematical representation of laminates with the abilities, constraints, and limitations of the manufacturing methods used to make them.  We will introduce concepts such as constructive solid geometry, tool workspace, assembly/disassembly in order to provide students an understanding of manufacturability for this process.
- Suggested Reading: ?

### Stiffness Analysis
As these systems are composed of materials as soft as plastic, paper, and cardboard, and as rigid as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and steel, there can be a wide range of performance with respect to the material systems used.  However, it has been observed that the precise kinematics of such systems can deviate widely from nominal in the presence of links which bend and deform under load.  This can have the effect of increasing the effective degrees of freedom, permitting unintended bending and twisting, which can result in shorter system lifespan and unintended, unmodeled behavior.  We will introduce the basic elements of FEA in order to analyze system performance.
-->
<!--
## Final Projects

### Design Tool Creation
We will ask students to create a design tool for a novel manufacturing system, programmed in Python.  This  project will permit students to create reusable planning software which they can use to

### Simulation Project
Simulate the performance of a class of designs, find global optimum

### Controls & Optimization
Create a controller which can be optimized for a quadruped / hexapod walking robot.

### Robotic Application
Make a robotic or active laminate device that encodes unique motion through a novel transmission design

# Data Collection for Research Purposes

You will be given more information and an opportunity to participate in research investigating effective teaching methods with regard to manufacturing topics.  This will involve collecting assignment and project submissions as well as physical artifacts that you build in class for the purposes of studying effective teaching and learning practices with regards to building manufacturing knowledge.  I will also collect samples of your work, video submissions you make, and final presentations.  For more information, please refer to the disclosure form, which you will receive on the first day of class.
